There's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user mentioned \"Caesar salad without anchovies,\" so foodItem is \"Caesar salad,\" and removeIngredients should be \"anchovies.\" No new ingredients or special instructions are specified, so those can be default or empty.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123.\" The new_preferences need to include size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type, and special_instructions. The user specified large, hot, regular sweetness, almond milk. So the new_preferences dict should have those values. Special instructions aren't mentioned, so it can be empty.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The given URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination is optional, but since the next steps refer to the repo directory, maybe I should clone it to a specific directory. But the default is the current directory, so maybe just use that. So call clone_repo with repo_url as provided.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory_name would be the repo's root. Let's say the directory is \"nodejs-welcome\". Wait, but the clone Repo's destination is not specified, so maybe the directory name is the same as the repo name. But I need to check. The repo URL is nodejs-welcome.git, so the directory would likely be nodejs-welcome. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nOnce analyzed, create/update Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires directory_name. So use the same directory. Then create Kubernetes YAMLs with create_kubernetes_yaml_file, again using the same directory. \n\nAfter modifying files, need to push changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit message, etc. The user says to add all changed files, so the function should handle git add. Commit message is not specified, so use the default \"Update changes\" unless told otherwise. Branch is default main. \n\nWait, the user's step 2.1 says create/update Dockerfile based on analysis. The analysis might determine the language, which would influence the Dockerfile. But the create_a_docker_file function doesn't take parameters for language, so maybe the function is designed to handle that internally based on the directory's contents. So just call it with the directory name.\n\nPutting it all together: first clone, then analyze, then create Dockerfile, then create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. Each step depends on the previous. So the function calls should be in order. But the system might execute them sequentially. So the assistant needs to generate each function call in order."}

The user might expect me to know the recipient, but since it's not given, maybe I should assume it's Shishir's actual contact info.

Alternatively, maybe the search result would include the recipient's info. Hmm, but the search is for the birthday date, not the recipient. \n\nWait, the user says \"send a message regardless\", so maybe after finding the date, the message is sent to Shishir. But without knowing his email or phone, the function might not work. However, the 'send_message' function's recipient has a default, but that's probably a placeholder.

If \"Shishir\" is the username, maybe that's acceptable. \n\nSo the steps are: first, search for Shishir's birthday, then send the message. So first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\". Then, based on the result, send the message. But since I can only make one function call per turn, I need to start with the search. Then, in the next turn, after getting the result, send the message. But the user wants both steps done. However, the assistant can only make one function call at a time. So the first step is to perform the search. The user's question requires two actions: find the date and send the message. But since the assistant can't do both in one go, the first function call is the search. The next step would be to send the message once the date is known. But since the current turn is to process the user's request, maybe the assistant needs to chain the functions. However, according to the instructions, each turn is a single function call. So the first response is to call recall_memory_search. Then, after the result is obtained, the next turn would handle sending the message. But the user is asking for both in one go. However, the assistant must proceed step by step. So the first function call is to search for the birthday. The user's instruction says to make one or more function calls. But the assistant can only make one per turn. So in this case, the first function call is the search. The next step would be to send the message once the search result is available. But since the user is asking to do both, maybe the assistant needs to make two function calls in sequence. However, according to the problem statement, each turn is a single function call. Therefore, the assistant must first call recall_memory_search, and then in a subsequent turn, after receiving the result, call send_message. But the user's question is a single request. However, the system processes each turn one at a time. Therefore, the correct first step is to call recall_memory_search with the query for Shishir's birthday. Then, once the result is retrieved, the next step would be to send the message. But since the user is asking for both actions, the assistant needs to handle them in sequence. However, in the current turn, the assistant can only make the first function call. Therefore, the correct answer is to first call recall_memory_search with the query \"Shishir's birthday\"."}

They're working on a Java project and encountering a compilation error related to the 'StringNumberHandler' class extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The specific issue is that 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and since they didn't mention case sensitivity, I'll default to False.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides. The 'get_signature' function requires 'class_name', 'method_name', and optionally 'include_private'. Since the user didn't mention private methods, I'll use the default of False. I'll call this function twice, once for each method.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided. For 'get_relevant_classes', 'search_string' is required, which is given. For 'get_signature', both 'class_name' and 'method_name' are required. The user provided both the class and method names. \n\nI should also check if the functions are applicable. The 'get_relevant_classes' is designed for searching in the repository, which fits the first request. The 'get_signature' function retrieves method signatures, which addresses the second part. \n\nNo parameters are missing, so both function calls are valid. The user is working in Java, but the functions don't specify a language, so assuming they work across languages or the system handles it. \n\nThus, the correct tool calls are to use 'get_relevant_classes' for 'CellResult' with subdirectories and 'get_signature' for both methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'."}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method found for 'get_weather(String)'. They want to know the available methods and properties of the 'Weather' class and check if 'get_weather' exists there.\n\nFirst, I need to retrieve the class information for 'Weather'. The function get_class_info is perfect for this. The parameters required are class_name, and optionally include_private and module_name. Since the user didn't mention a module, I'll assume it's in the current module. Also, unless specified, I shouldn't include private methods, so include_private is False by default.\n\nSo, the first function call should be get_class_info with class_name set to 'Weather'. That will give me the list of methods and properties. \n\nNext, the user specifically asked for the signature of the 'get_weather' method if it exists. For that, I should use get_signature. The required parameters are class_name and method_name. Again, class_name is 'Weather' and method_name is 'get_weather'. The include_private parameter is optional here as well, defaulting to False. \n\nWait, but what if the method is private? The user didn't specify, so sticking to the defaults makes sense. If the method isn't found, the function might return nothing, which would explain the compilation error. But I need to check both steps.\n\nSo, two function calls: first to get the class info, then to get the method signature. Both using the same class name. I should structure the tool calls accordingly. Make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the required types. No other functions seem necessary here.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd available. The parameters required are two non-negative integers. The user provided 36 and 48, which are both non-negative, so that's straightforward. I can use the math_gcd function here by passing a=48 and b=36. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Since 48 is larger than 36, I should set a=48 and b=36. That should give the correct GCD.\n\nNow, the second part is about finding the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. Steepness here refers to the derivative of the function at that point. The available function for this is estimate_derivative. The parameters needed are the function, the point x, and optionally dx and method. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2, which I can represent as a lambda function. The point x is 5. The default dx is 0.0001 and method is 'central', so unless specified otherwise, those defaults can be used. So I need to call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5.0. The dx and method can be omitted since they have defaults. \n\nWait, the parameters for estimate_derivative require 'function' as a callable and 'x' as a float. The user's function is x squared, so that's easy. The x value is 5, which as a float is 5.0. So the function call should include those parameters. \n\nI need to make sure both functions are called correctly. The first function call is math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. The second is estimate_derivative with the function and x. Since the user asked for both, I need to execute both function calls in sequence. \n\nLet me check if there are any missing parameters. For math_gcd, both a and b are required, and they are provided. For estimate_derivative, function and x are required, which are also provided. The other parameters have defaults, so they're optional. \n\nSo the correct tool calls would be first math_gcd with the two numbers, then estimate_derivative with the function and x value.

The math_gcd function requires two positive integers. The parameters here are 36 and 48, both integers. So I can directly use the math_gcd function with a=48 and b=36. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Since 48 is larger than 36, I should set a=48 and b=36.

The default dx is 0.001 and method is central, so unless specified otherwise, those defaults can be used. So I need to call estimate_derivative with function as the lambda, x=5, and rely on the defaults for dx and method.

The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned 5 cm. The function expects a float, so I'll use 5.0 as the value. The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention handling units, so I just pass the numerical value. That should calculate 5 squared, which is 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a 'location' parameter. Queenstown is a place in Singapore, so the location should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function allows formats like \"City, Country\", so this fits. The unit parameter is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit, but since the user didn't specify, I'll omit it or use the default. However, in Singapore, Celsius is more commonly used, but the function's default is Fahrenheit. Hmm, maybe the user expects Celsius. Wait, the function's default is Fahrenheit, but the user might prefer Celsius. Should I specify it? The question doesn't mention the unit, so maybe stick to the default. But maybe it's better to include unit='celsius' since Singapore uses Celsius. The function allows specifying it, so perhaps include that for accuracy.\n\nSo, two function calls: one for the area with size 5.0, and another for the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Check if all required parameters are present. For get_area_of_square, 'size' is required and provided. For get_current_weather, 'location' is required and provided as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The unit is optional, so it's okay to include or omit. Since the user didn't specify, using the default (Fahrenheit) might not be ideal, but the function allows it. Alternatively, adding unit='celsius' would be better. Let me check the function's parameters again. The unit has a default of Fahrenheit, but the user might expect Celsius. Since the function allows specifying, maybe include it. But the user didn't ask for a specific unit, so perhaps leave it as default. Hmm. Well, the function's default is Fahrenheit, but in Singapore, weather is reported in Celsius. To be accurate, maybe set unit to 'celsius'.

That sounds like rotating the image. Looking at the functions, there's rotateImageAction. The parameters for that include degrees, image_format, and keep_original. The degrees should be 20, and the default image_format is JPEG, which should be fine unless specified otherwise. The keep_original has a default of True, so maybe the user wants to keep the original, but I'll just use the default unless told otherwise.\n\nNext, the \"flip it horizontally\" part. The flipImageAction function is for flipping, and the flip_direction needs to be 'horizontal' as per the enum. So that's straightforward. The parameters required are just flip_direction.\n\nWait, but the order matters here. Should I rotate first and then flip? The user said \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally\". The order in which the functions are called might affect the result. But since the user didn't specify the order, maybe I should assume they want both actions done. However, the functions are separate, so I need to call both. But how does the system handle the sequence? Since each function is a separate action, I need to call rotateImageAction first, then flipImageAction, or vice versa. But the user's instruction is to turn and then flip, so probably rotate first, then flip.\n\nBut the problem is, the parameters for each function. For rotateImageAction, the required parameter is degrees. The user provided 20, so that's covered. For flipImageAction, the required parameter is flip_direction, which is 'horizontal' here. So both functions can be called with the given parameters. The other parameters have defaults, so they can be omitted unless needed.\n\nSo the correct function calls would be first rotateImageAction with degrees=20, then flipImageAction with flip_direction='horizontal'. The user didn't mention image paths or formats, but the functions have defaults. For example, rotateImageAction's image_format defaults to JPEG, and flipImageAction doesn't require any other parameters. So I think that's all. The user's request has all the necessary parameters for both functions. So I should generate the two function calls in the correct order."}

The other functions are for sharing location, rental cars, or attractions, which don't apply here. So the answer should have two get_current_weather calls."}

The user wants all pending and active mandates for users named Parath and Bhanu. Hmm, looking at the available functions, there's user.mandates which fetches mandates for a specific user based on name and status. The partner.mandates function is for partners, but the user mentioned specific user names, so probably user.mandates is the right one here.\n\nWait, the user mentioned two users: Parath and Bhanu. The user.mandates function requires the 'name' parameter. But the function seems to take a single name at a time. So I might need to call the function twice, once for each user. Also, the status can be 'pending' or 'active'. But the function's status parameter is a single value, not a list. So for each user, I need to make two calls: one with status 'active' and another with 'pending'? Or can I combine them somehow?\n\nWait, the function's status parameter has an enum of 'active', 'pending', 'inactive', with a default of 'active'. So if the user wants both pending and active, I need to make separate calls for each status. But the user wants both for each user. So for Parath, call user.mandates with name=Parath, status=active and another with status=pending. Same for Bhanu. But that would be four calls total. Alternatively, is there a way to get both statuses in one call? The function doesn't seem to allow multiple statuses. So yes, four separate calls are needed.\n\nWait, but the user said \"all pending and active mandates of users parath and bhanu\". So maybe the user wants all mandates where the status is either pending or active for those two users. Since the function can't take multiple statuses or names, I need to make individual calls for each combination. So for each user (Parath and Bhanu), make two calls each for status active and pending. That's four function calls. Let me structure that."}
