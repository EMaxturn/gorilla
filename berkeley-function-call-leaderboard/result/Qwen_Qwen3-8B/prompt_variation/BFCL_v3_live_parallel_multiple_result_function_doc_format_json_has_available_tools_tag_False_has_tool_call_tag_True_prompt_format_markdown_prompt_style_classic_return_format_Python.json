First, they want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. Looking at the available functions, there's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters required are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the food item. They mentioned removing anchovies, so I should set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be needed if there's anything else, but the user didn't specify beyond removing anchovies.\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences include size: large, temperature: hot, sweetness_level: regular, milk_type: almond. The special_instructions field is optional here, but the user didn't mention any, so it can be omitted. I need to structure the new_preferences as a dictionary with those values.\n\nWait, the function parameters for ChaDri.change_drink have drink_id as a string and new_preferences as a dict. So I'll map each parameter correctly. For the food, the ChaFod function's foodItem is \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". The other parameters like newIngredients and specialInstructions can be left as default since they're not mentioned. \n\nI need to make sure both function calls are correctly formatted. Let me check the parameters again. For ChaFod, the required parameter is foodItem, which is provided. For ChaDri, drink_id is 123 and new_preferences includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, and milk_type. All the necessary parameters are there. No missing info. So both functions can be called as per the user's request."}

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory might be the same as the repo name. Let's assume the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'. So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'. This will determine the main programming language, which is probably JavaScript/Node.js.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using the same directory name. So call create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'). \n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. The parameters include deployment_name, image_name, etc. Since the analysis might show Node.js, the image name could be something like 'nodejs-welcome' with the image tag as 'latest'. The user didn't specify custom names, so use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, commit_message, branch_name. The user didn't specify a message, so use the default 'Update changes'. Branch is 'main' by default. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The function push_git_changes_to_github automatically git adds changes, so that's covered. \n\nI need to make sure all functions are called in order. Let me check parameters again. The clone_repo's destination is default, so no need to specify. The analyse_repo_contents needs the directory name. The Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs also need the directory name. The push function needs the directory name and defaults for commit and branch. \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly."}

So, I'll call get_signature twice: once for 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'setCellValue', and again for 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'getCellValue'. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. Maybe the methods they're overriding in 'AbstractCellHandler' are expecting 'getNumericValue' from 'CellResult', which isn't present.

That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned \"Queenstown Singapore,\" but I should check if that's a valid location. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user might be referring to Queenstown in Singapore? Or maybe it's a typo. However, I should take the user's input as given. The location parameter can be in the format \"City, Country\" or \"City, State (abbr)\".

The unit is optional with a default of fahrenheit, but since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default. \n\nWait, but does Singapore have a state abbreviation?
