The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nLooking at the parameters required for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. All required parameters are there. The rounding parameter is optional, but since the question doesn't specify, I can leave it as default (2 decimals). \n\nI don't see any missing parameters. So I should call calculate_displacement with those values. The other function is for final speed, which isn't needed here.

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going when it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the kinematics equations. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, and time is 4 seconds. The formula for speed when starting from rest is probably the one that relates initial velocity, acceleration, and time. But wait, the user mentioned constant acceleration, so maybe they want to use the equation that relates initial velocity, acceleration, and distance.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. The description says it calculates the speed when starting from rest under constant acceleration. So that seems exactly what's needed here.\n\nThe parameters required are distance (20 meters), time (4 seconds), and initial_speed (0). The function's default for initial_speed is 0, so we don't need to specify it. So the function call should be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. That should give the speed. I don't see any other parameters needed here. The other function, calculate_acceleration, might be for different scenarios, but since the question is about speed, not acceleration, we can ignore that."}

But the question is about the current most popular color, so the period might not be necessary if the default is sufficient. Wait, the default is Daily, but the user might want the most recent data. However, the function's description says the period is for checking trends over a certain time frame. If the user is asking for the current trend, maybe the period is not needed.
