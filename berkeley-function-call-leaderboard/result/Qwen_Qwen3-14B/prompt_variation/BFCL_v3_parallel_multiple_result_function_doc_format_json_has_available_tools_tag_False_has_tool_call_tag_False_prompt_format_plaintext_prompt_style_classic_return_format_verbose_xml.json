The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which should be fine here.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns.

The parameters for that function include x, y, and return_residuals. The user specified to calculate and return residuals, so return_residuals should be True.\n\nWait, but the data_loading function's output is a data structure. The user probably expects that after loading, the data is in a format where columns can be accessed via keys.

The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures. The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it retrieves the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nFor the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. But the size parameter expects an array of integers. So I need to convert 4 ft x 4 ft into an array, maybe [4, 4]. Similarly, the second sculpture is in New York, bronze, 6x3 ft, so size [6, 3].\n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for sculpture_size are an array of integers. The user provided feet measurements, but the function doesn't specify units. Assuming that the integers are in feet, so the array would be [4,4] and [6,3]. \n\nSo I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each sculpture. The first call with museum_location: Philadelphia, sculpture_material: marble, sculpture_size: [4,4]. The second call with museum_location: New York, sculpture_material: bronze, sculpture_size: [6,3]. \n\nThen, once I get both prices, I can calculate the average. But the user is asking for the average, so the functions need to return the individual prices first. The functions themselves don't calculate averages, so the system would need to handle that after retrieving the prices. However, the user's question requires two separate function calls to get each price, then compute the average. \n\nSo the correct approach is to make two separate calls to get_artwork_price with the respective parameters for each sculpture. The parameters are all provided by the user, so no missing info. The function requires museum_location, material, and size. Both sculptures have those details. So the answer should be two function calls."}

The substance here is glucose (C6H12O6), and the default joules_per_mol is 2800 kJ/mol. So, I'll use that function with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800.0.\n\nNext, using the energy from the first step, calculate the biomass with a 10% efficiency. The function here is biological.calc_biomass, which needs energy and efficiency. The efficiency is given as 10%, so 0.1 in decimal.

The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So principle is 5000, duration 5, annual rate 4. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually for 5 years. The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. Parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1.

The function here is future_value. The parameters required are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The interest rate is 5%, so 0.05 as a decimal.

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985, and location San Francisco. The function predict_house_price requires all four parameters: area, rooms, year, and location. So I'll need to call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to check lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity and county. The user provided both, and the state defaults to California, which is correct here. So that's straightforward.\n\nLastly, the probability calculation. The user specified total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, and round to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, and round_to is optional with a default of 2. Since they want 3 decimals, I'll set round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. For the house price, all required fields are there. Lawsuit search has entity and county. Probability has the necessary numbers. So three function calls in total."}

The user has four separate requests here. First, they want to know the collectable fish in Animal Crossing during Summer. The function get_collectables_in_season requires game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item_type, so I'll use that.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in Fortnite on Playstation in Asia. The game_score.highest function needs game, platform, and region. The region here is Asia, so I'll include that.\n\nThen, they want lawsuit details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name and year, with case_type optional. Since they didn't specify a case type, I'll omit that.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All parameters are provided here.\n\nI need to make sure each function call has the correct parameters and types.
