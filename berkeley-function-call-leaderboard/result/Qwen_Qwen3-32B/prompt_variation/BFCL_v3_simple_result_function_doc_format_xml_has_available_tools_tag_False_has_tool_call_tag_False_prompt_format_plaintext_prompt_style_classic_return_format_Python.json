For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance.

The preferences are optional but can be used for specifying things like pet-friendly.\n\nLocation should be \"Manhattan, New York\". Room type is \"single\". Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023, which I should format as a string, maybe \"2023-03-10\". For preferences, since they want a pet-friendly hotel, I should include that in the preferences array.\n\nSo the function call would include all the required parameters and add \"pet friendly\" to the preferences. Let me make sure all required fields are there. Yes, location, room_type, duration, start_date are all present. The preferences are optional, so including them as an array with \"pet friendly\" should work."}
