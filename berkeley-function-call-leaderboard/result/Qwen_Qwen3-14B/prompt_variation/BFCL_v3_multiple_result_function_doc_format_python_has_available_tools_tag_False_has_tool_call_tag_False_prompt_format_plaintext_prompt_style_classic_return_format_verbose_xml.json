Let me check its parameters: initial_speed (int), acceleration (int), time (int), and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. All are integers, so that fits. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2, which is fine here. So I should call calculate_displacement with those values. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here since the question is about displacement, not final speed. No missing parameters, so the function call is straightforward."}

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions. There's calculate_acceleration which takes initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But we don't know the acceleration or the final speed here. Wait, but the user is asking for the final speed. So maybe that function isn't directly helpful unless we can find acceleration first.\n\nThen there's calculate_speed_from_rest. The description says it calculates speed starting from rest with constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). Wait, but how does that work? Because normally, if you have distance, time, and initial speed, you can calculate average speed, but with constant acceleration, maybe they're using a specific formula here.\n\nWait, the function calculate_speed_from_rest might be using the formula for final velocity when starting from rest. Let me think. If an object starts from rest (initial velocity u=0) and accelerates uniformly, the distance traveled is s = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2. Also, final velocity v = a * t. So combining these, v = (2s)/t. Because substituting a = 2s/t\u00b2 into v = a*t gives v = 2s/t. \n\nSo if the function calculate_speed_from_rest uses that formula, then given distance and time, it can compute the final speed. Let me check the parameters. The function requires distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). Since the user says it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So the parameters would be distance=20, time=4. \n\nBut wait, the function's name is calculate_speed_from_rest. Maybe it's designed for that exact scenario. So calling that function with distance=20 and time=4 should give the final speed. Let me check if the parameters are correct. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds. So those are integers, which fits. So the function call would be to calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. \n\nAlternatively, if that function isn't available, maybe we need to calculate acceleration first using calculate_acceleration. But in that case, we need initial_speed, final_speed, time, or distance. But since we don't know final_speed, that might not be possible. So the calculate_speed_from_rest function seems more appropriate here. \n\nSo the correct function to call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default, which matches the problem's condition of starting from rest."}
