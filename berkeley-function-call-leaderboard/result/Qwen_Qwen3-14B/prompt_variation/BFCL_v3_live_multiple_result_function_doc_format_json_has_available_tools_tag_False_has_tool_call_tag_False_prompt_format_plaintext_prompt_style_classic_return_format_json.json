The user wants an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nFor uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be a street address with city, state. The user provided that exact address. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes. So that fits.\n\nThen there's uber.ride2. It requires loc (city, state), type, and time. The user's loc is a street address, but ride2's loc example is 'Berkeley, CA' without the street. The user's input has the full address, so maybe ride2 isn't suitable here because it's expecting a city and state, not a street address. Also, ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, so that's okay. But since the loc format doesn't match, ride2 might not be the right choice.\n\nSo the correct function is uber.ride with the parameters loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. I should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The user mentioned 'Plus' but the enum in the function uses lowercase 'plus', so need to use the correct case. Also, check if time is an integer. Yes, 10 is an integer. All required parameters are present. So the function call should be uber.ride with those parameters."}

It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date.\n\nThe user gave all the necessary parameters: bank name is U.S. Bank, account number is 1-523-1713-5704, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction details include total deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40, start date 2019-10-01, end date 2019-10-31. The beginning and ending balances are provided, but the BankStatementOverView doesn't require those, so maybe they're extra. \n\nWait, the function parameters for BankStatementOverView don't include starting or ending balances, just the transaction overview. So I can use the given data to fill in the transaction_overview. The user also mentioned including a summary of transactions, which might be handled by the transaction_summary.generate function. But the question is to provide an overview, which the BankStatementOverView function is designed for. \n\nI should call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters.

The other parameters like starting and ending balances aren't needed here. \n\nSo the function call would be BankStatementOverView with the parameters as specified. I don't need to use other functions like TransactionsV2 or Alltransactions because the user isn't asking to process individual transactions or retrieve all transactions, just an overview. The transaction_summary.generate might be for generating a detailed summary, but the user's request seems to align with BankStatementOverView. \n\nI think that's the correct function to use here. Let me make sure all required parameters are present. Yes, bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview are all provided by the user.

However, the instructions say to make function calls if possible, else point out missing parameters. Since the category is required and not provided, the assistant should note that. But the user's original question didn't mention a category. Therefore, the correct action is to point out that the category is missing. However, looking back at the function definition, the 'category' is required. So the assistant can't call the function without it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the category is missing. But the user might not have provided it. So the assistant should respond that the category is required. However, the user's query is about finding restaurants with certain price and seating, not specifying cuisine. Therefore, the assistant needs to inform the user that the category is required. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. So in this case, the function call can't be made because 'category' is missing. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the 'category' parameter is missing. However, maybe the user intended to leave it out, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is required. But the user's message didn't mention it. So the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default category, but the function doesn't have a default. Therefore, the answer is that the required parameter 'category' is missing."}

Therefore, the correct response is to note that the required parameters (location, place_name) are missing. However, looking back at the function parameters for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel, 'location' is required, and 'place_name' is optional with a default of 'dontcare'. Wait, no: checking the parameters again, the required fields are 'place_name', 'check_in_date', 'stay_length', 'location'.

The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. The event_type can be set to \"Music\" and \"Theater\" separately, but the function allows only one event_type at a time. Wait, the user wants both concerts and plays. Hmm, maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. But the function's parameters have event_type as a single string, not a list.

Alternatively, maybe the function can accept multiple types, but according to the parameters, it's a single string. So I might need to make two separate calls. However, the user might be okay with either, so maybe the function can be called once with event_type as \"Music\" and then again with \"Theater\". But the user's question is to find what events are happening, so maybe the function can handle both if there's a way. Wait, the enum for event_type is ['Music', 'Theater'], so each call can only handle one type. Therefore, to cover both, two separate calls are needed. However, the user might not mind if the system checks both. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a list, but according to the parameters, it's a single string.

However, the user's question is to find events like concerts or plays, so combining both types. But the function can't handle both in one call.

Alternatively, maybe the system can handle it in one call by using a broader term, but according to the parameters, it's restricted to the enum. So the answer would be two function calls.

Alternatively, maybe the function can accept \"Music\" and \"Theater\" as separate parameters, but the parameters show that event_type is a single string.

The available functions are Buses_3_FindBus, Buses_3_BuyBusTicket, Hotels_4_ReserveHotel, and Hotels_4_SearchHotel. Since the user wants to find an itinerary, the Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice here. The other functions are for buying tickets or hotel reservations, which aren't needed yet.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Buses_3_FindBus: required are from_city, to_city, and departure_date. The user provided all three: from_city is Fresno, CA, to_city is Los Angeles, CA (though they didn't specify the state, but the example shows 'Los Angeles, CA', so I'll assume that), and departure_date is March 10th, 2023. The date format needs to be MM/DD/YYYY, so that's 03/10/2023.\n\nThe user also mentioned traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1. The default for category is 'direct', which is fine unless they specified otherwise. They didn't mention anything about the route category, so using the default is okay.\n\nSo the function call should include from_city: 'Fresno, CA', to_city: 'Los Angeles, CA', departure_date: '03/10/2023', num_passengers: 1. The category can be left as default. I need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted and that the required fields are present.

They want to book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA on May 15, 2023, starting at one day before, and include trip protection.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function is for reserving tickets, which seems necessary here. The parameters required are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, and trip_protection. Also, there's an optional _class parameter with enum values.\n\nThe user mentioned \"one day before\" the journey. The date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, so the journey_start_time should be May 14, 2023. Wait, but the date_of_journey parameter is for the journey date. Wait, the user says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before.\" That might mean the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before? That's confusing. Wait, maybe the journey is on May 15, but the start time is the previous day? Or perhaps the user meant the journey is on May 15, and they want the tickets for that date, but the start time is one day before? Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the journey is on May 15, and the start time is the same day, but the user wants to book for the day before? Not sure. Wait, the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets require date_of_journey and journey_start_time. The date_of_journey is the date of the journey, and journey_start_time is the time on that date. So if the user says \"starting at one day before,\" perhaps they mean the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the journey to be on May 15, but the start time is the previous day's time? That's unclear. Maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15, and they want to book tickets for that date, with the journey starting at a time on May 15. But the mention of \"one day before\" might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the journey to start on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. That's conflicting. This part is a bit ambiguous. However, given the parameters, the date_of_journey is required, and the journey_start_time is the time on that date. So if the user says \"starting at one day before,\" maybe they meant the journey is on May 15, but the start time is the previous day's time, which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the user intended the journey to be on May 14, but wrote May 15. Alternatively, maybe they want the journey on May 15, and the start time is, say, 8:00 AM, but the \"one day before\" is a mistake. Since the user's instruction is unclear, but the function requires date_of_journey and journey_start_time, I'll proceed with the given date, assuming that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is a specific time on that day. However, the user didn't specify the time, so maybe the journey_start_time is optional? Wait, looking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets, the required parameters include journey_start_time. So the user must provide that. But the user hasn't given a specific time. This is a problem. The user's request lacks the journey_start_time parameter. Therefore, I can't proceed without that. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as a time on that day, but they didn't specify. Since the user didn't mention the time, perhaps I should assume a default or ask for clarification. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user might have made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date_of_journey being May 14, but the user wrote May 15. This is confusing. Let me re-express the user's question: \"book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". The phrase \"starting at one day before\" might mean the journey starts on May 14, but the user wrote May 15. Alternatively, it could be a typo. Given that, perhaps the correct date_of_journey is May 14, 2023. But the user says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". This is unclear. However, since the function requires date_of_journey and journey_start_time, and the user hasn't provided the journey_start_time, I need to note that. But the user might have intended to provide the journey_start_time as a time on May 15, but didn't specify. Therefore, the parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to use the date_of_journey as May 15 and the journey_start_time as a specific time, but since it's not given, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the journey_start_time is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date_of_journey being May 14, but the user wrote May 15. This is a possible error. However, without more information, I can't assume that. Therefore, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (True), and date_of_journey (May 15, 2023). But journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called because journey_start_time is required. So the answer should point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide that, but it's not in the question. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the journey_start_time is missing."}

But the user might need to use both functions? But the user is asking for all tokens, so perhaps the second function is the one that gets all tokens, but the parameters don't include user_id. However, the user's user ID is 12345, but the function doesn't take that. So maybe the second function is the right one, and the user's user ID is not needed because it's already authenticated. \n\nBut the user is providing the user ID, which might be necessary for the first function. However, the second function doesn't require it. So perhaps the correct approach is to call the second function with include_expired=True to get all tokens, including expired ones. But the user might not have access to that function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first function is for shareable tokens, and the second is for all tokens. But the user wants all, so the second function is needed. However, the second function's parameters don't include user_id, but the user provided it. But the function doesn't require it. So maybe the user's user ID is not needed here. \n\nIn that case, the correct function to call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True to get all tokens, including expired ones. But the user might also need to include revoked tokens, but the second function doesn't have an include_revoked parameter. The first function has include_revoked, but it's for shareable tokens. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. The user wants all tokens, so maybe the best approach is to call both functions. First, use the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get shareable tokens, including revoked ones. Then use the second function with include_expired=True to get all tokens, including expired. But the user might not need to do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function is the correct one, and the user's user ID is not needed because it's already part of the authentication. So the answer would be to call api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user provided the user ID, which isn't used in that function. \n\nBut the user might not have access to that function. The functions available are CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The user wants all tokens, so perhaps the second function is the right one. But the parameters don't include user_id. So maybe the user's user ID is not needed here. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's user ID is provided, but the second function doesn't require it. So the correct function to call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True to get all tokens, including expired ones. However, the user might also need to call the first function with include_revoked=True to get shareable tokens, including revoked ones. But the user's request is for all tokens, so maybe the second function is sufficient. \n\nBut the first function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens, which might be a subset. The second function's description says it retrieves API tokens associated with the user's account. So perhaps the second function is the correct one. Therefore, the function call would be to api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user's user ID is 12345, but the function doesn't take that parameter. So the answer is to call that function with include_expired=True."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' which requires parameters like experience_or_education_type and experience_or_education_name. The enum for experience_or_education_type includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', which matches the user's query. \n\nSo, I should call that function. The parameters needed are experience_or_education_type set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and experience_or_education_name, which the user didn't specify, but the default is 'Not specified'. Since the user didn't mention a specific name, maybe it's okay to leave it as default. But wait, the function's required parameters are experience_or_education_type, which is provided, and experience_or_education_name is optional with a default. So the call should work."}
{"id": "live_multiple_1051-278-0", "result": "[{\"function\":\"set_alarm\",\"parameters\":{\"alarm_time\":\"2023-12-01 07:00:00\",\"purpose\":\"wake up for meeting\"}}]", "input_token_count": 784, "output_token_count": 589, "latency": 14.873502492904663, "reasoning_content": "Okay, the user wants to set a reminder for 7:00 AM tomorrow, December 1st, 2023, to wake up early for a meeting. Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe functions available are set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for an alarm at a specific time, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for a duration, which doesn't fit here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for set_alarm, the required parameter is alarm_time. The user specified \"7:00 AM\" and the date is tomorrow, which is 2023-12-01. So the alarm_time should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or a similar standard format. The user mentioned \"7:00 AM\", so combining the date and time, it would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. The purpose is \"wake up for a meeting\", but the default is 'reminder', so maybe the user can specify the purpose as 'meeting' or 'wake up for meeting'.\n\nWait, the user's message says \"Can you set a reminder for 7:00 AM?\" So the purpose might be 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The parameters for set_alarm have a purpose parameter with a default of 'reminder'. The user's request includes the purpose as waking up for a meeting, so maybe the purpose should be 'wake up for meeting' or just 'meeting'.\n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'wake up for meeting'. Alternatively, since the date is tomorrow, maybe the user intended the alarm to be on the next day, but they specified the date as 2023-12-01, which is correct. The function allows the date in the alarm_time parameter.\n\nI need to make sure the date is correctly formatted. The user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which is probably a typo for \"tomorrow\". But the date given is 2023-12-01, which is correct. So the alarm_time is '2023-12-01 07:00:00'.\n\nSo the parameters are alarm_time: '2023-12-01 07:00:00', purpose: 'wake up for meeting'. The function call should be set_alarm with those parameters."}
