We have to use our knowledge to infer the work title.\n\n Since the function requires the work_title, we can use:\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" OR a common known title? But note the function expects the title.\n\n However, the function does not specify if it accepts common names. We have to try the most accurate title.\n\n Alternatively, we might use the common English title: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\", but the original is in Latin.\n\n But note: the function does not specify language. We can try either, but let's try the most common known title.\n\n However, the function description does not specify how the title should be. We have to make a best guess.\n\n Since the function is designed to find the publication year, it might be able to handle common titles.\n\n But to be safe, we can try the Latin title, as it is the original and most cited.\n\n Let's use:\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n The function also has an optional parameter 'location' with default 'all'.

But the current turn only allows one function call? Actually, the instruction says we can output multiple function calls in the same <TOOLCALL> block? But the example format shows multiple functions in the same block.\n\n However, the problem says: \"at each turn\" we should try to complete the task. And we can output until we have fulfilled the request.\n\n But note: we don't have multiple functions to try in one go? We have only one function. And we don't know if the function can handle variations.\n\n Alternatively, we might try one and if it fails, then in the next turn we can adjust.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n But in the current turn, we can only output one function call? Because we don't have a way to try multiple titles without knowing the response.\n\n Since we are only allowed to output the tool call in the <TOOLCALL> block and nothing else, we have to make one call.\n\n We'll use the full Latin title.\n\n So the tool call will be:\n\n <TOOLCALL>publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\")</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note: the function parameters are required: author and work_title.

But that would be a subsequent step.\n\n For now, we output the call.\n\n Important: The function call must be exactly in the format: function_name(param1=value1, param2=value2)\n\n We must use double quotes for string values? The example in the function definition is in Python syntax, so we use double quotes.\n\n However, note the work title has non-ASCII characters (like \u00e6). We must represent it correctly. But the system should handle Unicode.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the common English title? But let's stick to the original.\n\n Let's write the call:\n\n   publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\")\n\n But note: the author's name is \"Isaac Newton\" or \"Isaac Newton\"? The question says \"Isaac Newton\", so we use \"Isaac Newton\".\n\n Correction: \"Isaac Newton\"\n\n So:\n\n   publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\")\n\n However, the function might not have an entry for the full Latin title? We don't know. We are making an educated guess.\n\n Alternatively, we might use the common abbreviation \"Principia\".
