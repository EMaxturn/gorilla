The question is about displacement, so the first function is the right choice. \n\nLooking at the parameters required for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. All required parameters are present. The rounding parameter is optional, but since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default of 2. \n\nSo, I should call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No other parameters needed. The other function is for final speed, which isn't required here. \n\nI need to make sure there are no missing parameters. All required ones are there.

The game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.

The formula for speed when starting from rest is probably the one that relates initial velocity, acceleration, and time. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which requires distance, time, and initial_speed. The parameters for that function are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (integer). The user provided all the necessary parameters: distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds, and since it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. \n\nSo I should call the 'calculate_speed_from_rest' function with those values. The other function, 'calculate_acceleration', might be for when they have initial speed, final speed, time, and distance, but the question is about speed, not acceleration.

The user didn't mention the height, but the wall is 30x12, so maybe the height is 1 foot? Or maybe the height is the same as the length or width? The problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet, so maybe the height is 1 foot. But the function parameters require length, height, and coverage_rate.
