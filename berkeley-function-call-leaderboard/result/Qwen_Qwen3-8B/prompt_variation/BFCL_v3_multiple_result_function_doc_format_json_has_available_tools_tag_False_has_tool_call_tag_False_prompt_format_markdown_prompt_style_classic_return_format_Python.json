The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics functions provided.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters given in the question are all there: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2. \n\nI don't need to use the 'calculate_final_speed' here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct function to call is 'kinematics.calculate_displacement' with the provided parameters. Let me make sure all required parameters are included. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, and time are all provided. Rounding is optional, so omitting it will use the default. \n\nSo the function call should be calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified the US, I don't need to adjust the region. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. But wait, does the function check sales or just the regular price? The description says \"selling price,\" which might include sales. However, the user mentioned \"cheapest,\" so maybe I should check if it's on sale. \n\nThere's also the video_games.on_sale function to check if the game is on sale. If it is, the store_price might return the sale price. But the user wants the cheapest, so perhaps I need to check both. However, the functions available don't have a way to compare prices over time or different sales. The store_price function might return the current price, which could be the lowest available. Alternatively, if the game is on sale, the store_price would return the discounted price. \n\nSo, maybe I should first check if it's on sale using on_sale, and then get the price. But the user's question is straightforward: they want the current selling price, which could be the cheapest. The store_price function is the direct way to get the price. The on_sale function would just confirm if there's a sale, but the price would already be the sale price if applicable. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is video_games.store_price with the game_title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. That should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available unless there's a sale, but the function might already account for that. Since the user didn't mention checking sales specifically, the store_price is the right choice."}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the physics formulas involved. Since the object starts from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem mentions constant acceleration, so maybe I should use the equations of motion. The relevant formula here might be the one that relates distance, time, initial speed, and final speed. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the final speed. The function provided is called 'calculate_speed_from_rest', which seems perfect because it's for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The parameters required are distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. Since initial_speed defaults to 0, I don't need to include it unless specified. \n\nSo, the function call should be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is already 0 by default. That should give the final speed. I don't need the other function because this one directly addresses the scenario of starting from rest. Let me make sure there are no missing parameters. The required parameters are distance and time, which are both provided. Alright, that's all."}

The function provided is calculate_final_temperature, which requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. \n\nSo the parameters here would be quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. Since the gas is the same, there's no need to adjust for different molar masses or anything else. The function should handle this by calculating the weighted average based on the quantities. \n\nWait, does the function assume that the quantities are in the same units? The problem states they're both in moles, so that's consistent. The temperatures are in Kelvin, which is correct. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters here. All required fields are provided.

So desired_sum is 7, sides_per_die is 6, and n_rolls is 2. Wait, the parameters for the function: required are desired_sum and sides_per_die. N_rolls is optional. So I need to include desired_sum=7 and sides_per_die=6. The n_rolls is 2, but since the function's default for n_rolls is 1, I need to specify it as 2. Let me make sure.

There's the finance.calculate_future_value function. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are initial_investment, rate_of_return, and years. The parameters provided by the user match these: initial_investment is 20000, rate_of_return is 8% (which I should convert to 0.08 as a float), and years is 5. There's also an optional contribution parameter, but the user didn't mention any additional contributions, so I can set that to 0 or omit it. \n\nWait, the function's parameters specify that rate_of_return is a float.

It requires location, art_form, and has parameters for month and user_ratings. The user mentioned \"top rated,\" which probably corresponds to the user_ratings parameter. The default for user_ratings is 'high', which matches the user's request. The location is New York, and the art_form is modern sculpture. The month is specified as upcoming, which is the default for the month parameter. So I should call find_exhibition with location='New York', art_form='modern sculpture', and user_ratings='high'. Wait, the art_form parameter in the function is just 'art_form' without specifying modern, but the user says modern sculpture. Maybe the art_form should be 'sculpture' and the month is upcoming. Wait, the function's parameters are location, art_form, month, and user_ratings. The user wants modern sculpture, so maybe art_form should be 'sculpture' and the month is the upcoming one. But the function's month parameter defaults to upcoming events. So the parameters would be location='New York', art_form='sculpture', month='upcoming', user_ratings='high'. Wait, but the user specified \"modern\" sculpture. Does the art_form parameter accept that? The description says \"form of art the exhibition is displaying, e.g., sculpture.\" So maybe the art_form should be 'modern sculpture' or 'sculpture'. The example uses 'sculpture', so perhaps the user's query should map to that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle 'modern sculpture' as the art_form. But since the example uses 'sculpture', maybe it's better to use that. However, the user specifically mentioned \"modern sculpture,\" so perhaps the art_form should be 'modern sculpture'. But I'm not sure if the function's art_form parameter can handle that. The function's parameters don't specify that it's limited to certain values, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, maybe the art_form is just the general type, and the modern aspect is covered by the month or another parameter. Hmm. The user's query says \"modern sculpture exhibition,\" so the art_form should be 'sculpture' and maybe the month is upcoming.

Also, user_ratings is set to 'high' as per the default. So the function call would be find_exhibition with location='New York', art_form='sculpture', month='upcoming', user_ratings='high'. Wait, but the user said \"modern sculpture,\" so maybe the art_form should be 'modern sculpture'. But the function's example uses 'sculpture', so perhaps the function can handle that. Alternatively, maybe the function's art_form parameter is for the type, and the modern aspect is part of the description. But since the function's parameters don't have a specific field for that, perhaps the best approach is to set art_form to 'sculpture' and rely on the month parameter for upcoming events. So the final function call would be find_exhibition with location='New York', art_form='sculpture', month='upcoming', user_ratings='high'."}
