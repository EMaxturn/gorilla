The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The required parameters are all provided here: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2 decimals. The user didn't specify rounding, so I'll use the default.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters match. The function expects integers for initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The given values are all integers. So the call should be calculate_displacement with those values. I don't need to use the final speed function here because displacement is the main goal.

The other functions like store_currency and on_sale don't seem necessary here since the question is specifically about the price. I should make sure to include all required parameters.

The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I need to call this function with those parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, so maybe that's already handled by the function. The required parameters are distance and time, which we have: 20 meters and 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. So using this function should give the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speed and time, but we don't have the final speed here. So that's not applicable here. \n\nSo the correct function to call is 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default. That should compute the final speed."}

Exactly the parameters needed here. The user provided all required values: 2 moles and 300 K for the first, 3 moles and 400 K for the second. So I can call that function directly with these values.
