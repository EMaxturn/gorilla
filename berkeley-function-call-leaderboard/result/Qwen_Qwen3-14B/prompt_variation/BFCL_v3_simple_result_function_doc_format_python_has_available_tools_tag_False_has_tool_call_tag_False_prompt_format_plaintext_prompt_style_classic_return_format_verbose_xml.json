The function's default for returnAllPossibleKeys is false, and assumeMajor is true by default.\n\nSo, the task is to identify the key signature for this chord progression. The progression given is I, V, vi, IV. Let me think about chord progressions. In a major key, the I is the tonic, V is the dominant, vi is the relative minor, and IV is the subdominant. That's a common progression in major keys, like C major: C, G, Am, F. So the key would be C major here. But wait, the vi chord in a major key is the relative minor. So if the progression includes vi, that's possible in both major and minor keys. However, the default assumeMajor is true, so the function would check for major keys first. \n\nIf assumeMajor is true, the function would look for a major key that fits the progression. The presence of IV (subdominant) and V (dominant) suggests a major key. The vi chord in a major key is the relative minor, so that's acceptable. So the key would be the major key corresponding to the I chord. Since the progression starts with I, the key is the same as the I chord's root. So if the I is C, the key is C major. \n\nBut the function's job is to determine that. The user's function call is correct as is, with the given parameters. They didn't specify returnAllPossibleKeys, so it will return the first valid key, which in this case is likely the major key. So the function call is properly formed. No missing parameters. The progression is provided, and the other parameters use their defaults. So the answer is the function call as given."}
