The loc format is 'Street Address, City, State', which the user provided. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes. So uber.ride seems suitable.\n\nThe second function, uber.ride2, also requires loc and type, but the loc format is 'City, State', but the user gave a full address. Also, time is optional with a default of 10. But since the user specified 10 minutes, maybe it's okay. However, the first function's loc matches the user's input better. So I should use uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. The parameters are all present, so the call is valid."}

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include searching archival memory and recall memory. Since the user didn't provide the birthday info, I should check the archival memory first. Use archival_memory_search with the query \"Shishir Patil birthday\" to see if there's any stored info.\n\nIf that doesn't return the birthday, maybe check recall memory using recall_memory_search with the same query. But the user might not have a conversation history, so archival is more likely. If I can't find the birthday, I can't proceed. But assuming the search finds it, then I can use send_message to congratulate him. The recipient would need an email or phone number, but the user didn't specify. Maybe use a default recipient or ask for it. Wait, the send_message function has a default recipient of 'default@example.com', but that's probably a placeholder. However, the user didn't provide Shishir's contact info, so I might need to inform them that I can't send the message without the recipient details. Alternatively, if the user expects me to have that info in memory, check core memory's human section. But since the user hasn't provided that yet, I might need to ask for the recipient's details. But the original question didn't include that, so maybe the user expects me to know it. Hmm, this is a problem. Without the recipient's info, I can't send the message. So I should first check if the birthday is in memory, then inform the user that I need the recipient's details to send the message. But the user's instruction says to send the message, so maybe they assume the recipient is known. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake. But according to the task, if parameters are missing, I should point it out. So, first, search for the birthday, then check if recipient info is available. If not, mention that the recipient's details are needed. But the user hasn't provided that, so the function call for send_message would require the recipient parameter. Since it's not given, I can't proceed. Therefore, the answer would be to first search for the birthday and then note the missing recipient info. But the user's question is to both find the birthday and send the message. So, the steps are: 1. Search archival memory for Shishir Patil's birthday. 2. If found, check if recipient info is available. 3. If not, inform the user that recipient details are needed. However, the user might have expected that the recipient is known, but since it's not provided, the function can't be called.

They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can be used. The BankStatementOverView function seems right. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user mentioned \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\" as the account name, so account_type is checking. The bank name is U.S. Bank. Account number is given. Full name might be the company name, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the user might be the account holder, but they didn't provide their name. Hmm, maybe the full_name is the company name? Or maybe I need to use another function to get the customer's name. Wait, the user didn't provide their name, but the function requires full_name. That's a problem. \n\nWait, the user might be the business owner, but they didn't give their name. The question is, do I have enough info? The parameters for BankStatementOverView require full_name. Since the user didn't provide it, maybe I can't proceed. But maybe the full_name is the company name? The account is under \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING,\" but that's the account name, not necessarily the company name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the full_name is the company name. But the function's description says \"the complete name of the account holder as recorded by the bank.\" If the account is under a company, then the full_name would be the company's name. However, the user hasn't provided that. Wait, the user might have provided the company name in the account name? Not sure. \n\nWait, the user's message says the account is under the name \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING.\" That might be the account type or name, not the company. So the full_name is missing. But the user hasn't provided it. So maybe I need to use the collect_customer_names function to get the customer's name? But the user hasn't provided first or last name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the full_name is not required, but according to the function parameters, it's required. So this is a problem. The user hasn't provided the full name of the account holder. Therefore, the BankStatementOverView function can't be called without that. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is the account holder and their name is implied? But the user hasn't given their name. So perhaps the answer is that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name. Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView's full_name is \"the complete name of the account holder as recorded by the bank.\" If the account is under a company, then the full_name would be the company's legal name. But the user hasn't provided that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the full_name is not needed, but according to the function's required parameters, it is. Therefore, the function can't be called without that information. However, the user might have provided the company name in the account name. Wait, the account name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING,\" which might be the account type, not the company name. \n\nThis is a problem. The required parameters for BankStatementOverView include full_name, which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, the function can't be called. But the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name. However, the user hasn't provided that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is the individual, and their name is not given. So the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer would be that the full_name is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the full_name is not required, but according to the function's parameters, it is. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the full_name is missing. However, the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is the business owner, and their name is not provided. Therefore, the function can't be called. \n\nBut the user also asked for a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. The user provided starting and ending balances, deposits, withdrawals, dates, but not the firstname and lastname. So that function also requires those. \n\nSo both functions require parameters that the user hasn't provided. Therefore, the answer would be that the necessary parameters are missing. But the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the full_name is the company name, even though it's not explicitly stated. For example, if the account is under the company \"Silver Business,\" then full_name would be that. But the user said the account is under the name \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING,\" which might be the account type. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, given the information provided, the required parameters for the BankStatementOverView function (full_name) and the transaction_summary.generate (firstname, lastname) are missing. Therefore, the functions can't be called. \n\nBut the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name, and the firstname and lastname are the business owner's name. However, without that info, the functions can't be called. \n\nSo the answer would be that the necessary parameters are missing. However, the user might have made a mistake in not providing those details. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the required parameters are missing."}

The user wants to integrate a new server into the MTNA RDS platform. They provided the hostname as http://plga.ca and the API key as '1234324'. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The relevant one here is add_mtnards_server. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are host and api_key. The host is the server's hostname or IP address. The user provided http://plga.ca, but I should check if the function expects just the hostname without the protocol. The example given in the parameters is 'localhost' or '192.168.1.10', which are just hostnames or IPs. So maybe the function expects the host parameter to be the hostname without the http://. However, the user provided the full URL. But maybe the function can handle that, or maybe it's better to extract just the domain. Wait, the user might have intended the host as plga.ca, but the input includes http://. Hmm. But the function's parameter description says \"the server's hostname or IP address\", so perhaps the host should be 'plga.ca' without the protocol. However, the user input is http://plga.ca. Should I use that as-is or strip the protocol? The function might expect just the hostname. But since the user provided it with http://, maybe they want it included. But according to the function's parameters, the host is supposed to be the hostname or IP. So maybe the correct approach is to use 'plga.ca' as the host. However, the user might have made a mistake in including the protocol. But since the user provided it that way, perhaps the function can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function expects the host as a URL. But the examples given in the parameters are 'localhost' or '192.168.1.10', which are not URLs. So I think the host should be 'plga.ca' without the http://. But the user input is http://plga.ca. Should I take that as the host? Or is that a mistake? Well, the user might have intended the host as http://plga.ca, but the function's parameters might not expect that. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the function's parameters specify that host is a string like 'localhost' or an IP. So perhaps the correct host is 'plga.ca', and the http:// is part of the URL, not the host. But the user might have included it by mistake. However, since the user provided it that way, maybe I should use it as-is. Alternatively, maybe the function expects the host without the protocol. But the user might not know that. Hmm. Well, the function's parameters don't mention anything about URLs, just hostnames or IPs. So I think the host should be 'plga.ca', and the http:// is part of the URL, not the host. Therefore, the host parameter should be 'plga.ca'. \n\nNext, the API key is given as '1234324', which is provided correctly. The function requires the api_key parameter. \n\nThe name parameter is optional and defaults to 'localhost'. The user didn't specify a name, so the default will be used. \n\nSo the function call should be add_mtnards_server with host='plga.ca' and api_key='1234324'. The name will default to 'localhost'. \n\nWait, but the user provided the host as http://plga.ca. If the function expects just the hostname, then using 'plga.ca' is correct. But if the function expects the full URL, then including http:// might be necessary. However, the examples given in the function's parameters are 'localhost' and IP addresses, which don't include protocols. Therefore, it's safer to use 'plga.ca' as the host. \n\nSo the correct function call is add_mtnards_server(host='plga.ca', api_key='1234324'). The name is optional and defaults to 'localhost', so it's not needed unless the user specifies it. The user didn't mention a name, so we can omit it."}

The required parameter is project_name, which the user provided as 'e-commerce-web'. \n\nSo the correct function call should be get_detail_adriel_project with project_name='e-commerce-web'. The other parameters can use their default values. I don't need to specify include_financials since it's optional and the user didn't ask for it. The date_format is set to default, which is 'YYYY-MM-DD', which should be fine unless the user specified otherwise, but they didn't. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters here. The project name is given, so the function should be called with that. No other functions are needed here because the other ones are for projects list, experiences, or education, which aren't relevant to this query."}

The include_tools parameter defaults to False, but the user might want tools included. Wait, the question says \"tech stack\" which usually includes tools, so maybe I should set include_tools to True. However, the default is False. But since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to just use the default unless told otherwise. Hmm, but the user might expect tools to be included. Let me check the function's parameters again. The include_tools is a boolean with default False. So if I don't include it, it'll be False. But the user might want all tech stack elements. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is to include languages and frameworks, and tools are optional. Since the user didn't specify, maybe just call the function with the employee_id as \"Adriel\" and leave the other parameters as default. The as_of_date is optional and defaults to current date if not provided. So the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id=\"Adriel\").

The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate priced, which I think corresponds to 'moderate' in the price_range enum. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the format needs to be 'City, State'. The user didn't specify the state, but since New York is a city, maybe the state is NY. So location would be 'New York, NY'. The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it as default or check if it's required. Wait, the required parameters are category and location. Oh, the user didn't mention a specific cuisine, so maybe I need to use a default category? Wait, the category is required, but the user didn't specify. Hmm, but the user's query doesn't mention a category. Maybe the function allows a default? Looking back, the parameters for FindRestaurants have 'category' as required, but the user hasn't provided one. Wait, the user's question is about price and seating, not cuisine. So maybe the category can be left as a default? Wait, no, the function requires 'category' to be specified. But the user hasn't given any info on that. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the user intended to search for any category, but the function requires a category. So perhaps I need to use a default or make an assumption. Wait, looking at the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the 'category' is required, and the enum includes options like Mexican, Bistro, etc. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I can't proceed without that. But the user's query doesn't mention a category. Wait, maybe the user is okay with any category as long as the price and seating are met. But the function requires a category. So perhaps the user's request is incomplete. However, the user might not know the categories, so maybe the assistant should proceed with a default or a general category. Wait, but the function doesn't have a default for category. The required parameters are category and location. So without the category, the function can't be called. But the user hasn't provided it. So this is an issue. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, but the assistant has to work with what's given. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a wildcard or a general term. But according to the function's parameters, category is required and must be one of the enum values. So perhaps the assistant can't proceed without that information. However, the user's query doesn't mention a category. So maybe the assistant should inform the user that the category is required. But according to the task instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But the user hasn't provided the category. Wait, the user's original question is: \"I want to find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York\". So the user didn't specify a category. Therefore, the assistant needs to call the FindRestaurants function, but the category is required. So this is a missing parameter. But the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the correct response would be to point out that the category is missing. However, maybe the assistant can use a default value. Wait, looking back at the parameters for FindRestaurants, the 'category' is required, and there's no default specified. So the assistant can't call the function without it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the category is missing. But the user might not know the category, so maybe the assistant should ask for clarification. However, according to the task instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. So in this case, the assistant should note that the 'category' parameter is required but not provided. However, the user might have intended to search across all categories, but the function doesn't allow that. Therefore, the correct action is to inform the user that the category is missing. But the task says to return the function calls if possible, else point it out. So in this case, since the category is required and not provided, the assistant should point out that the parameters are missing. But the user's question didn't mention a category. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed with the function call. So the answer would be that the 'category' parameter is missing. However, maybe the assistant can use a default category. Wait, looking at the parameters again, the 'category' is required, and there's no default. So the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the 'category' is missing. But the user might not have provided it. So the assistant should point out that the required parameter 'category' is missing. However, the user's original question didn't mention a category. Therefore, the assistant can't make the function call without that information. So the answer is to point out that the 'category' parameter is missing."}

Wait, the user's message says \"my landlord's email\", but doesn't give the actual email address. So the parameters required for the function include 'receiver', which is a string like an email or account number. Since the user hasn't provided the actual email address, this is missing.

However, the user's question says \"to my landlord's email\", but the actual email address isn't given. So the assistant should respond that the receiver parameter is missing.

However, the user might have made a mistake in the question. But according to the given information, the assistant must proceed. Therefore, the answer would be that the receiver's email is not provided. However, the user's message says \"to my landlord's email\", which implies that the email is known, but perhaps in the context of the system, the landlord's email is stored.

Therefore, the assistant should respond that the receiver is not provided. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should return the function calls if possible, else point out the missing parameters. Therefore, the correct answer is to indicate that the receiver's email is missing. However, the user's message says \"to my landlord's email\", which might be a way of referring to the email, but without the actual address, the function can't be called.

The other parameters like artist and genre can be left as default ('dontcare').\n\nOnce I get the list of songs from the lookup, I can then use Music_3_PlayMedia to play one of them. But the user hasn't specified a particular track, so maybe after looking up, the system would select a track from the results. However, the current task is to make the function calls. So first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019'. Then, assuming that returns some tracks, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name from the lookup results. But since the user hasn't provided a specific track, maybe the first step is just to look up the songs. The user might need to select one, but according to the task, I need to make the function calls based on the question. The user's question is to \"hear a track from the album... or any song that came out in 2019.\" So perhaps the assistant should first look up the songs and then play one. But the user hasn't specified which track, so maybe the assistant needs to call LookupMusic first, then PlayMedia with the first result or something. However, the current turn is to make the function calls. Since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant can't call PlayMedia without knowing the track name. Therefore, the correct step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters to find the songs, and then in a subsequent step, use the results to play one. But the user's question is a single turn, so maybe the assistant should first call LookupMusic and then PlayMedia. However, the assistant can't know the track name yet. Wait, the user might be expecting the system to handle that automatically. But according to the available functions, the PlayMedia function requires the track title. So the assistant needs to first call LookupMusic to get the track names, then use that to call PlayMedia. But in the current setup, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So in this case, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019'. Then, once the lookup returns a list of tracks, the next step would be to call PlayMedia with one of those tracks. However, the user's question is a single request, so maybe the assistant should chain these calls. But according to the instructions, the assistant should make the function calls in the current turn. Since the user hasn't provided a track name, the assistant can't call PlayMedia directly. Therefore, the correct first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the specified parameters."}

But the user might have expected the assistant to handle relative dates. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the current date to calculate \"this Friday\". For example, if today is Wednesday, October 11, 2023, then this Friday is October 13. But since the current date isn't provided, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, the parameters are incomplete. However, the user might have made a mistake, but the assistant should proceed with the given info.

This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Maybe they meant the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before the original date? That doesn't make sense.

However, the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets require date_of_journey in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and journey_start_time in 'HH:MM' format. The user hasn't provided the start time, only the date. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is missing. However, the function requires journey_start_time as a mandatory parameter. Wait, looking back at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: the required parameters are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. So the journey_start_time is required. But the user hasn't provided that. So this is a problem. The user's question lacks the journey_start_time parameter. Therefore, I can't proceed without that. But maybe the user intended to say that the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is not specified. However, the function requires it. So in this case, the answer would be that the parameters are missing. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is, say, 08:00, but that's an assumption. However, the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. But the user might have made a mistake in their question. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the original date, but that's unclear. Without the journey_start_time, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the required parameter journey_start_time is missing."}

The district_name should be Chatuchak. The start_available_date needs to be set to 2024-03-22. Since they mentioned a good reputation, maybe the avg_rating should be set to a higher value, like 4.0 or above. But the parameters allow using null for unrated, but since they want a good reputation, specifying a higher average rating makes sense. However, the function's parameters don't have a direct 'reputation' field, so avg_rating is the closest. Also, service_id for cleaning services: looking at the enum, 1 is cleaning service. So service_id=1. Other parameters like has_quality_problem should be false to ensure they have no quality issues. Maybe also check if is_cleaning_home is true since they're looking for home cleaning. Wait, the user didn't specify if it's home, office, or condo. But since they mentioned \"cleaning service\" generally, maybe just setting service_id=1 is enough. Let me make sure. The service_id enum includes 1 for cleaning service. So that's correct. Also, the start_available_date should be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format. The user said March 22nd, 2024, so maybe set it to '2024-03-22 00:00:00' as the start. End_available_date can be null if they're available on that date.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the get_api_tokens function from api_token_api.APITokenApi. It requires user_id and has an optional include_expired parameter. Since the user didn't mention anything about expired tokens, the default is False. So I should call this function with user_id=\"user123\".\n\nThen there's get_shareable_api_tokens from CustomDashboardsApi, which also requires user_id. But the user didn't specify anything about shareable tokens or custom dashboards. The question is general about all API tokens, so maybe just the first function is needed.\n\nWait, the user might have tokens from both regular API tokens and shareable ones. But the first function is for API tokens associated with the user's account, and the second is for shareable ones related to custom dashboards. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should call both to cover all possibilities. However, the user might not have shareable tokens, but to be thorough, perhaps both functions should be called. But the user's question is about \"all the API tokens\", so maybe the first function is sufficient. The second function is for shareable ones, which might be a subset. But the user might not know the difference. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need both. But the first function's description says \"associated with the user's account\", which is more general. The second is specifically for custom dashboards. Since the user didn't mention custom dashboards, maybe just the first function is needed. But to be safe, maybe call both. However, the parameters for both require user_id, which is provided. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe get_api_tokens requires user_id (string) and include_expired (default False). The get_shareable_api_tokens also requires user_id (string) and include_expired (default False). Since the user didn't mention expired tokens, default is False for both. So, to retrieve all possible tokens, maybe call both functions. But the user might not have shareable tokens. However, the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, so perhaps both functions are needed. But the first function's description says \"Retrieves a list of API tokens associated with the user's account\", which might include all tokens, and the second is for shareable ones. Maybe the shareable ones are a separate category. So to cover all bases, call both functions with the user_id provided. But the user might not have shareable tokens, but it's better to check both.\n\nWait, but the user might not have any shareable tokens, but the functions will return what's available. So the correct approach is to call both functions to get all possible tokens. However, the user's question is about \"all the API tokens\", which might be covered by the first function. The second function is for shareable ones, which might be a subset. But the user might not know the difference. So perhaps the first function is sufficient. Alternatively, the user might need both. But the problem is that the user is asking to be reminded of all their API tokens, so maybe the first function is the main one. The second function is for shareable tokens related to custom dashboards, which might be a separate set. So to be thorough, call both functions. But the user might not have any shareable tokens, but the functions will return an empty list if none exist. So the answer would be to call both functions with user_id=\"user123\"."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name they provided is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the alert type is error rate with a 5% threshold, and notifications should go to admin@example.com and support@example.com.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The create_global_application_alert_config function seems right here. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. The alert_type has an enum, so it needs to be one of 'error_rate', 'response_time', or 'traffic_spike'. The user specified 'error rate', which matches 'error_rate' in the enum. The threshold is 5%, which as a float would be 0.05. The recipients are two emails, which should be an array. The enabled parameter is optional and defaults to True, so even if not provided, it's okay.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention enabling or disabling the alert, so we can leave enabled as default. So the parameters would be name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05, recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. That should cover all required parameters. The other functions like enable_global_application_alert_config require an id, which the user hasn't provided, so that's not needed here. The mobile app function is for mobile apps, which isn't the case here. So the correct function call is create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters."}

The user is asking for all their API tokens and provided their user ID, which is 12345. I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there are two functions that retrieve API tokens: CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The first one requires a user_id parameter, which the user provided. The second one doesn't have a required parameter, but it's possible that it might need some other parameters like page or page_size. \n\nThe user said \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!!\", so they probably want all tokens without any pagination. The first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, has a parameter include_revoked which defaults to False. But the user didn't mention anything about revoked tokens, so maybe we should just get the default. However, the second function, get_api_tokens, has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. Since the user wants all tokens, maybe setting page_size to the maximum allowed (100) would get more tokens in one call. But if there are more than 100, they might need multiple pages. However, the user might not know about pagination, so perhaps using the first function is better since it's specifically for the user's account and requires the user_id. \n\nWait, the first function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens, while the second one is for all API tokens. The user might need all, so maybe the second function is more appropriate. But the second function doesn't require any parameters, so maybe it's a general list. However, the user provided their user ID, which might be needed for the first function. But the second function might not require it because it's part of the API's authentication. \n\nHmm, the user ID is provided, so using the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True might get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the default for include_revoked is False. The user didn't specify whether to include revoked, but they said \"ALL\", so maybe set include_revoked=True. However, the second function's include_expired parameter defaults to False, but again, the user might want expired ones too. \n\nWait, the first function is called get_shareable_api_tokens, which might be a subset of all tokens. The second function is get_api_tokens, which might be the complete list. Since the user wants all, maybe the second function is better. But the second function's parameters don't include user_id, which the user provided. That's confusing. Maybe the second function is part of an API that already knows the user's context, so the user_id isn't needed. \n\nIn that case, using the second function with include_expired=True, page=1, and page_size=100 would get as many as possible. But if there are more than 100, the user would need to make more calls. However, the user might not know about pagination. Alternatively, the first function requires user_id and might be more specific. \n\nBut the user provided the user ID, so maybe the first function is the right choice. Let me check the parameters again. The first function requires user_id, which is given, and include_revoked (default False). The user said \"ALL\", so maybe include_revoked=True. But the second function's include_expired is for expired tokens. \n\nI think the correct approach is to use the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens, including revoked ones. However, if the user wants all tokens regardless of being shareable, maybe the second function is needed. But since the user provided the user ID, and the first function requires it, that's a better fit. \n\nSo the function call would be CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True."}

The user wants to set a reminder for 7:00 AM tomorrow, December 1st, 2023, to wake up early for a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for an alarm at a specific time, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for durations, which doesn't fit here.\n\nThe parameters for set_alarm require alarm_time and optionally purpose. The alarm_time needs to be in a standard format. The user provided the date as 2023-12-1 and the time as 7:00 AM. Combining those, the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' in 24-hour format. Wait, but the user wrote 7:00 AM, which is 07:00 in 24-hour time. So the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' is correct here. The purpose is mentioned as waking up for a meeting, so I can include that in the purpose parameter.\n\nI need to make sure the date is correct. The user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Maybe that's a typo for \"tomorrow\". But the date given is December 1st, which is a specific date. Assuming that's correct, even if tomorrow is a different date, but the user specified the date, so we'll use that. So the alarm_time is '2023-12-01 07:00:00'.\n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time set to that string and purpose as 'wake up for meeting'. The default purpose is 'reminder', but the user specified the reason, so including it makes sense."}
