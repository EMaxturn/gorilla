For linear_regression_fit, I need to provide the actual arrays for x and y, but I don't have them yet; I need to get them from data_loading.\n\nThis is a problem.

This might be an issue because how does it know which recipe to modify? The description says: \"Replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute...\" but the parameters don't specify a recipe. Perhaps it's assumed that the function handles it internally, but that seems odd. In the available functions, it's listed as is. I have to go with what's given.

They specify: In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible royal flushes, and round to 3 decimal places.\n\nI need to use the available functions to handle these:\n\n- For modifying the painting: There's a function called 'modify_painting' which requires 'size' and 'medium'. 'dominant_color' is optional with a default.\n\n- For predicting the evolutionary rate: There's 'prediction.evolution' which requires 'species' and 'years', and 'model' which defaults to 'Darwin'.\n\n- For calculating probability: There's 'calculate_probability' which requires 'total_outcomes' and 'favorable_outcomes', and 'round_to' which defaults to 2, but they want 3.\n\nI should make function calls for each of these in sequence.

A standard poker hand is 5 cards from 52, so total_outcomes should be the number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52, which is C(52,5).\n\nThe function requires 'total_outcomes' as an integer, and they say \"in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\" So, favorable_outcomes: 4\n\nBut what is total_outcomes? For the probability of a royal flush in a 5-card hand, total_outcomes should be the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is C(52,5) = 2,598,960.\n\nThe user didn't explicitly say that, but from the description, it's implied. I need to use that value.\n\nSo, for 'calculate_probability':\n\n- total_outcomes: 2598960 (I'll calculate C(52,5) as 2,598,960)\n\n- favorable_outcomes: 4\n\n- round_to: 3\n\nI need to make these calls in my response.
