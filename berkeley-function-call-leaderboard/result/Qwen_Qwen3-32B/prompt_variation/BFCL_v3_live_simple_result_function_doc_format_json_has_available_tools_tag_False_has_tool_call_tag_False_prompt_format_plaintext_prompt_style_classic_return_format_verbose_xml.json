Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city and an optional date parameter. The city is provided as Marshall, MN, and the date is March 5th, 2023. The date needs to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. So I should format the date as 2023-03-05. The function's default date is 2019-03-01, but the user specified 2023. So I need to call the function with city=\"Marshall, MN\" and date=\"2023-03-05\". That should retrieve the correct forecast."}

The user wants to book a flight from JFK on March 16, 2024, around 14:00.\n\nFirst, I need to check the required parameters for the book_flight function. The required parameters are departure_location, departure_date, and departure_time. \n\nThe user provided the departure location as JFK, which is valid. The date is March 16, 2024. The function's note says the date must be after 14/03/2024. Since March 16 is after March 14, that's okay. The departure time is around 14:00. The function expects a time in 24-hour format, like '14:00'. \n\nSo all parameters are met. I should call the book_flight function with these details. The time is specified as 14:00, which is 2 PM. The date is 16/03/2024. \n\nWait, the date format in the function is 'dd/mm/yyyy', so March 16 would be '16/03/2024'. That's correct. \n\nNo missing parameters here. The user didn't mention the return date or destination, but the function doesn't require those. So the correct call is to book_flight with departure_location 'JFK', departure_date '16/03/2024', and departure_time '14:00'."}
