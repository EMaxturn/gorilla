They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be omitted.

The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should be a dictionary. The preferences include \"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", and \"milk\": \"almond milk\".

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory name might be the same as the repo name. Let's assume it's 'nodejs-welcome' unless specified otherwise. So, call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce we have the analysis, step 2.1 requires creating a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using the same directory name as before. But wait, the analysis might determine the programming language, which could influence the Dockerfile. However, the function doesn't take the language as a parameter, so maybe it's handled internally. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen step 2.2 is creating Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs directory_name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., aren't specified, so use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter creating these files, step 3 is adding all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name. The commit_message and branch_name are optional. The user didn't specify them, so maybe use defaults or omit. But the function's parameters don't have defaults for commit_message, so perhaps leave it out. However, the function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changes to Git\". The push_git_changes_to_github function's description mentions it will automatically git add all changes, so maybe that's covered. But the user might want to add them first. However, the function's parameters don't include a 'git add' step, so perhaps the function handles that internally. So proceed with the push function.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with the given URL.\n2. analyse_repo_contents on the directory.\n3. create_dockerfile and create_kubernetes_yaml_file using the directory name.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name.\n\nNow, check if all parameters are provided. The clone_repo has the URL. The other functions use the directory name, which is the repo's name. Assuming the cloned directory is named 'nodejs-welcome', that should work. If not, maybe the directory name is different, but the user didn't specify, so proceed with that assumption."}

The user is having a compilation error in their Java project. The class StringNumberHandler extends AbstractCellHandler and overrides methods like getCellValue, setCellValue, getExcelType, and getDefaultExcelFormat. The error is about the method getNumericValue() not being found in CellResult.\n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to CellResult, including subdirectories. The get_relevant_classes function seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to true. The search_string should be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The class_name is AbstractCellHandler, and include_private might be useful if the methods are private, but since they're overridden, maybe they're public. But the user might want to check, so including include_private as true could be safer. Wait, the parameters for get_signature include include_private, but the user didn't specify. However, since the methods are part of the class they're extending, it's possible they are public. But to be thorough, maybe set include_private to true to ensure no private methods are missed. Wait, no\u2014the include_private parameter in get_signature is for whether to include private methods' signatures. But the user is looking for the methods they are overriding, which are likely public. However, the user might want to make sure. But since the error is about getNumericValue() not being found, maybe the methods in AbstractCellHandler are using that method, which is missing in CellResult. So, checking the signatures of the overridden methods would help confirm their parameters and return types.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true to find related classes.\n2. Use get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue and getCellValue methods, including include_private as true to cover any possible private methods, though that's unlikely. But since the user is overriding, the methods in AbstractCellHandler should be public. However, the include_private parameter is optional, so maybe it's better to include it just in case. Wait, the parameter description says it's for including private methods' signatures. If the methods are public, including private might not affect it. But the user might want to ensure they're getting all possible methods. Alternatively, maybe the user is unsure if the methods are private. But in Java, overridden methods must have the same signature, so if the methods in AbstractCellHandler are private, they can't be overridden. So perhaps the include_private is not necessary here. But the function's parameter allows it, so maybe set it to false by default. Wait, the parameters for get_signature have include_private as required=false. So, the user didn't specify, so maybe we can omit it. But the user might want to check if the methods are private. However, since the user is overriding them, they must be accessible. So, perhaps it's safe to omit include_private. But to be safe, maybe include it as true. Hmm. The user's question is about ensuring they're overriding correctly, so getting the exact signature is important. If the methods in AbstractCellHandler are private, the user can't override them, which would cause an error. But the user is already getting a compilation error, so maybe that's part of the problem. But the current error is about getNumericValue() not being found. So, perhaps the methods in AbstractCellHandler are using getNumericValue(), which is missing in CellResult. So, the user needs to check the signatures of the methods they are overriding to see if they are using that method. Therefore, getting the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler would help confirm their parameters and return types, ensuring that the overridden methods in StringNumberHandler are correct.\n\nSo, the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true.\n\nThen, two calls to get_signature: one for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue and another for getCellValue, with include_private set to true to make sure.\n\nWait, but the parameters for get_signature include include_private as a boolean, but the user hasn't specified. However, the function's parameters have include_private as required=false, so it's optional. So, maybe it's better to include it as true to ensure that any private methods (though unlikely) are considered. But since the user is overriding methods, they should be public. However, the include_private parameter is for the method search, not the class. Wait, the get_signature function's include_private parameter is for whether to include private methods' signatures. But the method_name is required, so if the method is private, the user would have to know the name. But in this case, the user is looking for setCellValue and getCellValue, which are likely public. So, perhaps include_private can be omitted. But to be safe, maybe include it as true. However, the user might not need that. But since the function allows it, maybe it's better to include it. Alternatively, the user might not have specified, so the default is false. But the function's parameters don't specify a default. Wait, looking back, the parameters for get_signature have include_private as required=false, so it's optional. So, the user can choose to include it or not. Since the user is trying to ensure correct overriding, perhaps including include_private as true would be better to check all possible methods. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user should check the methods' access modifiers. However, the user's error is about getNumericValue() not being found, which might be a method in CellResult that's being called by the overridden methods. So, the user needs to check the signatures of the methods in AbstractCellHandler to see if they are using getNumericValue(), which is missing in CellResult. Therefore, getting the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler would help confirm their parameters and return types, ensuring that the overridden methods in StringNumberHandler are correct.\n\nSo, the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true.\n2. get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue with include_private true.\n3. get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's getCellValue with include_private true.\n\nBut wait, the user might not have specified include_private, but the function allows it. So, including it as true might be better to ensure that any private methods (though unlikely) are considered. However, if the methods are public, the include_private parameter might not affect the result. But since the user is trying to ensure correct overriding, it's better to get the exact signature, so including include_private as true could help. Alternatively, maybe the user should not include it, but the function's parameters don't have a default. So, perhaps it's better to omit it. But the function's parameters for get_signature have include_private as required=false, so it's optional. Therefore, the correct function calls would be:\n\nFirst, get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true.\n\nThen, two calls to get_signature: one for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue and another for getCellValue, without include_private unless specified. But the user might need to know if the methods are private. However, since the user is overriding them, they must be public. So, perhaps the include_private can be omitted. But the function allows it, so maybe it's better to include it as true to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, the user might not need it, but the function's parameters don't have a default. So, the correct approach is to call get_signature with the required parameters (class_name and method_name) and include_private if needed. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps it's better to omit it. But the user might want to check for private methods. However, in Java, you can't override a private method. So, if the methods in AbstractCellHandler are private, the user can't override them, which would cause a compilation error. But the user is already getting an error about getNumericValue(), so maybe that's a different issue. Therefore, the user needs to check the signatures of the methods they are overriding to ensure they match. So, the function calls would be:\n\nget_relevant_classes(\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True)\n\nget_signature(\"AbstractCellHandler\", \"setCellValue\")\n\nget_signature(\"AbstractCellHandler\", \"getCellValue\")\n\nBut the user might need to include include_private. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps it's better to omit it. But the function's parameters allow it. So, the answer would be to call those three functions."}

Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a comma-separated list, but the description doesn't mention that. The safest approach is to make two separate calls. \n\nBut the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if specified. However, given the function's parameters, it's better to make two separate calls. \n\nSo first, call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type=\"concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\". Then another call with event_type=\"play\", same city and date. \n\nWait, the city parameter in Events_3_FindEvents can be \"Los Angeles\" or \"Los Angeles, CA\"? The description says the city can be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. So using \"Los Angeles\" is acceptable. But to be safe, maybe use \"Los Angeles, CA\". \n\nAlso, the date is March 10th, 2023, which is \"2023-03-10\". \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\nEvents_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\")\n\nEvents_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"play\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\")\n\nThat should cover both concert and play events. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants both in one call, but since the function's event_type is a single string, it's not possible. So two separate calls are needed. \n\nI think that's the correct approach here. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly."}

They want two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment at 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider for searching stylists. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so I'll use that as the city. They didn't mention unisex, so maybe the is_unisex parameter can be omitted or set to 'dontcare'. But the function's parameters require is_unisex to be a boolean or 'dontcare'. Since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to leave it out or set it to 'dontcare' as a default. Wait, the function's parameters say is_unisex is required but marked as required=\"false\". Wait, checking the function definition again: <param name=\"is_unisex\" type=\"boolean\" required=\"false\">. So it's optional. So I can call FindProvider with city as 'Sunnyvale, CA' and not include is_unisex.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is needed. The parameters are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' as the stylist_name, time 15:00, and date 2023-05-10. All required parameters are present. So I can call BookAppointment with those values.\n\nSo two function calls are needed here. First FindProvider for Sunnyvale, CA, then BookAppointment with the given details."}
