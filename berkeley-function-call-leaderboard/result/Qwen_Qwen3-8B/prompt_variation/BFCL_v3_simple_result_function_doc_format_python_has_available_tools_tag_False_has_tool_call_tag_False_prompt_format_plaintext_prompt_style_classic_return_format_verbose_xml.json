I remember there's a function called calculate_final_velocity that does this. Let me check the parameters. The function requires height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height here is 150 meters. The initial velocity is given as zero, so I should set that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different value. Since the question doesn't mention any other gravity, I can use the default. So the function call should include height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Wait, the parameters are all integers except gravity, which is a float. So the parameters would be height as 150 (int), initial_velocity as 0 (int), and gravity as 9.81 (float). But since gravity is optional, maybe I can omit it. But the function's default is already 9.81, so including it explicitly isn't necessary. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I think that's all. So the function call should be calculate_final_velocity with height=150 and initial_velocity=0.

The user specified the user ID and the info to update. The database has a default value, so maybe it's not necessary to include unless they want a different one.\n\nThe update_info should be a dictionary.

So putting it all together, the function call should include user_id=43523 and update_info with the name and email.

Wait, how does the conditions parameter work? The description says it's a list of conditions. So maybe each condition is a dictionary or a string?\n\nLooking at the function's args: conditions is a list. So I should format each condition as a dictionary with the field, operator, and value. For example, for age > 25, it would be {\"field\": \"age\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": 25}. Similarly, for job = 'engineer', it's {\"field\": \"job\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}.\n\nSo the conditions list would contain both of these dictionaries.

Since they want two sixes in a row, I need to multiply the probability of each individual event. So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the functions provided, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters.

There's the investment.predictProfit function. Let me look at its parameters. It requires investment_amount (int), annual_return (float), and years (int). \n\nThe user provided all three: $5000 is the investment amount, 7% is the annual return, and 5 years. So I need to convert 7% into a decimal for the function. Wait, the function expects annual_return as a float. So 7% would be 0.07. \n\nWait, but maybe the function expects it as 7.0? The description says annual_return is a float, so 7.0 would be correct. Let me confirm. The user said 7%, so converting that to 0.07 is standard, but maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Wait, the function's parameter is annual_return (float), so if the user says 7%, the correct value would be 0.07. But sometimes, functions might expect the percentage as 7.0. Hmm, but the description says \"annual return rate\", which is typically a decimal. So 7% would be 0.07. However, maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Wait, the user input is 7%, so the function's annual_return is a float. Let me think. If the function is expecting a decimal, then 0.07 is correct. But if it's expecting a percentage like 7.0, then that's different. But the function's parameter is described as annual_return (float), so I should use 0.07. Wait, but maybe the function is designed to take the percentage as a whole number, like 7, and then internally converts it to 0.07. But the user's input is 7%, so the correct value would be 0.07. However, the function's parameter is a float, so either 7.0 or 0.07 would be acceptable. Wait, the user says annual return rate is 7%, which is 7% per year. So the correct value for annual_return would be 0.07. But maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the function's description again. The function's annual_return is described as \"annual return rate of the investment\", which is typically a decimal. So 7% would be 0.07. Therefore, the correct value is 0.07. \n\nSo the parameters would be investment_amount=5000 (int), annual_return=0.07 (float), years=5 (int). \n\nTherefore, the function call should be investment.predictProfit with those parameters. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

Does the function's start_date parameter represent the start of the date range? The description says \"date range\", but the example might be inclusive. However, the user wants lawsuits filed after that date. But the function's start_date is part of a date range. Wait, the function's start_date is the start of the range, but maybe the end is not specified. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after a certain date, maybe the start_date should be that date. But the function's parameters might not support end_date. So perhaps the function's start_date is the earliest date, and if the user wants after a date, setting start_date to that date would include all lawsuits from that date onwards. But the function's description says \"within a specific date range\", but the parameters only have start_date and location. Wait, looking back, the function's parameters are company, start_date, location, and status. Wait, maybe the date range is from start_date to end_date, but the function only has start_date. Wait, no, the function's parameters are company, start_date, location, and status. Wait, maybe the start_date is the start of the range, but the end is not specified. So perhaps the function is designed to take a start_date and maybe an end_date, but the parameters listed here don't include end_date. Wait, the function's parameters as given in the problem are company, start_date, location, and status. So the user's query is to search for lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021. So the start_date should be '01-01-2021', and maybe the end_date is not specified. But the function doesn't have an end_date parameter. So perhaps the function's start_date is the earliest date, and the end is not specified. Therefore, the user's query would be covered by setting start_date to '01-01-2021', and the function would return all lawsuits from that date onwards. \n\nSo the parameters would be company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', and status='ongoing'. Since status defaults to ongoing, maybe we can omit it. But the user's query is to find the function calls.

The user wants to book a single room at a pet friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required args are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. Preferences is optional.\n\nThe user specified \"single\" room, so room_type is 'single'. Location is \"Manhattan, New York\", but maybe I should check if the function expects a city name. The description says location is the city, but the user wrote \"near Manhattan, New York\". Hmm, maybe the function can handle that as a location string. \n\nDuration is 3 nights, so that's 3. Start_date is March 10th, 2023. The date format should be 'YYYY-MM-DD' probably. So March 10th would be '2023-03-10'.\n\nPreferences: the user mentioned pet friendly, so that should be included in the preferences list. The function's preferences parameter is a list, so I need to add 'pet friendly' there. Wait, the default is to use all if not specified, but the user has a specific preference here. So I should include that in the preferences list.\n\nPutting it all together: location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is 'single', duration is 3, start_date is '2023-03-10', and preferences is ['pet friendly'].\n\nWait, does the function's preferences accept a list of strings? The description says preferences is a list, so yes. So the function call should include all these parameters. Let me make sure all required parameters are present. Location, room_type, duration, start_date are all there. Preferences is optional but needed here. So the function call should be correct."}
