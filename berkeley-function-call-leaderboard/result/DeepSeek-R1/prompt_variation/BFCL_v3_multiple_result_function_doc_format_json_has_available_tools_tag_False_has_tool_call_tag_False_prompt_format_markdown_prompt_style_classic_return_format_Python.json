{"id": "multiple_25", "result": "[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]", "input_token_count": 707, "output_token_count": 1195, "latency": 54.45821261405945, "reasoning_content": "We are given a question: \"What is the cheapest selling price for the game 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' in the PlayStation Store in the United States?\"\n\nWe have three functions:\n1. video_games.store_currency: Fetches currency for a platform and region. Required: platform. Optional: region (with default).\n2. video_games.on_sale: Checks if a game is on sale. Required: game_title, platform. Optional: region (with default to US).\n3. video_games.store_price: Fetches the selling price. Required: game_title, platform. Optional: region (default to US).\n\nThe question asks for the cheapest selling price of a specific game in the PlayStation Store in the US.\n\nNote: The question does not specify any sale condition, but we are to get the selling price. Also, note that the question says \"cheapest\", but we are only checking one platform (PlayStation) and one region (US). So we are just getting the current price for that game in that store.\n\nHowever, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the selling price. Since we are only checking one platform and one region, the price we get from that function is the price we need.\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". If there are multiple editions or versions, we might need to compare? However, the function `video_games.store_price` might return the base game price. We don't have a function to list multiple editions. So we assume that the function returns the current selling price of the base game.\n\nSteps:\n1. We are to get the price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on PlayStation in the US.\n2. We can use `video_games.store_price` with the required parameters: game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', and region='United States'. Since region defaults to United States, we can omit it? But to be explicit, we can include it.\n\nHowever, note that the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region of United States. So if we omit region, it will default to United States. But the question specifies the United States, so we can either include it or omit it. We'll include it for clarity.\n\nSo we call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\nBut wait: the question asks for the \"cheapest\". However, we are only getting one price. Since we are only looking at one store (PlayStation Store in the US) and one game (by title), we assume the function returns the current price. If there are multiple editions, the function might return the base edition price? Or the cheapest edition? The function description doesn't specify. But since the question doesn't specify an edition, we assume the base game.\n\nAlternatively, the function might return the price of the game and if there is a sale, it returns the sale price? The function `video_games.store_price` should return the current selling price, which would be the discounted price if on sale. So we don't need to check the sale status separately.\n\nTherefore, we only need to call `video_games.store_price`.\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". What if the same game is available in different bundles or editions? We don't have a function to list all editions. So we assume the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for the standard edition or the only edition available? We have to rely on the function.\n\nAlternatively, the function might return the lowest price available for that game in that store? The description says: \"Fetches the selling price of a specified game\". It doesn't specify edition. So we assume it returns the base game price.\n\nGiven the above, we make the call.\n\nFunction call:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` has the parameter `region` with a default to United States. So we can also write without region. However, the question specifies United States, so including it is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if we are not sure about the region string, note that the function expects a string. The example regions are \"United States\", \"United Kingdom\", etc. So we use \"United States\".\n\nHowever, the function `video_games.store_currency` also uses the same region names? We don't need to call that for this question.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nBut wait: what if the game is on sale? The function `video_games.store_price` should return the current price, which if on sale would be the sale price. So we don't need to check the sale status separately.\n\nTherefore, we are making one function call.\n\nLet me double-check: the question asks for the cheapest selling price. We are only looking at one platform and one region. So the price we get is the only one we can get? Unless there are multiple stores? But the question specifies \"PlayStation Store\". So one store.\n\nThus, we call the function and return the call.\n\nOutput:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nBut note: the function parameters are required: game_title and platform. We are providing both and the optional region.\n\nWe are done for this turn."}

Apple pays quarterly, so we can set frequency to 'quarterly'. Alternatively, we could also return annually by default? \n\n However, the function's default is annually. But note: the question asks for \"payments\" (plural) which might imply every payment. So it is safer to get quarterly to capture every payment.\n\n But note: the function call must be made with the parameters. We are required to provide company and years.

The function doesn't specify, but typically dividend data per share is per payment. So if we use annually, it might aggregate? Or it might show the last dividend of the year? We don't know the exact behavior.)\n\n   Option 2: Explicitly set frequency to quarterly to get every dividend payment in the last five years.\n\n Considering the user's request: \"historical dividend payments\" (which are multiple events) and that Apple pays quarterly, we should get the quarterly data.\n\n Therefore, we set:\n   company = \"Apple Inc\"\n   years = 5\n   frequency = \"quarterly\"\n\n However, note: the function might not return 20 data points (5 years * 4 quarters) because it might not have data for the current quarter? But that's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, if we are not sure, we can also call without frequency and let it default to annually? But the user might want every payment.\n\n Since the function has the capability to get quarterly, and the question does not specify, we choose to get quarterly to be thorough.\n\n Therefore, the function call should be:\n\n   corporate_finance.dividend_data(company=\"Apple Inc\", years=5, frequency=\"quarterly\")\n\n But note: the function parameters are defined as:\n      required: ['company', 'years']\n      optional: frequency (with default)\n\n We are providing all required and one optional.\n\n However, note the company name: the user said \"Apple Inc\".

Here, it's \"New York, NY\" (as per example in description).\n   - art_form (required): The form of art. We are interested in \"sculpture\". But note the task says \"modern sculpture\". \n     However, the function does not have a parameter for era (like modern). But we can note that the art_form is sculpture.\n     Since the function doesn't have a parameter for modern, we might just use \"sculpture\" and hope the results are modern?\n     Alternatively, we might note that the function returns the most popular exhibitions and we are filtering by high ratings, so perhaps modern ones are included.\n   - month (optional): The month of exhibition. The task says \"upcoming month\". The description says default returns upcoming events. \n     So we can omit this or set to the upcoming month? The description says default returns upcoming events. So we can rely on default.\n   - user_ratings (optional): We want top rated, so we set to 'high'. The default is already 'high', so we can omit or set explicitly.\n\n Since the function requires:\n   - location: we'll set to \"New York, NY\"\n   - art_form: we'll set to \"sculpture\"\n\n However, note that the task says \"modern sculpture\". The function doesn't have a parameter for era. We might have to hope that the exhibitions returned include modern ones? \n But the function is about finding exhibitions, and we don't have a way to specify \"modern\". \n\n Since we cannot specify \"modern\" in the function, we have to use what we have. We'll call the function with:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"\n   user_ratings: 'high' (to ensure top rated) and since we want top rated.\n\n We are not providing month because the default returns upcoming events.\n\n Therefore, the function call should be:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n However, note that the function's description says the default for user_ratings is 'high'. So we could also omit it. \n But to be explicit about our intention, we can set it to \"high\".\n\n But wait: the task says \"top rated\", so we definitely want high ratings. So setting to \"high\" is appropriate.\n\n Let's write the function call accordingly."}
