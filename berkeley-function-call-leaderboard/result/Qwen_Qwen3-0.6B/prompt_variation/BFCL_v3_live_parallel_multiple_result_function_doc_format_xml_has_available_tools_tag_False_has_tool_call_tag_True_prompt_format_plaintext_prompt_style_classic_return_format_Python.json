The user wants to perform four steps: clone a repo, analyze its contents, create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML, and push changes. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst step is to clone the repo. The user provided the URL git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url, which they have, and destination is optional. Since they didn't specify a destination, I'll leave that out.\n\nNext, analyze the contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name. The user mentioned analyzing the contents, so I should call that function with the directory name. But wait, the repo is already cloned, so the directory is the same as the cloned repo. So I'll use the cloned directory name here.\n\nThen, create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML. The create_a_docker_file function is needed for the Dockerfile. The directory_name is the same as the cloned repo. For Kubernetes, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name. The user wants both, so I need to call both functions.\n\nAfter that, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function is needed here. The parameters are directory_name, which is the cloned repo, and maybe commit message, branch, etc. The user didn't specify commit message, so I'll leave those out. Force push is optional, so maybe not needed.\n\nWait, step 3 says to add all changed files. The push function does that by git add. So I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name. But the user didn't mention a commit message, so maybe just the directory_name is sufficient. The function's parameters include directory_name, so that's all.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps would be:\n\n1. <TOOLCALL>clone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\")</TOOLCALL>\n2. <TOOLCALL>analyse_repo_contents(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome.git\")</TOOLCALL>\n3. <TOOLCALL>create_a_docker_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome.git\")</TOOLCALL>\n4. <TOOLCALL>create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome.git\")</TOOLCALL>\n5. <TOOLCALL>push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome.git\")</TOOLCALL>\n\nWait, but step 2 is to analyse the contents. The directory_name is the same as the cloned repo. So the function call for analyse_repo_contents should have directory_name as \"nodejs-welcome.git\". But the user's initial step was to clone the repo. So the directory_name is the same as the cloned repo. So the steps are correct.\n\nI think that's all. No parameters are missing here. Each function call is needed as per the steps."}

They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the get_relevant_classes function seems relevant. The parameters needed are a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case sensitivity can be set to false if the user wants to match case-insensitively, but since the error mentions 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is better. The include_subdirectories parameter should be true to include subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. The method names here are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue', so I need to call get_signature with those parameters. The class_name should be 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method names as specified.\n\nWait, the user's original question mentions that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. So maybe the get_relevant_classes function is needed to find 'CellResult' in the repository. Also, the get_signature function would help verify the method signatures in the overridden class.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For get_relevant_classes, the search string is 'CellResult', case_sensitive is false (since the error is about 'CellResult'), and include_subdirectories is true. For get_signature, class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue', and include_private is true if needed. But the include_private is optional, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with the search string, include subdirectories, and get_signature for the two methods in the overridden class. That should cover the user's needs."}

The user mentioned Queenstown Singapore, so I should set location to \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The unit parameter is optional, but maybe the user didn't specify, so I can leave it out or set it to 'celsius' if needed.
