This is ambiguous. Does it mean find HCF of result1 and (90, 120)? But HCF needs two numbers, not one and a pair.\n\nPerhaps it means find HCF of result1 and the HCF of (90, 120).

Additionally, find HCF of (36, 48) = result3\n\n4. Then, find the highest common factor of that result (result3) with the pair (72, 96), so probably find HCF of (72, 96) = result4, then HCF of result3 and result4.\n\nSo, in total, I need to perform several HCF calculations and chain them.\n\nSince the function only takes two numbers at a time, I have to call it multiple times and use the outputs of previous calls as inputs to new ones.\n\nIn this system, I can make multiple function calls in one response, and the system will execute them sequentially.\n\nThe format allows: <TOOLCALL>[{\"function\":\"func1\",...}, {\"function\":\"func2\",...}]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, I need result1 = HCF(45, 60)\n\nThen, result2 = HCF(90, 120)\n\nThen, final for first part: HCF(result1, result2)\n\nSimilarly, result3 = HCF(36, 48)\n\nThen, result4 = HCF(72, 96)\n\nThen, final for second part: HCF(result3, result4)\n\nThe problem is, in one turn, I can call functions, but the outputs aren't available yet for subsequent calls in the same response.
