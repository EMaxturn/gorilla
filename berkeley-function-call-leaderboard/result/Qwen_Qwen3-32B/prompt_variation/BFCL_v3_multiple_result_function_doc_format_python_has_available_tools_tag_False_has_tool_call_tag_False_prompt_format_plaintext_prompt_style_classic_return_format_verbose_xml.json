The user's values are all integers here: 20, 10, 5. So I can pass them as integers. The function should handle it.

The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', the platform is PlayStation, and the region is United States. \n\nI don't need to check if it's on sale because the store_price function should return the current price regardless of sale status. However, if the user wanted to know if it's on sale, that's a separate check. But since they're asking for the price, I can directly call store_price with the given parameters. \n\nWait, the default region for some functions is United States, but in this case, the user specified United States, so including it explicitly is better. \n\nSo the correct function call is video_games.store_price with the parameters game_title set to 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as 'PlayStation', and region as 'United States'. \n\nI don't see any other functions needed here.

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are kinematic equations. The user mentioned starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. They gave distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_speed_from_rest. The parameters it needs are distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). That fits perfectly here. The function is designed exactly for this scenario: starting from rest, constant acceleration, given distance and time. So I should use that function.\n\nWait, let me check the parameters again. The function requires distance as an integer, time as an integer, and initial_speed defaults to 0. The user provided 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. So that's perfect. The initial speed is 0, so we don't need to specify it. So the function call would be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. \n\nI don't think I need to use calculate_acceleration here because the question is asking for speed, not acceleration. The calculate_speed_from_rest function should directly give the final speed. Let me confirm the formula. The formula for speed when starting from rest and moving with constant acceleration over a distance is v = (2d)/t. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the correct formula is v\u00b2 = 2ad, and since a = d/(t\u00b2) * 2? Wait, maybe I should recall the kinematic equations. \n\nThe correct equation for final velocity when starting from rest and moving with constant acceleration over distance d is v = sqrt(2ad). But acceleration can be found from d = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2, so a = 2d/t\u00b2. Substituting into v gives v = sqrt(2*(2d/t\u00b2)*d) = sqrt(4d\u00b2/t\u00b2) = 2d/t. So v = 2d/t. So in this case, 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. So the function should return 10 m/s. \n\nTherefore, using calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4 is the right approach. The function should handle that calculation. So the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nThe function calculate_final_temperature seems relevant here. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function.

So I should call sort_list with the elements parameter set to the list of names and order as 'asc' or just rely on the default.

Either way, the function should handle it. \n\nSo the correct function call would be sort_list with elements ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order 'asc'.

The user mentioned \"top rated,\" which relates to user ratings, and specified the location as New York and the art form as modern sculpture. The month is upcoming, so maybe the default value for the month parameter in the function can handle that.\n\nSo, I should call find_exhibition with location set to \"New York\", art_form as \"modern sculpture\", month as the default (which might be upcoming), and user_ratings set to \"high\" since they want top-rated. The parameters need to be checked. The function's args are location (str), art_form (str), month (str, default upcoming), and user_ratings (str, default 'high'). The user wants top-rated, so maybe user_ratings should be 'high' or higher. Since the default for user_ratings is already 'high', maybe we don't need to specify it, but to be safe, include it. The month is upcoming, so the default might be the next month, but the user says \"upcoming month,\" so maybe set month to the current upcoming month. However, since the default returns upcoming events, maybe leaving it as default is okay. \n\nWait, the function's month parameter's default returns upcoming events. So if we don't specify the month, it will automatically check for upcoming. But the user specifically says \"upcoming month,\" so maybe setting month to the next month's name. However, without knowing the current date, the function might handle it with the default. To comply with the user's input, perhaps set month to the upcoming month.

The function's example uses \"sculpture,\" but maybe the art_form parameter can accept more specific terms. If the user specifies \"modern sculpture,\" perhaps that's better to include. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle it if we just put \"sculpture\" and the system filters by modern. But since the user is explicit, it's safer to put \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form. \n\nPutting it all together: call find_exhibition with location=\"New York\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", month=default (upcoming), user_ratings=\"high\". Since the default for user_ratings is already 'high', maybe we can omit it, but including it makes it explicit. The function's parameters for user_ratings is a string, so \"high\" is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be find_exhibition with those parameters."}
