There's get_sculpture_details which requires museum_location and sculpture_id. But the user didn't mention any IDs, so that might not be helpful here. Then there's get_artwork_price, which needs museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nWait, the user provided the materials (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 and 6x3) along with the museum locations (Philadelphia and New York). So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price. But the function parameters require the size as a list. The user's input has \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to convert those into lists of numbers. Maybe [4,4] and [6,3]? But the function might expect three dimensions, but the user gave two. Hmm, maybe it's okay since the function's parameters say sculpture_size is a list, and the user provided two dimensions. \n\nSo for the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is [4,4]. For the second: museum_location is New York, material is bronze, size [6,3]. Then, call get_artwork_price for each. But the user wants the average price. So I need to get both prices and then average them. However, the functions can only be called one at a time. So first call for Philadelphia's marble statue, then for New York's bronze sculpture. Once I have both prices, compute the average. But since the assistant can only make function calls, I need to make both calls first. \n\nWait, the user's question is a single query. The assistant needs to make two separate function calls. Then, once the prices are retrieved, calculate the average. But the assistant can't perform calculations, only call functions. So the answer would be the two function calls, and then the system would handle the average. But according to the instructions, the assistant should return the function calls. So the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price twice with the respective parameters."}

Wait, the note says for the 1700s, input '18'. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the 1700s are the 18th century. So the function's example says for the 1700s, input '18'. So the century parameter is the number of the century, not the actual year. So the 17th century is 17, which would be 1600s.
