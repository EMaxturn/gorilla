There's animal_population.get_history for historical data and animal_population.get_projection for future projections. \n\nFor the historical part, the user mentioned Bangladesh and India. The function requires country, species, and years. The species here is tiger, and the years are 5. So I need to call get_history twice, once for each country.\n\nThen, for the projections in Nepal and Malaysia, the function get_projection is needed. Again, species is tiger, and the years are 10. So another two calls for these countries.\n\nWait, the parameters are all there. The user specified the countries, species, and the number of years. So each part of the query maps to a function call. No missing parameters. So I should generate four function calls in total: two for historical data and two for projections."}

Also, they want the residuals calculated and returned.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data from the CSV file. The data_loading function is available for that. The parameters required are file_path and optionally delimiter. The user provided the file name as dataset.csv, so I'll set file_path to that. There's no mention of a different delimiter, so I'll omit that parameter.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to perform the linear regression. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y arrays, which in this case are data['sales'] and data['future_sales']. The user also wants the residuals, so I need to set return_residuals to true. \n\nWait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit are x and y as arrays. Assuming that data is a DataFrame or similar structure, extracting the columns 'sales' and 'future_sales' as arrays should work. The return_residuals parameter is a boolean, so setting that to true will include the residuals in the output.\n\nSo the steps are: call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv', then use the resulting data to call linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly referenced. Since the data is loaded into a data structure, the function calls should correctly access those columns. Also, check if the parameters are required. The data_loading requires file_path, which is provided. The linear_regression_fit requires x and y, which are provided via the data columns. The return_residuals is optional but needed here.\n\nSo the function calls should be first data_loading, then linear_regression_fit with the specified parameters."}

The user has three parts to their question, so I need to handle each part with the appropriate function calls.\n\nFirst, they want the total energy produced from 5 moles of glucose. The function calc_energy seems right here. The parameters needed are mols, substance, and optionally joules_per_mol. The user provided 5 moles of glucose (C6H12O6) and mentioned the energy is 2800 kJ/mol. So I'll use calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800. That should give the total energy.\n\nNext, calculating biomass using the energy and 10% efficiency. The calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step will be used here. Since efficiency is 10%, I'll set efficiency=0.10. But wait, the first step's output is needed here, so I need to make sure the first function is called first. The user hasn't provided the energy value yet, so the second function call depends on the first. But since the user is asking for the process, I should generate the function calls in order. So after getting the energy from calc_energy, then use that energy in calc_biomass with efficiency 10%.\n\nThird, calculating work done by the machine. The work function requires energy and distance. The energy here would be the same as the total energy from the first step, and the distance is 2 meters. So after getting the total energy, call calc_work with energy (from first step) and distance=2.\n\nNow, checking if all parameters are provided. For the first function, all required parameters are there. The second function needs energy (which comes from first) and efficiency. The third needs energy (from first) and distance. So the order is correct. Each function call depends on the previous output. So the tool calls should be in sequence: calc_energy first, then calc_biomass, then calc_work."}

The second one requires checking if the team's top scorer is someone else. The third one uses the season parameter. All required parameters are provided, so no missing info. Let's structure the tool calls accordingly."}

They want help planning meals for the day with specific requirements for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \n\nFirst, for breakfast, they mentioned using eggs, milk, and bread, with a calorie limit of 300. The recipe_search function seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are ingredients as an array and calories as an integer. The meal type is breakfast, so I should include that.\n\nNext, lunch involves finding a restaurant that serves dishes with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, under 500 calories. The restaurant_search function fits here. Again, ingredients as an array and calories as an integer are required. The meal type here might be lunch, so specifying that would be good.\n\nFor dinner, they have a recipe with beef but want to replace it with tofu while keeping calories under 600. The ingredient_replace function is needed here. The original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and the calories should be 600. However, I need to check if the original recipe's calories are known. Since the user hasn't provided the original calorie count, maybe the function assumes the existing recipe's calories and adjusts based on the replacement. But the function requires calories as a parameter, so I'll have to use 600 as specified.\n\nWait, the user says \"keep the total calories under 600.\" So the calories parameter in ingredient_replace should be 600. But does the function calculate the new calories after replacement? The description says it keeps calories below a certain number, so setting calories to 600 makes sense.\n\nNow, checking if all parameters are provided. For recipe_search (breakfast), ingredients are eggs, milk, bread, calories 300, meal breakfast. For restaurant_search (lunch), ingredients chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, calories 500, meal lunch. For ingredient_replace (dinner), original_ingredient beef, replacement_ingredient tofu, calories 600. \n\nAll required parameters are present. So three function calls are needed."}

They've asked four different things, so I need to handle each part one by one.\n\nFirst, they want the function of ATP in the mitochondria with a specific function. The cell_biology.function_lookup function seems right here. The parameters needed are molecule, organelle, and specific_function. ATP is the molecule, mitochondria is the organelle, and specific_function should be true. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle that. The origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles, and the unit should be miles since they specified miles. The unit parameter is optional, defaulting to kilometers, so I need to set it to miles here.\n\nThird, they're asking for the scientist credited with the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes the discovery as a parameter. The theory of relativity is the discovery here, so I'll use that function with \"theory of relativity\" as the parameter.\n\nLastly, the current retail price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function requires brand, model, and finish. Brand is Fender, model is Stratocaster, and finish is sunburst. So I'll call that function with those three parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For the first function, specific_function is required and set to true. The distance function needs origin and destination, which are provided, and unit is optional but specified. The scientist function needs the discovery, which is given. The instrument function requires brand, model, and finish, all of which are present. So all parameters are covered. Now, I'll structure each function call in the required JSON format."}

The user has a few different tasks here, so I need to break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, they want to modify a painting. The original attributes are 24x36 inches, acrylic, and blue. The changes are to 30x40 inches, oil, and red. Looking at the functions available, there's 'modify_painting' which takes size, medium, and dominant_color. All required parameters are provided except dominant_color is optional but they want to change it to red. So I'll need to call modify_painting with those values.\n\nNext, predicting the evolutionary rate of African elephants for 100 years using the Darwin model. The 'prediction.evolution' function requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, and model is Darwin. All parameters are present, so that's another function call.\n\nThen, calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker. The 'calculate_probability' function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user mentions 4 favorable outcomes out of 52 cards. Wait, but in a standard deck, there are 4 possible royal flushes (one per suit). However, the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5) which is 2,598,960. But the user says to use the given numbers: total_outcomes is 52 and favorable is 4? Wait, that doesn't make sense because total outcomes should be all possible 5-card hands. But the user might have simplified it. However, the question states that in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible royal flush outcomes. So maybe they're considering each card as an outcome? That's not standard, but since the user specifies those numbers, I should use them. So total_outcomes is 52, favorable is 4, and round_to 3. So call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nWait, but the royal flush probability is actually 4 / (52 choose 5), which is about 0.00000154, but the user might have a different approach. But according to their input, they want to use total_outcomes as 52 and favorable as 4. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the function calls are as follows."}

All these parameters are provided, so I can call that function.\n\nNext, they need information on lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs the entity (John Doe) and county (San Francisco). The state is optional and defaults to California, which matches the user's mention of San Francisco, CA. So that function call should work.\n\nLastly, the probability of winning a lottery with 1000 total outcomes and 5 favorable, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. All parameters are present, so that's straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. No missing info here. All three functions can be called with the given data.

They specified fish, so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in the Asia region. The game_score.highest function fits.
