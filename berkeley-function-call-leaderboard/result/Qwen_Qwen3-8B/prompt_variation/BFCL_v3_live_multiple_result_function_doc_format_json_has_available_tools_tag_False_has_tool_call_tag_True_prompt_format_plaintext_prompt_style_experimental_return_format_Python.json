I need to check the available functions to see which one to use.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. The first one, uber.ride, requires loc, type, and time. The parameters for loc need to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. That fits perfectly with uber.ride's parameters. \n\nThe second function, uber.ride2, also has loc and type, but the loc format is 'City, State', and it has a default time of 10. However, the user specified the street address, so using uber.ride2 might not capture the exact location. Plus, the time is already 10, which matches the default, but the user explicitly mentioned it. \n\nSince uber.ride requires all three parameters and the user provided all, it's better to use uber.ride. The parameters are all there: loc is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type is 'plus', and time is 10. So the correct function call should be to uber.ride with those parameters."}

The user wants information about the Imjin War, specifically asking to search the internet using the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' and get the results in text format with a maximum of 10 entries.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The HNA_WQA.search function seems appropriate here because it's designed for web searches using keywords. The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. \n\nThe user specified the keyword as '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', which is in Korean. The result_format should be 'text' as requested. The max_results is 10, which matches the default value, but it's safe to include it explicitly. The language parameter isn't specified, so the default 'EN' might be okay, but since the keyword is Korean, maybe the user expects Korean results. However, the function's default is English, and the user didn't mention language preference. Hmm, but the keyword is in Korean, so perhaps the search should be in Korean. Wait, the HNA_WQA's language parameter defaults to 'EN', but the user might want Korean results. However, the function's description says the keyword is the search term, so maybe the language is handled by the search engine. Alternatively, maybe the language parameter affects the results' language. Since the user didn't specify, sticking with the default 'EN' might be safer unless there's a way to set it to 'KO'. But looking at the parameters, the language enum includes 'EN', 'ES', 'FR', 'DE'\u2014no 'KO'. So the default is English. But the user is asking for information on the Imjin War, which is a historical event in Korea. Maybe the user wants Korean sources. However, the function doesn't support Korean as an option. So perhaps the best is to proceed with the default, but note that the results might be in English. Alternatively, maybe the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' in English would be 'Imjin War', but the user specified the keyword in Korean. \n\nWait, the HNA_WQA's keyword parameter is a string, so the user provided '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' as the keyword. The function's language parameter defaults to 'EN', but the keyword is in Korean. The function might handle it by searching for the Korean term. However, the language parameter might affect the results' language. Since the user didn't specify, but the keyword is in Korean, maybe the function can still process it. \n\nIn any case, the user's main request is to search with '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' as the keyword, text format, and max 10 results. So the function call should include those parameters. The other parameters like language can be left as default unless specified. So the correct function call would be HNA_WQA.search with keyword='\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format='text', max_results=10. The language is default 'EN', which might not be ideal, but the user didn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the results in Korean, but since the function doesn't support 'KO' in the language enum, it's not possible.

The available function is 'recall_memory_search' which takes a query. So I'll use that with the query \"Shishir Patil birthday\".\n\nWait, but the user might have provided this info before. If the search returns the birthday, great. If not, maybe the archival memory has it. But according to the functions, I can only search recall memory with the given function.

Then, use 'send_message' to send a congrats message. The message should include the birthday and a happy birthday wish. Also, maybe add an emoji for festivity.\n\nBut wait, the user said \"contraguation\" which is probably a typo for \"congratulation\". So the message should be a birthday greeting. Need to make sure the parameters for send_message are correct: message content, recipient (maybe Shishir's email or phone number?), priority, and timestamp. The recipient isn't provided, so maybe use a default. The user might expect the message to be sent to Shishir, but without the contact info, the default is used. Alternatively, maybe the core memory has the recipient's details. But the core memory's human sub-block might have that info. If not, proceed with the default.\n\nSo steps: 1.

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, account name, start and end balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems perfect here. It requires bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview needs total deposits, total withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. \n\nThe user provided all these details: bank name is U.S. Bank, account number is 1-523-1713-5704, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The start date is October 1, 2019, end date October 31, 2019. Total deposits $7,132.76 and withdrawals $5,927.40. Also, starting balance $5,532.01 and ending $6,737.37. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview properties include total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The starting and ending balances are part of the transaction_overview? Wait, looking back, the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. But the user also mentioned starting and ending balances. However, the BankStatementOverView function's parameters don't include starting_balance or ending_balance. Wait, the BankStatementOverView's parameters have a transaction_overview which includes start_date and end_date, but not the balances. However, the user wants the overview to include those balances. Wait, maybe the transaction_overview is a dict, and perhaps the balances are part of that. Wait, looking at the parameters again: the transaction_overview is a dict with properties total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So the balances might not be part of that. But the user mentioned starting and ending balances. Hmm, maybe the BankStatementOverView function's description says it provides an overview including account info and a summary of transactions. The parameters for BankStatementOverView include transaction_overview which has totals and dates. But the balances are not in that. However, the user wants the overview to include those balances. Wait, maybe the function's transaction_overview is supposed to include those? Or perhaps the balances are part of the account info. Wait, the BankStatementOverView parameters don't have starting_balance or ending_balance. So maybe the function doesn't include those. But the user wants them included. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed. Let me check.\n\nThe transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. So maybe the BankStatementOverView is the right one, even if it doesn't include the balances. But the user specifically mentioned the beginning and ending balances. Wait, maybe the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview is supposed to include those? Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So the balances are not part of that. Therefore, the BankStatementOverView might not include the balances. But the user wants them in the overview. Hmm. Maybe the function is designed to include those balances in the account info, but the parameters don't show that. Alternatively, perhaps the user's mention of starting and ending balances is part of the transaction_overview. But according to the schema, it's not. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting the BankStatementOverView to include the balances. Since the function's description says it provides an overview including account info and a summary of transactions. Maybe the account info includes the balances. But the parameters for BankStatementOverView don't have those. So perhaps the function is designed to have the balances as part of the transaction_overview. But according to the parameters, it's not. This is a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's request can be fulfilled by using the BankStatementOverView function with the provided data, even if the balances aren't included. But the user explicitly mentioned the beginning and ending balances. So perhaps the function's transaction_overview should include those. But according to the schema, it doesn't. Maybe the user's mention of balances is separate from the transaction_overview. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a summary that includes the totals and dates, and the balances are part of the account info. But the parameters don't have that. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. However, given the available functions, the BankStatementOverView seems the best fit. The user provided all the required parameters for that function. The transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided those. The starting and ending balances are not part of the transaction_overview parameters, but the user wants them included. However, the function's parameters don't include them. So maybe the function's description is a bit misleading, or perhaps the balances are part of the account info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's mention of the balances is part of the transaction_overview. But according to the schema, it's not. So perhaps the function can still be called with the available parameters, and the balances are included in the response even if not in the parameters. \n\nIn any case, the user's main request is for an overview of the bank statement, which includes the account info and transaction summary. The BankStatementOverView function seems to fit. So I'll proceed to call that function with the provided data. \n\nSo the parameters for BankStatementOverView are:\n\nbank_name: U.S. Bank\naccount_number: 1-523-1713-5704\naccount_type: checking\nfull_name: SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\ntransaction_overview: {\n    total_deposits: 7132.76,\n    total_withdrawals: 5927.40,\n    start_date: '2019-10-01',\n    end_date: '2019-10-31'\n}\n\nBut the user also mentioned starting and ending balances. However, the function's parameters don't include those. So maybe the function's response will include them, even if not in the parameters. Alternatively, the user might need to use another function. \n\nWait, the TotalTransactions.calculate function requires starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance. But the user wants a summary of transactions, which might be covered by the transaction_summary.generate function. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. \n\nBut the user's main request is for the BankStatementOverView. So I'll proceed with that. \n\nSo the function call would be BankStatementOverView with the parameters as above. \n\nAdditionally, the user wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions (array of transaction details), starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate can't be used here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview includes the totals and dates, which is what the user wants. \n\nSo the main function call is BankStatementOverView. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants. Its parameters include category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate priced, which matches the price_range parameter's enum value 'moderate'. The location is New York, so I need to format it as 'New York, NY'. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The category isn't specified, so maybe I should leave that out or set a default? Wait, the required parameters are category and location. Since the user didn't specify a cuisine type, perhaps the function allows category to be optional? Wait, no, the required fields are category and location. Hmm, that's a problem. The user didn't mention a category. But the function requires it. Maybe I should assume a default category? But the enum for category has specific options. Alternatively, maybe the user didn't specify, so perhaps the function can handle it? Wait, no, the parameters say 'required': ['category', 'location'], so category is required. But the user hasn't provided it. How to handle this? Maybe the user's query is missing that info. But the user might be okay with any category as long as price is moderate and outdoor seating. But the function requires category. So perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Wait, maybe the user's query is incomplete. But since the user hasn't provided a category, maybe I should proceed by leaving category out? But the function requires it. Alternatively, maybe the function allows category to be optional? Let me check again. The parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'required': ['category', 'location'], so category is required. Therefore, the user's query is missing the category. But the user might not have specified it. How to proceed? Maybe the assistant should ask for the category. But the user's instruction says to generate function calls if possible. Since the user hasn't provided a category, perhaps the function can't be called. But the user might be okay with any category. Wait, maybe the category can be left as a default? But the parameters don't mention a default for category. So this is a problem. However, the user's main points are price range and outdoor seating. Maybe the assistant can proceed by using a placeholder or a general category. Alternatively, maybe the function allows category to be omitted, but according to the schema, it's required. So perhaps the user's query is incomplete. But the user might not have realized that. In this case, maybe the assistant should proceed by using a default category, but since there's no default, perhaps the function can't be called. Wait, but the user might be okay with any category. Maybe the assistant can use a wildcard or a general term. However, the enum for category includes options like 'Mexican', 'Bistro', etc. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant should proceed without the category, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make an assumption, like 'American' as a default. But that's speculative. However, the user's main request is about price and outdoor seating. So perhaps the assistant should proceed by including the required parameters, even if category is missing. Wait, but the function requires category. So the assistant can't call the function without it. Therefore, the user's query is missing a required parameter. But the user might not have provided it. In that case, the assistant should indicate that the required parameter is missing. However, the user's instruction says to generate function calls if possible. So perhaps the assistant should proceed by using a placeholder or a default. But since the function requires category, and there's no default, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameter 'category' is missing. But the user's query might have intended to include it. Alternatively, maybe the user's query is incomplete. So the assistant should respond that the category is missing. But the user's original query says \"find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York\". The category is not mentioned. Therefore, the required parameter is missing. So the function can't be called. Therefore, the assistant should indicate that the required parameter is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the category but forgot. But according to the given functions, the category is required. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says to generate function calls if possible. So perhaps the assistant should proceed by using a default category. But since there's no default, maybe the assistant can't. Therefore, the answer is that the required parameter 'category' is missing. But the user's query might have intended to include it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using a general category. For example, maybe the category can be left as an empty string, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't call the function. So the correct response is to indicate that the required parameter is missing. However, the user's instruction says to generate function calls if possible. Therefore, the assistant should proceed by using the available parameters and note the missing one. But according to the problem statement, if required parameters are missing, the assistant should indicate that. Therefore, the answer is that the required parameter 'category' is missing. But the user's query might have intended to include it. However, based on the given information, the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the function call can't be made. So the assistant should indicate that the required parameter is missing. But the user's query might have intended to provide the category. However, in the absence of that information, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameter is missing."}
{"id": "live_multiple_305-131-4", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to book a hotel for studio sessions, starting on the 15th of July and staying for 5 days. First, I need to figure out the check-in date and stay length. The 15th of July is the check-in date, so that's '2023-07-15' assuming this year. The stay is 5 days, so stay_length is 5.\n\nLooking at the available functions, Hotels_4_ReserveHotel is the one to use here. The required parameters are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, and location. The user mentioned \"studio sessions,\" but didn't specify the location. Wait, the user didn't mention the city or location. Hmm, that's a problem. The function requires location, but it's not provided. The default for location is 'dontcare', but maybe the user expects me to ask for it. However, the user might have mentioned it earlier, but in the current query, it's missing. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"go to the studio sessions\" but doesn't specify where. Maybe the studio is in a specific city, but without that info, I can't proceed. The function requires location, so I need to get that. But the user hasn't provided it. However, looking back, maybe the user mentioned the location in a previous message? The current query is standalone. \n\nSince the location is missing, but the function requires it, I can't call the function yet. But the user might have intended to provide the location. Wait, the user wrote \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Wait, maybe there's a typo here. The user might have meant \"book on the 15th of July, staying for 5 days?\" So the check-in is July 15th, and the stay is 5 days. But the location is still missing. \n\nSince the location is required, but not provided, I need to inform the user. However, the instructions say to generate function calls if possible. But without location, the function can't be called. So maybe the answer is to indicate that the location is missing. But the user might have intended to include it. Alternatively, maybe the studio sessions are in a known location, but that's not specified. \n\nWait, the user might have mentioned the location in the previous messages. But in the current context, the user's query is standalone. So, the location is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the location is implied. For example, if the user is referring to a studio in a specific city, but without that info, it's impossible. \n\nIn this case, since the location is required and not provided, the correct response is to indicate that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide it. But given the current query, the location is missing. Therefore, the function call can't be made. But the user might have made a typo. Let me check again. The user wrote \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe the \"2staying\" is a typo for \"staying\". So the check-in is July 15th, stay 5 days. But location is still missing. \n\nSo, the answer should be to call Hotels_4_ReserveHotel with the available parameters, but since location is required, it's missing. Therefore, the function can't be called. But the user might have intended to provide the location. However, in the given query, it's not there. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the location is missing. But according to the instructions, if required parameters are missing, I should indicate that. However, the user might have intended to provide the location in the query. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a studio in a specific city, but that's not mentioned. So, the function requires location, which is missing. Therefore, the answer is to indicate that the location is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a specific location, but that's not specified. \n\nIn this case, the correct approach is to call the function with the available parameters, but since location is required and missing, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should state that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide it. But given the current query, the location is not present. \n\nSo, the final answer is that the location is missing, but according to the instructions, if required parameters are missing, I should indicate that. However, the user might have intended to provide the location. But in the given query, it's not there. Therefore, the function call can't be made. But the user might have made a mistake. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe the \"2staying\" is a typo for \"staying\". So the check-in is July 15th, stay 5 days. But location is still missing. Therefore, the function can't be called. So the answer is to indicate that the location is missing. But the user might have intended to provide it. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, if required parameters are missing, I should indicate that. Therefore, the answer is to indicate that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide it. But given the current query, it's not there. \n\nSo, the correct response is to call the Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function with the available parameters, but since location is required and missing, it's not possible. Therefore, the answer is to indicate that the location is missing. But the user might have intended to provide it. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if required parameters are missing, I should indicate that. Therefore, the answer is to indicate that the location is missing. However, the user might have made a mistake. \n\nIn conclusion, the function call can't be made because the location is missing.

{"id": "live_multiple_569-155-9", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to find cultural events in Las Vegas on March 6th, 2023. Let me check the available functions. There's Events_3_FindEvents which takes event_type, city, and date. The parameters required are event_type and city, with date being optional. The user specified concerts or plays, which are the enum options for event_type. The city is Las Vegas, and the date is March 6th, 2023. So I need to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as 'Music' or 'Theater', but the user mentioned both. Wait, the enum for event_type is ['Music', 'Theater'], so maybe the function can handle either. But the user wants both types. However, the function might require selecting one. Wait, looking at the parameters again: the event_type is a single string, but the user wants both. Hmm, maybe the function can accept multiple types? Wait, no, the parameters say 'event_type' is a string with enum values. So perhaps the user needs to specify one. But the user asked for concerts or plays, which are both types. Maybe the function can take either, but the user might need to choose. Wait, maybe the function can handle multiple types if the user specifies both? Wait, the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents have event_type as a string, not a list. So perhaps the user needs to specify one. But the user wants both. Hmm, maybe the function can accept 'Music' or 'Theater' separately. So maybe I need to make two separate calls? Or maybe the user can input both. Wait, the function's parameters don't allow multiple values. So perhaps the user has to choose one. But the user's query is for both. Maybe the function can take 'Music' and 'Theater' as separate calls. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a different value. Wait, the enum is ['Music', 'Theater'], so maybe the user can only select one. But the user wants both. Hmm, perhaps the function isn't designed for that. But the user's request is to find both. So maybe the best approach is to call the function twice, once for Music and once for Theater. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a different value. Wait, the description says \"cultural events, such as concerts and plays\", so maybe the function can handle both if the event_type is set to either. But the user might need to specify each. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a different value. Wait, the parameters for event_type are limited to Music or Theater. So perhaps the user needs to make two separate calls.

Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a different value. But according to the parameters, it's limited. So perhaps the correct approach is to call the function with event_type as 'Music' and 'Theater' separately. But the user might not have specified which one.

The available functions include Music_3_LookupMusic and Music_3_PlayMedia.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic, it allows specifying album and year. The user mentioned either the album 'High Expectations' or songs from 2019. So, maybe I should first use LookupMusic to find songs matching those criteria. But the user might want to play the music directly. However, PlayMedia requires a track name, which the user hasn't specified yet. So perhaps first use LookupMusic to get a list of songs that fit either the album or the year, then use PlayMedia with the track name from the results. But since the user hasn't specified a particular track, maybe the LookupMusic can provide the necessary track names. Alternatively, if the user is okay with any track from those criteria, maybe the LookupMusic can return a list, and then PlayMedia can be used with one of them. But the user's query is a bit ambiguous. They might want to play a track from the album or from 2019. Since the functions don't allow combining both criteria, maybe two separate calls: one for the album and one for the year. But the user said \"or alternatively,\" so perhaps they want either. However, the system needs to generate function calls. Let me check the parameters again. Music_3_LookupMusic can take album and year as parameters. If I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 'dontcare', that would get songs from that album. Alternatively, set year to '2019' and album to 'dontcare'. But the user wants either, so maybe two separate calls. However, the user might not want both. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle both in one call by using OR logic, but the function parameters don't support that. So perhaps two separate LookupMusic calls. But the user might not need both. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with any of the two, so the assistant can first look up songs from the album, and if none, then look up 2019 songs.

However, the user might not want both. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use one call with album 'High Expectations' and another with year '2019'. But the user's query is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the functions again. The Music_3_PlayMedia requires a track name, which the user hasn't provided. So the assistant might need to first use LookupMusic to find tracks, then use PlayMedia. But the user's message is a request to \"hear a track,\" so maybe the assistant should first find the tracks and then play them. However, the assistant's role is to generate the function calls. So the first step is to look up the tracks using LookupMusic with the given criteria. Then, once the tracks are found, PlayMedia can be used. But since the user hasn't specified a particular track, the assistant might need to make a call to LookupMusic to get the list, and then perhaps another call to PlayMedia with one of the tracks. However, the user's message doesn't specify which track, so the assistant might need to first retrieve the list. Therefore, the first function call should be Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare' to get tracks from that album. If that returns no results, then another call with year '2019' and album 'dontcare'. But the user's query is to \"hear a track from the album or any song from 2019,\" so the assistant should generate two separate LookupMusic calls. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use one call with album 'High Expectations' and another with year '2019'. But the user might not need both. However, the assistant's task is to generate the necessary function calls based on the user's input. So the correct approach is to first use Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare', and then if needed, another call with year '2019'. But since the user hasn't specified which one, the assistant might need to generate both. However, the user might be okay with either, so the assistant can make both calls.

So the parameters for LookupMusic would be artist='dontcare', album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Country', year='2019'. \n\nOnce that's done, the next step would be to play a track from the results. But the user hasn't specified which track yet. So first, we need to look up the songs, then present them, and then play one. But the user's initial request is to \"hear a song\", so maybe after looking up, we can play one. However, the functions are separate.

But the user mentioned Hillbilly style. Since the genre parameter doesn't include Hillbilly, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available options. \n\nSo, the function calls would be first to look up the songs with the given album, year, and genre (assuming Country), then play one. But the user hasn't specified a track yet. So the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters as discussed.

The required fields are restaurant_name, location, time, and date. The user provided all these except the date. They mentioned \"this Friday,\" which I need to convert into an ISO date format. Assuming today's date is October 10, 2023, this Friday would be October 13, 2023. But since the current date isn't given, maybe I should use the current date or ask for clarification.

The number_of_seats is four. \n\nWait, the parameters for ReserveRestaurant have a default for number_of_seats as 2, but the user specified four, so that needs to be included.

The date needs to be in ISO format. Since the user didn't specify the exact date, but said \"this Friday,\" the system might need to determine the correct date. However, without knowing the current date, maybe the function can handle relative dates, but the parameter requires an ISO string. So perhaps the user's message implies that the date is already known, and the assistant should use the current date's Friday. But since the assistant might not have real-time data, maybe the user expects the function to be called with the date as \"this Friday\" converted. However, the function's date parameter expects a string in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant needs to calculate the correct date. \n\nAssuming today is October 12, 2023, then this Friday would be October 13, 2023. So the date parameter would be \"2023-10-13\".

However, the function's parameters require a specific date in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant must determine the correct date based on the current date. Since the current date isn't provided, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the assumption that \"this Friday\" is correctly converted. \n\nSo the final function call would be to ReserveRestaurant with those parameters."}

The function has parameters like province_id, district_name, start_available_date, end_available_date, and avg_rating. \n\nThe user mentioned Bangkok, which I know is province_id 1.

So that's perfect. The other functions are for monthly data or monitoring state, which don't fit the specific date request. So I should call get_hosts_per_day with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions to see which ones can help.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions, there's 'get_api_tokens' from the 'api_token_api.APITokenApi' which retrieves a list of API tokens for a user. The parameters required are 'user_id' and optionally 'include_expired'. Since the user wants all tokens, maybe including expired ones would be necessary. But the default for include_expired is False, so I should set that to True to make sure all tokens are listed.\n\nThen there's 'get_shareable_api_tokens' from 'CustomDashboardsApi', which also retrieves API tokens but specifically for custom dashboards. The user didn't mention anything about dashboards, so this might not be relevant here. But maybe they have shareable tokens related to dashboards that they need. However, since the user's main request is about their API tokens in general, I should focus on the first function.\n\nThe third function is 'post_api_token' for creating a new token, which isn't needed here since the user is trying to retrieve existing ones.\n\nSo the main function to use is 'get_api_tokens' with user_id 'user123' and include_expired set to True. That should retrieve all tokens, including any expired ones, which would cover all possible tokens the user has. The other function about dashboards isn't necessary unless specified, so I'll stick with the first one."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the alert type is error rate with a threshold of 5%, and notifications need to go to two email addresses.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's create_global_application_alert_config, which seems right. The parameters required are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled. The name is given. The alert_type should be 'error_rate' from the enum. Threshold is 5%, which as a float is 0.05. Recipients are the two emails provided. Enabled is optional with default True, so maybe include it unless specified otherwise. The user didn't mention disabling it, so assume enabled is True.\n\nWait, the threshold for error rate\u2014does it expect a percentage as a float? Like 5% would be 0.05. That makes sense. The function parameters say threshold is a float. So that's correct.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. Let me make sure all required fields are there: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. Yes. The recipients are an array of the two emails. Enabled is optional, but including it as True might be good for clarity, though the default is already True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just rely on the default. However, the function's enabled parameter has a default of True, so it's not required. So the call should include the other parameters. Alright, that's all."}

Let me check the available functions. There are two functions that retrieve API tokens: CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. \n\nThe user provided their user ID, which is 12345. The first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires a user_id and includes a parameter to include revoked tokens. The default for include_revoked is False. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe they want both active and revoked ones. However, the description says \"shareable\" tokens, which might be a subset.\n\nThe second function, get_api_tokens, has parameters include_expired, page, and page_size. The default for include_expired is False, but the user might want all tokens, including expired ones. However, the function's default page is 1 and page_size is 20. Since the user says \"ALL\", maybe they need to handle pagination. But without knowing the total number of tokens, it's hard to say. The function might not support retrieving all in one call.\n\nWait, the user's main request is to get all API tokens. The first function's description mentions \"shareable\" tokens, which might not be all. The second function's name is get_api_tokens, which sounds more comprehensive. But the parameters don't have an option to include all, except include_expired. However, the user might not have mentioned expired tokens. \n\nBut the user's message is urgent: \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!!\" So maybe they want every token, including expired and revoked. However, the functions available don't have a parameter to include all. The get_api_tokens function has include_expired, but the get_shareable_api_tokens has include_revoked. \n\nSo to get all tokens, maybe the user needs to call both functions. But the first function is for shareable tokens, which might be a different set. Alternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function can be called with include_expired=True and page=1, page_size=100 (max). But the default page_size is 20. If the user wants all, they might need to loop through pages, but the function doesn't support that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's user ID is 12345, so we can call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. Then call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, but the user_id isn't a parameter here. Wait, the get_api_tokens function's parameters don't include user_id. The description says \"associated with the user's account,\" but the parameters don't have a user_id. That's confusing. \n\nWait, looking back at the parameters for get_api_tokens: the parameters are include_expired, page, page_size. There's no user_id parameter. So how does it know which user's tokens to retrieve? Maybe the function is authenticated via the context, like the user is already logged in. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens requires the user_id. \n\nSo the user has provided their user ID, so perhaps the get_shareable_api_tokens is the right function, but it's for shareable tokens. The other function might not take user_id. So maybe the user needs to call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens. But the user might also need to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, but without knowing the user_id, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function is for the current user, so if the user is authenticated, it would return their tokens. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is the correct one. \n\nIn any case, the user wants all tokens. So the best approach is to call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. Then, if there's another function that can get non-shareable tokens, but based on the given functions, that's the only one. \n\nSo the function call would be CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. But the user might also need to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, but since the parameters don't include user_id, maybe that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function is for the current user, so if the user is authenticated, it would return their tokens. But the user provided their user ID, so perhaps the get_shareable_api_tokens is the correct one. \n\nIn conclusion, the best possible function call is to use get_shareable_api_tokens with the provided user ID and include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens. However, the user might need to call another function if there are non-shareable tokens, but based on the given functions, that's the only one available."}

The required parameter is experience_or_education_type, and the name is optional but should be specified here as 'Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. \n\nWait, the parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' have 'experience_or_education_type' as a required field with an enum that includes the education option.
