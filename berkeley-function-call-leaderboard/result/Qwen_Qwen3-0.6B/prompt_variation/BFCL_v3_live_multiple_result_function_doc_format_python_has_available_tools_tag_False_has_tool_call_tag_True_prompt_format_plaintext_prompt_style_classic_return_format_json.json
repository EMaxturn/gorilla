They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned the account number, so maybe the BankStatementOverView function could be used. That function requires bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction_overview. The user provided all these details except the transaction_overview, which is a summary. But the function's parameters don't include a transaction_overview as a parameter. Wait, looking at the function definition, the transaction_overview is a dictionary that's part of the args. But the user hasn't provided that data. \n\nWait, the user's question includes a summary of transactions, but the function parameters don't have a 'transaction_overview' parameter. So maybe the user expects the summary to be generated by another function, but according to the given functions, there's no function that directly provides the transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, etc. But the user hasn't provided the transactions data. \n\nWait, the user mentioned deposits and withdrawals, but the transactions list is not provided. So perhaps the user expects me to generate the transaction summary using the available functions, but I don't have the necessary parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used, but the parameters need to be filled. The user provided the beginning and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. But the function requires transactions as a list. Since the user hasn't provided the transactions, I can't call that function. \n\nSo, the available functions don't include a way to get the transaction summary directly. The BankStatementOverView function can be used to get the overview, but it requires the transaction_overview, which isn't provided. Therefore, the user's request can't be fulfilled with the given functions. \n\nWait, but maybe the transaction_overview is part of the BankStatementOverView's args. Let me check again. The BankStatementOverView function's args include full_name, account_number, account_type, and transaction_overview. But the user hasn't provided the transaction_overview. So even if I try to call it, I can't. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the functions required are not available, or the parameters are missing. But the user wants the overview and a summary. Since the functions don't allow for that, I can't proceed. \n\nWait, but maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used. Let me check its parameters again. The function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, etc. The user provided the balances and amounts, but not the transactions. So even if I try to use the transaction_summary, I need the transactions data. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is that the functions required are not available, or the parameters are missing.

However, the function allows a default for cinema_hall. So maybe I can leave that out. The user just wants movies in Noida, so I should call get_movies with city as 'Noida' and maybe leave cinema_hall as default.

But the user didn't mention a specific hall, so maybe it's okay to omit it. \n\nAlso, the user is asking about movies playing today. The function's movie_date parameter is for a specific date. Since the user is asking about today, I should set movie_date to the current date in India. The current date in India is usually something like '2023-10-05' (assuming today is October 5th, 2023). But the function expects a date in 'DD-MM-YYYY' format. So I need to calculate the current date. However, the user might not know the exact date, so maybe I should use the current date as a default. But the function's parameters require a date, so I need to set it. \n\nWait, the user's question is about movies playing in Noida today.

But the user might not know the exact date, so maybe I should use the current date. However, the function expects a date string. So I should format the current date as 'DD-MM-YYYY'. \n\nSo the steps are: call get_movies with city 'Noida', set movie_date to the current date (as a string), and leave cinema_hall as default.

But they need to specify the parameters. The song is Hillbilly style from 2019, album Gotta Be Me. However, the functions provided don't have parameters for genre, year, or album. Wait, the Music_3_PlayMedia function has parameters for track, artist, device, and album. The default for album is 'any', but the user specified the album as Gotta Be Me.

Wait, looking back, the Music_3_PlayMedia function's parameters include artist, device, and album. The default for album is 'any', but the user specified the album as Gotta Be Me. So maybe the user's request can be fulfilled by using Music_3_PlayMedia with the track as the song title, artist as Hillbilly, album as Gotta Be Me, and device as the user's device. But the problem is that the functions don't have parameters for genre and year. Wait, the Music_3_PlayMedia function's parameters don't include genre or year. So how can I use that function? The user might need to provide the track title, artist, album, and device. But the functions don't have parameters for genre or year. So maybe the user's request can be fulfilled by using Music_3_PlayMedia with the track as the song title, artist as Hillbilly, album as Gotta Be Me, and device as the user's device. But since the functions don't have parameters for genre and year, perhaps the user's request can be handled by using the available functions with the given parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Music_3_LookupMusic function can be used to find songs that match the user's preferences.

So perhaps the user's request can be fulfilled by using Music_3_PlayMedia with the track as the song title, artist as Hillbilly, album as Gotta Be Me, and device as the user's device. But since the functions don't have parameters for genre and year, maybe the user's request can be handled by using the available functions with the given parameters. \n\nWait, the user's question is to \"hear a song\" and they have specific preferences. So the best approach is to use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track as the song title, artist as Hillbilly, album as Gotta Be Me, and device as the user's device. But since the functions don't have parameters for genre and year, maybe the user's request can be fulfilled by using the available functions with the given parameters. \n\nTherefore, the function call would be Music_3_PlayMedia with track, artist, album, and device parameters. The user hasn't provided the track title, so maybe the track is the song they want to play. But since the user hasn't specified the track, perhaps the function can be called with the album and artist as given, and the track as the song title. But since the track isn't provided, maybe the function can be called with the album and artist, and the device as the user's. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's request can be fulfilled by using Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs that match their preferences, but since the functions don't have parameters for genre and year, that might not be possible. \n\nSo the conclusion is that the user's request can be fulfilled by using Music_3_PlayMedia with the track as the song title, artist as Hillbilly, album as Gotta Be Me, and device as the user's device. Since the functions don't have parameters for genre and year, but the user provided the album and artist, perhaps that's sufficient.

The parameters for Payment_1_MakePayment are:\n\npayment_method (str): The payment source to use for the transaction, such as a balance within the app or a linked bank card.\n\nSo the function requires payment_method as a parameter. The user didn't specify it, but maybe they assume it's a linked card. However, the function's parameters don't have a 'payment_method' field. Wait, no, the parameters are:\n\npayment_method (str, default=False): A flag indicating whether the transaction should be hidden from public transaction feeds.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Wait, looking at the function definition again:\n\nThe Payment_1_MakePayment function's parameters are:\n\npayment_method (str, default=False): A flag indicating whether the transaction should be hidden from public transaction feeds.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The parameters should be:\n\npayment_method (str): The payment source to use for the transaction, such as a balance within the app or a linked bank card.\n\nBut the function's parameter description says it's a flag. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the function's parameters are:\n\npayment_method (str): The payment source to use for the transaction, such as a balance within the app or a linked bank card.\n\nSo the user needs to provide this parameter. Since the user didn't mention it, maybe the function expects it, but the user's message doesn't include it. However, the user's question says \"using my debit card\", implying that the payment_method is set to 'debit'. But the function's parameters don't have a 'payment_method' field. Wait, no, the function's parameters do have a 'payment_method' field. Let me check again:\n\nThe Payment_1_MakePayment function's parameters:\n\npayment_method (str, default=False): A flag indicating whether the transaction should be hidden from public transaction feeds.\n\nWait, that's not correct.

Since the user's message doesn't include it, but the question is about initiating a transaction, perhaps the function expects it. However, the user's message doesn't mention it. Therefore, maybe the function can be called with the given parameters, even if some are missing. But the user's question doesn't specify the payment_method. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user assumes that the payment_method is set to 'debit' or another value. But since the function requires it, and the user didn't provide it, perhaps the function can't be called without it.

However, the function's parameters include payment_method as a string.

Since the user's message doesn't include it, but the question is about initiating a transaction, perhaps the function can be called with the given parameters, even if some are missing. Therefore, the correct function call is to use Payment_1_MakePayment with amount 90, receiver Alice, and private_visibility set to false (assuming the default is false). But the user's message doesn't mention private_visibility. However, the function's default is false, so maybe it's okay. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n{\"function\":\"Payment_1_MakePayment\",\"parameters\":{\"amount\":\"90\",\"receiver\":\"Alice\"}}\n</TOOLCALL>"}

The available functions are Hotels_2_BookHouse, Hotels_2_SearchHouse, Trains_1_GetTrainTickets, and Trains_1_FindTrains. The user is asking about train tickets, so Trains_1_GetTrainTickets seems right.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The user provided _from as Portland, OR, to as Seattle, WA, date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, but the start time is one day before. Wait, the date is May 15, so the start time would be May 14. But the function's date_of_journey is in the format 'MM/DD/YYYY', so May 15 would be 15/05/2023. The start time is one day before, so that's 14/05/2023. But the function's journey_start_time is in 24-hour format. So the start time would be 13:00 (since 14:00 is 2 PM, but one day before May 15 is 14:00). Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before\", so the date is May 14, 2023. So the date_of_journey is May 14, 2023. The function's date_of_journey is in the format 'MM/DD/YYYY', so that's 05/14/2023. The journey_start_time is 13:00 (since May 14, 2023, 13:00 is 1 PM). \n\nThe user wants 4 adults, business class, trip protection included. The number_of_adults is 4, which is between 1 and 5.

So set _class to 'business'.\n\nSo the function call should be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with those parameters. Let me check if all required parameters are present. The user provided all necessary info: from, to, date, start time, adults, trip protection, and class. So yes, that's all needed. No missing parameters. So the correct function call is to use Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with those values."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and includes revoked tokens. But the user hasn't mentioned revoked tokens, so maybe I should default to include_revoked=False. But the user might just want all tokens, so maybe I should check if they want to include revoked. However, the user's message is just asking for all tokens, so perhaps I should call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked=False. But wait, the other function, api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, also requires include_expired and page and page_size. But the user hasn't specified page size or page number. So maybe I should call get_api_tokens with default parameters. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe get_api_tokens is the right one. However, the user might not have provided page details, so perhaps just call get_api_tokens with default parameters. But the user's question is about all tokens, so maybe get_api_tokens is the function to use. But the user's message is just asking for all tokens, so maybe the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=False and page=1 and page_size=20. But the user hasn't specified page size, so maybe the default is okay. Alternatively, maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is more appropriate here. Wait, the user's question is \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So they want all tokens, but the functions available are get_shareable_api_tokens and get_api_tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens might be for shareable tokens, while get_api_tokens is for all tokens. So perhaps the correct function is get_api_tokens. But the user's user ID is 12345, so I need to call get_api_tokens with user_id 12345. But the parameters for get_api_tokens include include_expired, page, and page_size. Since the user hasn't specified page details, maybe I should use default values. So the function call would be to get_api_tokens with user_id 12345, include_expired=False, page=1, page_size=20. But the user might not have provided page details, so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is for shareable tokens, which might not include all tokens. But the user is asking for all tokens, so perhaps the correct function is get_api_tokens. Therefore, the answer would be to call get_api_tokens with user_id 12345."}
