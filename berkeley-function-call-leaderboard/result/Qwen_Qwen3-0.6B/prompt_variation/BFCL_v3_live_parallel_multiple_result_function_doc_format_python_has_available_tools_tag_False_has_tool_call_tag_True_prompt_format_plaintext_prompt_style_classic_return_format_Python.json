There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri for changing drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function can handle this. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, and specialInstructions. The default for newIngredients is an empty string, so I should specify \"without anchovies\" there. The specialInstructions might not be required, but maybe the user wants to mention it, so I'll include it as a default.\n\nThen, for the drink order, the user provided drink_id 123 and new_preferences. The ChaDri function takes drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences should include \"regular sweetness\" and \"almond milk\". So I need to call ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id 123 and the new_preferences dictionary.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

First, they want to clone a Git repository from GitHub. The command given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. Since the user didn't specify the destination or other parameters, I'll use the default values. So, the first function call should be clone_repo with the provided URL.\n\nNext, the user wants to analyse the repo's contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes a directory_name. The user mentioned \"analyse the contents,\" so I'll use the default directory, which is likely the root of the repo. But wait, the user's steps mention creating a dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs after that. So after cloning, I need to call analyse_repo_contents on the cloned directory. The directory here would be the same as the original repo, but maybe the user expects the directory to be the same as the cloned one. However, the function's parameter is directory_name, so I'll use the cloned directory name. But the user's initial step was cloning, so maybe the directory is the same. I need to make sure the function is called with the correct directory.\n\nThen, the user wants to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. After analysing, I should call that. Similarly, create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user hasn't provided all these details, so I need to use defaults where possible. For example, deployment_name defaults to the directory name, image_name to 'latest', etc. But the user's steps mention creating these after the analysis, so I need to call those functions.\n\nAdditionally, the user says to add all changed files to Git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The user hasn't provided these, so I'll use default values. The commit message defaults to 'Update changes', branch to 'main', force_push to False.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo using clone_repo.\n2. Analyze the repo using analyse_repo_contents.\n3. Create Dockerfile using create_a_docker_file.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs using create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n5. Push changes using push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called with the correct parameters. Let me check each function's parameters again to ensure they're correctly applied. For example, in step 2, the directory_name is the cloned directory. But the user's initial step was cloning, so maybe the directory is the same. However, the function's parameter is directory_name, so I should use the cloned directory name. But the user's initial step didn't specify the destination, so the default is used. So the first function call is correct.\n\nNow, I need to format each function call in the <TOOLCALL> section. Each step should be a separate function call. Let me structure them properly."}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the get_relevant_classes function seems relevant. The parameters for that function include a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string here should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case sensitivity is default, so maybe that's okay. Including subdirectories is optional, but the user wants that, so I'll set include_subdirectories=True.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. For 'setCellValue', the method is 'setCellValue', and for 'getCellValue', it's 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is default False, but the user might need to check if private methods are included. However, the error message says 'getNumericValue()' is missing, which might be a different method. Wait, the user is overriding methods in 'AbstractCellHandler', so maybe the get_signature is for the methods they're overriding. So I need to call get_signature for both methods.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with method names 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. Also, check if the parameters are correct. The get_relevant_classes function's include_subdirectories is optional, but the user wants it, so include_subdirectories=True. The get_signature function's include_private is default False, but maybe the user wants to include private methods, so maybe set include_private=True? But the error message doesn't mention that. Hmm, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()', which might be a different method. But the user is overriding methods in 'AbstractCellHandler', so perhaps the get_signature is for those methods. So I'll proceed with the given parameters."}
