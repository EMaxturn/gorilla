Do I need to adjust that? The function's example uses 'no peanuts' or 'extra spicy', and the note says comma with no space.

Since the default for movie_date is the current date, I don't need to set it explicitly. The city is Mumbai. No cinema hall, language, or format filters mentioned. So I should call get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date as today. But wait, the system note says to default the movie date to current date in India. The function's default is None, but the system should handle that. However, the function's parameter has a default of None, but the user says \"today\", so maybe it's better to set movie_date to today's date in India's timezone.

Wait, the function's movie_date parameter's default is None, but the description says default is current date. Maybe the function handles that. But the system message says to default to current date in India. So perhaps the function's default is already set to current date, so I can just pass city='Mumbai' and omit movie_date.

However, the system note says to default to current date in India, so maybe the function is designed to handle that. Therefore, the correct call is get_movies(city='Mumbai').

Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city and an optional date parameter. The city is provided as Rutherford, NJ. The date needs to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user specified April 22nd, 2023, which converts to '2023-04-22'. So I should call the function with city='Rutherford, NJ' and date='2023-04-22'. The default date is 2019-03-01, but since the user provided a specific date, I need to use that. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. No other functions are available, so this should be the correct call."}

Since the user specified the director as James Gray, I should set directed_by='James Gray'. The genre and cast aren't mentioned, so I'll leave them as default. I need to make sure the function is called correctly with just the director parameter. Let me structure the tool call accordingly."}
