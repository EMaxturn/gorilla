The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: the game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I need to call store_price with these parameters. \n\nWait, the region is optional in the function, but the user specified the United States, so I should include it. The function's default is United States, but since the user explicitly mentions it, including it makes sense. \n\nI don't see any other functions that would help here. The on_sale function checks if a game is on sale, but the user is asking about the cheapest price, which might be on sale. However, the store_price function should return the current price, which would include any sales. So the correct approach is to call store_price with the given parameters. \n\nNo parameters are missing. The platform is PlayStation, region is United States, and game title is provided.

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, both integers.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which is already accounted for since it's starting from rest. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're the same gas, the formula simplifies to (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2). Wait, is that right? Let me think. For ideal gases, the internal energy depends on temperature and moles. So when mixing, the total internal energy is the sum of each part. So U_total = n1*C*T1 + n2*C*T2. Then the final temperature T_final would be U_total / (n1 + n2) * 1/C. Since C is the same for both, it cancels out. So yes, T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2).\n\nSo the parameters here are quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. The function calculate_final_temperature requires all four parameters. The user provided all of them, so I can call that function. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed here because the question is about temperature, not mass. So the correct function to call is calculate_final_temperature with the given values."}

So if they're rolling two dice, n_rolls should be 2. But the function's description says n_rolls is the number of dice to be rolled. Wait, the function's parameters have 'n_rolls' as optional with default 1. So for two dice, set n_rolls=2. The sides_per_die is not specified, but standard dice have 6 sides.
