Here, we have 'name' and 'email'\n   - database (string, optional): with a default of 'CustomerInfo'. Since the user didn't specify, we can use the default.\n\n The user's request: \n   Update customer with id 43523, setting name to 'John Doe' and email to 'johndoe@email.com'\n\n We have all the required parameters: user_id and update_info.\n\n We will call the function update_user_info with:\n   user_id = 43523 (as an integer)\n   update_info = {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@email.com'}\n   database: we can omit because it has a default, but to be explicit we can set it to 'CustomerInfo' or leave it out? \n   However, the function definition says we must provide user_id and update_info. The database is optional.\n\n But note: the required parameters are only ['user_id', 'update_info']. So we don't have to provide database.\n\n However, the tool call format expects the parameters to be in the function call. Since the database has a default, we can skip it.\n\n But let's check: the function parameters in the provided JSON include:\n   \"properties\": {\n      \"user_id\": ...,\n      \"update_info\": ...,\n      \"database\": ... (with default)\n   }\n   \"required\": ['user_id', 'update_info']\n\n So we can call without database.\n\n However, the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. \n But we have the required parameters.\n\n Therefore, we will make a tool call with:\n   <function name=\"update_user_info\">\n     <param name=\"user_id\" type=\"integer\">43523</param>\n     <param name=\"update_info\" type=\"dict\"> \n        But note: in the tool call, we cannot directly put a dict as a string. We have to represent it in a way that the system can parse.\n\n However, the specification says the type of the parameter must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n For a dict, we can represent it as a JSON string? But the type is dict, so we must represent it as a dict. But the tool call is XML.\n\n Actually, the tool call format expects the value to be provided in a way that the system can parse. Since we are in XML, we cannot directly put a dict.\n\n We must represent the dict in a serialized form? The problem does not specify, but note that the function is in Python 3 syntax.\n\n However, the tool call format we are using is XML, so we have to represent the dict as a string that can be parsed as a dictionary? Or we can use nested elements? \n\n The problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section\" and the format is as shown.\n\n Let me see the example: \n   <function name=\"func_name1\">\n      <param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n      <param name=\"param2\" type=\"type2\">value2</param> \n   ... \n\n How do we represent a dict? \n\n Since the type is dict, we must represent the value in a way that the system can convert to a dict. \n\n We can use a JSON string? But the type is dict, so we should not use a string. \n\n Alternatively, the system might allow nested parameters? But the format does not show that.\n\n This is a challenge. Looking at the example, it only shows simple types. \n\n We must follow the instruction: the type must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n For complex types, we must represent them as a string that can be parsed. \n\n Since the function expects a dict, and we are in XML, we can represent the dict as a JSON string and set the type as 'dict'? But that would be a string.\n\n Alternatively, the system might have a way to represent a dict as an object. \n\n But the instruction does not specify. \n\n However, note that the function is defined with a parameter of type 'dict'. So we must pass a dictionary. \n\n Since we are constrained by the XML format, we can represent the dict as a JSON string and set the type to 'dict'. But that might not be directly parsed.\n\n Another idea: the tool call might be processed by a system that can interpret the value string as JSON when the type is dict. \n\n So we can do:\n   <param name=\"update_info\" type=\"dict\">{\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"johndoe@email.com\"}</param>\n\n But note: the value in the XML tag is a string. We are putting a string representation of the dict.\n\n Alternatively, we could break it down into nested parameters? But the function definition does not allow that.\n\n Since the problem does not specify a nested representation, and the function expects a dict, we will represent the dict as a JSON string and set the type to 'dict'. \n\n However, let me check: the function definition says the type of update_info is a dict. So we are passing a string that must be parsed to a dict? \n\n But wait, the function is in Python 3. How would the system know to parse the string? \n\n We must rely on the system to parse the JSON string when the type is dict.\n\n Alternatively, the system might have a different representation? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we must use the provided types, I think using a JSON string for the dict is acceptable.\n\n But note: the type field is for the expected type, and the value is a string that represents that type.\n\n So for the update_info, we do:\n   value: a string that is the JSON representation of the dictionary.\n\n Example: \n   {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"johndoe@email.com\"}\n\n However, we must be cautious: the string must be properly escaped? But the XML tag content must escape special characters.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a CDATA section? But the format doesn't specify.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we are in a simulated environment, we will use the JSON string without escaping (assuming the values do not have special XML characters). \n\n But to be safe, we can escape the necessary characters. However, the values are simple: no quotes or ampersands? \n   'John Doe' -> safe\n   'johndoe@email.com' -> safe\n\n So we can write the string as is.\n\n Therefore, the tool call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"update_user_info\">\n  <param name=\"user_id\" type=\"integer\">43523</param>\n  <param name=\"update_info\" type=\"dict\">{\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"johndoe@email.com\"}</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function also has an optional parameter 'database'. We can skip it because it has a default.\n\n However, if we want to be explicit, we can include it. But the user didn't specify, so we use the default.\n\n Since the function has a default, we don't have to include it.\n\n But the problem says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. \n The required parameters are only user_id and update_info. So we are safe.\n\n Alternatively, if the system expects the default to be used, we don't need to pass it.\n\n So we will only pass the two required parameters.\n\n However, note that the function definition includes the database parameter with a default. We are not required to pass it.\n\n Therefore, we will only pass user_id and update_info.\n\n But wait: the update_info parameter is a dict. We are representing it as a string in the XML. How will the system know to parse it as a dict? \n We are setting the type to \"dict\", so the system should parse the string as a JSON object to get the dict.\n\n This is a common practice.\n\n So the final tool call:"}

But we have common knowledge that the law of universal gravitation is in the \"Principia\". \n But the function requires the work_title. Since the user did not specify, we must use our knowledge to infer the most likely title.\n\n Since the function requires the work_title, and we don't have it from the user's question, we have two options:\n 1. We can assume the common title and proceed.\n 2. Alternatively, we might need to note that the user did not specify the work title and hence we cannot proceed.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But note that we are allowed to use common knowledge? The instructions don't specify.\n\n But note: the function description says: \"Fetches the year a particular scientific work was published.\" and requires the work_title.\n\n Since the user asked for the \"law of universal gravitation\", that is not the title of the work.

We are only allowed to call the function once? And we have to do it in the format.\n\n Alternatively, we could try with the abbreviation?
