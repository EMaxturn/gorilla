Wait, the parameters for location is a single string. So I need to make two separate calls: one for Berlin and one for Paris. The date is next Friday, which I should format as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The genre is classical. The amenities include parking, which is in the enum. The default is parking, but since the user explicitly mentions parking, I should include it. So each call will have location as Berlin or Paris, date as next Friday, genre classical, and amenities with parking. Let me confirm the date.

I'll use the math.hcf function for that. The parameters are number1=45 and number2=60. So that's the first function call.\n\nNext, take the result from the first HCF and find the HCF with another pair (90, 120). Wait, the result of the first HCF is needed here.

Hmm, maybe they mean take the result from the first HCF (which is 15) and then find the HCF of that result with each of 90 and 120? Or is it the HCF of the pair (90, 120) using the previous result? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe user says: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe after getting HCF(45,60)=15, then find HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120)? Or perhaps HCF of (90, 120) using the previous result? Wait, the wording is ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe they want to take the result of the first HCF (15) and then find the HCF of that with the pair (90, 120). But HCF of 15 with 90 and 120? Or HCF of 90 and 120, then HCF of that with the previous result? Hmm. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe the result from the first HCF (15) is used as one number, and then the pair (90, 120) is the other numbers. Wait, but HCF is between two numbers. So perhaps the user wants HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120)? Or maybe HCF of the pair (90, 120) and then HCF of that result with the previous result? The wording is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF(45,60) = 15, then HCF(15, 90) = 15, and HCF(15, 120) = 15. But the way the question is phrased, it's a bit confusing. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nThen, the user also asks to find the HCF of (36, 48) and then use that result to find the HCF with (72, 96). So similar structure. So first compute HCF(36,48) which is 12, then compute HCF(12, 72) and HCF(12, 96)? Or HCF of (72,96) and then HCF of that with 12? Again, the wording is ambiguous. But the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (72, 96)\". So similar to the first part, perhaps the result from HCF(36,48) is 12, then find HCF(12, 72) and HCF(12, 96)? Or HCF of (72,96) and then HCF of that with 12? \n\nBut the user might be asking for multiple steps. Let me parse the entire question again:\n\n1. Calculate HCF of (45,60) \u2192 result A.\n2. Use result A to find HCF with another pair (90,120) \u2192 maybe HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120)? Or HCF of (90,120) and then HCF of that with A? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (A, 90) and HCF of (A, 120)? But the wording is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (45,60) and then HCF of (90,120) using the same method, but that's not using the previous result. \n\nWait, the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So perhaps the result from the first HCF (15) is used as one number, and then the pair (90, 120) is the other numbers. But HCF is between two numbers. So maybe the user wants to compute HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120)? Or HCF(15, 90, 120)? But the function only takes two numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (90, 120) and then HCF of that result with the previous result (15). So first HCF(45,60)=15, then HCF(90,120)=30, then HCF(15,30)=15. But the user's wording is not clear. \n\nThis ambiguity makes it challenging. However, given the function provided is math.hcf which takes two numbers, I need to make sure that each call is between two numbers. \n\nLet me proceed step by step as per the user's instructions, even if the exact meaning is unclear. \n\nFirst part: HCF(45,60) \u2192 call function with number1=45, number2=60. \n\nThen, use that result (which is 15) to find HCF with another pair (90,120). Since the function takes two numbers, perhaps the user wants to compute HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120). But the user says \"another pair of numbers (90, 120)\", which is a pair. So maybe the user wants to compute HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120)? Or perhaps HCF(90, 120) and then HCF of that with 15? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (90, 120) using the previous result. But that's unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended to compute HCF(45,60) = 15, then HCF(15, 90) = 15, and HCF(15, 120) = 15. Then, for the next part, HCF(36,48)=12, then HCF(12,72)=12 and HCF(12,96)=12. \n\nBut the user's exact wording is: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe the result from the first HCF (15) is used as one number, and the pair (90, 120) is the other numbers. But since HCF is between two numbers, perhaps the user wants to compute HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (90, 120) and then HCF of that result with the previous result (15). So first HCF(45,60)=15, then HCF(90,120)=30, then HCF(15,30)=15. \n\nBut the user's wording is not clear. However, given the function only takes two numbers, I need to make sure that each call is between two numbers. \n\nLet me proceed with the first interpretation: after getting HCF(45,60)=15, then compute HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120). Then, for the next part, HCF(36,48)=12, then HCF(12,72) and HCF(12,96). \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. math.hcf(45,60)\n2. math.hcf(15,90)\n3. math.hcf(15,120)\n4. math.hcf(36,48)\n5. math.hcf(12,72)\n6. math.hcf(12,96)\n\nBut the user's question might have intended different steps. However, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with these steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF(45,60) and then HCF(90,120) using the same method, but that's not using the previous result. \n\nBut the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\".

The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I don't need to worry about missing info. \n\nSo, two function calls: one for 2015 with species true, another for 2020 with species true. That should cover both requests."}

The user wants to calculate the return on investment for each of the three stocks they sold. They provided the purchase prices, sale prices, and dividends for each. The function available is calculate_return_on_investment, which takes purchase_price, sale_price, and dividend.\n\nFirst, I need to check if all required parameters are provided. The required ones are purchase_price and sale_price, which the user gave for each stock. Dividend is optional with a default of 0, but the user specified $20, $30, $40 for each respectively. So for each stock, I need to call the function with the corresponding values.\n\nStock 1: purchase_price 150, sale_price 180, dividend 20.\nStock 2: purchase_price 200, sale_price 210, dividend 30.\nStock 3: purchase_price 250, sale_price 300, dividend 40.\n\nEach stock is a separate call to the function. So I should create three function calls with these parameters. Let me make sure the parameters are integers as specified. Yes, all values are integers. No missing parameters. So the answer should be three JSON objects in a list."}

I need to call the function with these values.\n\nSecond equation:5x\u00b2 -4x +1 =0. Here, a=5, b=-4, c=1. Again, use the same function with these parameters.\n\nWait, the function requires all three parameters. The user provided all necessary values for both equations.

So I'll call public_library.find_nearby with location \"New York, NY\" and facilities [\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"].\n\nNext, Los Angeles, CA needs Wi-Fi and Children Section. So the parameters would be location \"Los Angeles, CA\" and facilities [\"Wi-Fi\", \"Children Section\"].\n\nLastly, Chicago, IL requires a Cafe and Reading Room. That's location \"Chicago, IL\" and facilities [\"Cafe\", \"Reading Room\"]. \n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the right parameters. All required parameters are present, so no issues there. Three separate function calls should cover all the user's queries."}
