The user wants to use the data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model predicting future sales. They mentioned x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Also, they want to calculate and return the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data. The data_loading function is available. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The file is dataset.csv, so the file_path should be that. Delimiter is optional, but since the user didn't specify, maybe we can leave it out or use the default. But the function requires file_path, so I'll include that.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function takes x, y, and return_residuals. The user wants to calculate residuals, so return_residuals should be true.\n\nWait, but the data is already loaded into data structure. So the x and y arrays would be data['sales'] and data['future_sales']. But the function parameters require x and y as arrays. So I need to extract those columns from the loaded data.\n\nBut the problem is, the function's parameters are x and y as arrays. So when calling the function, I need to pass the arrays. However, the data_loading function's output is the data structure, but the user hasn't specified how the data is structured. Assuming that the data is loaded into a variable called 'data', then x would be data['sales'] and y would be data['future_sales'].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1.

Then call linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], return_residuals=True.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified the delimiter, so maybe we can assume it's comma.

However, the functions don't mention averaging. Wait, the functions just retrieve the price of each sculpture. So maybe the user wants the average of the two prices. But the functions don't have a function to calculate the average. So perhaps the user expects to call get_artwork_price twice and then compute the average. But according to the instructions, I can only call the functions provided. So I need to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then maybe combine the results. But the system might not allow combining results unless there's a function for that. Since the user's question is about average price, but the functions don't have a function to calculate average, maybe the answer is to call the two functions and then state the average. However, the user's question is phrased as \"average price\", but the functions only return individual prices. So perhaps the answer is to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture and then compute the average. But since the system can't do that, maybe the user expects the two function calls. But the user's question is to get the average, but the functions don't support that. However, the user might not know that, so the assistant should call the functions for each sculpture and then present the average. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return the function calls.

John has three different investment options, and he wants to calculate the returns for each using the provided functions. Let me break down each option and see which function to use.\n\nFirst, the first option is a simple interest scheme with a principal of $5000, a duration of 5 years, and an annual rate of 4%. The calc_Simple_Interest function seems appropriate here. The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. All three are provided, so I can call that function.\n\nNext, the second option is compound interest with the same principal of $5000, 5 years, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually. The calc_Compound_Interest function is for compound interest. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq would be 1. So I need to include that.\n\nThird, the third option is an initial investment of $3000 at 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. Here, the future_value function might be better because it's for calculating future value, which includes compounding. The parameters for future_value are initial_investment, interest_rate, time, and num_compoundings. The initial_investment is $3000, interest_rate is 5% (so 0.05 as a decimal), time is 6 years, and num_compoundings is 2.

First, they want the function of ATP in mitochondria with a specific function. The cell_biology.function_lookup function seems right here. The parameters are molecule, organelle, and specific_function. So I'll set molecule to ATP, organelle to mitochondria, and specific_function to true.\n\nNext, they asked for the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle that. The parameters are origin, destination, and unit. The user specified miles, so unit should be miles. I need to make sure the origin and destination are correctly set as \"New York\" and \"Los Angeles\".\n\nThen, the user wants who credited the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes a discovery parameter. The discovery here is \"theory of relativity\", so I'll use that.\n\nFinally, the price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function requires brand, model, and finish. The brand is Fender, model is Stratocaster, and finish is sunburst. So I'll input those parameters.\n\nI need to check if all parameters are provided. For the first three functions, the required parameters are present. The driving distance function's unit is optional, but the user specified miles, so it's included. All other functions have the necessary parameters. So I'll call all four functions in order."}

The user has a few tasks here. First, they want to modify the painting's attributes. The original painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant color. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil medium, and red color. So I need to call the modify_painting function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant over 100 years using the Darwin model. The prediction.evolution function is needed here. The parameters are species, years, and model. So species is \"African elephant\", years is 100, model is \"Darwin\".\n\nThen, the poker probability. They want the probability of a royal flush in a 52-card deck, with 4 favorable outcomes, rounded to 3 decimal places. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. So total_outcomes is 52*48 (since each card is unique, but wait, actually, the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5). But the user says \"getting a royal flush\" which is 4 possible outcomes (since there are 4 suits). Wait, the problem says there are 4 possible outcomes. So the favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes would be the number of possible 5-card hands, which is C(52,5). But the user might not need to calculate that, just pass the numbers as given. So the parameters are total_outcomes=52*48*47*46*45 (but wait, the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user says there are 4 possible outcomes for a royal flush. So favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52*51*50*49*48 / 5! = 2,598,960. But the user might not need to calculate that, just pass the numbers as given. Wait, the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user says \"there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush\". So favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 2,598,960. But the function's parameters are integers, so the user might expect us to input those numbers. However, the user might not know the exact total, but the problem states that the result should be rounded to 3 decimal places. So the function will calculate it. So the parameters would be total_outcomes=52*48*47*46*45 (but that's the number of possible 5-card hands, but the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Wait, the function's description says \"Calculate the probability of an event.\" So the total_outcomes is the total number of possible outcomes, and favorable_outcomes is the number of successful outcomes. So in this case, the total_outcomes is the number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52*51*50*49*48 / 5! = 2,598,960. But the user might not know that, but the function requires the parameters. So the user says there are 4 possible outcomes for a royal flush. So favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands. But the user might not have that value. However, the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes, and the total is 52*48*47*46*45 (but that's the number of possible 5-card hands). But the function's parameters are integers, so the user needs to input those numbers. However, the user might not have the exact numbers, but the problem states that the result should be rounded to 3 decimal places. So the function will calculate it. Therefore, the parameters would be total_outcomes=52*48*47*46*45 (but that's a huge number, but the function can handle it). However, the user might not have the exact value, but the problem says to use the given parameters. Wait, the user says \"there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush. You want the result to be rounded to 3 decimal places.\" So the favorable_outcomes is 4, and the total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands. But the user might not know that, but the function requires those parameters. So the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52*48*47*46*45 (but that's 52*48*47*46*45 = 52*48=2496, 2496*47=117, 2496*47=117, 2496*47=117, maybe I should calculate it, but the exact value isn't needed. The function will compute it. So the parameters are total_outcomes=52*48*47*46*45 (but that's 52*48=2496, 2496*47=117, 2496*47=117, maybe I should just pass the numbers as given. But the user might not have the exact value. However, the function's parameters are integers, so the user must provide them. But the user hasn't provided the exact total_outcomes. Wait, the user says \"In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\" So the favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52*51*50*49*48 / 5! = 2,598,960. So the parameters would be total_outcomes=2598960 and favorable_outcomes=4. So the function call would be calculate_probability with those values. Therefore, the three function calls are modify_painting, prediction.evolution, and calculate_probability."}

The user has three main requests here. First, predicting the house price in San Francisco. Second, finding lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. Third, calculating the lottery probability.\n\nStarting with the house price. The user provided area (2000 sq ft), number of rooms (4), year built (1985), and location (San Francisco). The predict_house_price function requires these parameters. So I need to call that function with those values.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The function lawsuit_search needs the entity (Mr. John Doe), county (San Francisco), and state (California, which is the default). The user specified San Francisco county, so I'll include that. The state is optional, but since the user mentioned San Francisco, which is in California, I'll set state to California.\n\nLastly, the lottery probability. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes (1000) and favorable_outcomes (5). The user wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places.

The item_type is optional, but since they specifically asked for fish, I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in 'Fortnite' on 'Playstation' in the 'Asia' region.

The platform is 'Playstation', and the game is 'Fortnite'.\n\nThird, they need details of lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuits_details.find function is the one to use.

The third uses lawsuits_details.find with company, year. The fourth uses calculate_binomial_probability with all given values. All parameters are covered. No missing parameters here. So I'll structure the JSON calls accordingly."}
