Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. It fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The required parameters are game_title and platform, with region being optional and defaulting to US. Since the user specified US, maybe we don't need to include region, but including it would make it explicit. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. But wait, does the function check sales or just the regular price? The description says \"selling price,\" which might include sales. However, the user mentioned \"cheapest,\" so maybe we should also check if it's on sale. \n\nThere's also the video_games.on_sale function to check if the game is on sale. If it is, the store_price might return the sale price. But the user wants the cheapest, so perhaps we need to check both. However, the functions might not allow for comparing multiple prices. Alternatively, maybe the store_price function already returns the lowest available price, including sales. The user's question is about the current selling price, which could be the sale price if it's on sale. \n\nSo, first, I should call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as US. If that returns a price, and if the game is on sale, the price would be lower. But since the user is asking for the cheapest, maybe we need to check if it's on sale first. However, the functions might not require that step. The store_price function might already give the current price, which could be the sale price. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the store_price function gives the regular price, and the on_sale function tells if there's a sale. But the user wants the cheapest, so if it's on sale, the sale price would be cheaper. However, without knowing the regular price, we can't calculate the cheapest. But the functions might not provide the regular price. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the selling price, which could be the current price, whether on sale or not. So the store_price function should return the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available at that moment. Therefore, calling store_price with the given parameters should suffice. \n\nSo the correct function call is video_games.store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going if it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are two functions available. The first one is calculate_acceleration, which needs initial_speed, final_speed, time, and optionally distance. The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which requires distance and time, and initial_speed is optional with a default of 0. \n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The user is asking for the final speed, right? Because they want to know how fast it was going after traveling 20 meters in 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed of an object starting from rest under constant acceleration over a specified distance. But the parameters are distance and time. Wait, that seems odd. Because usually, if you have distance and time, you can calculate average speed, but if it's starting from rest with constant acceleration, the formula would be distance = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2. But the function's parameters are distance and time, and initial_speed defaults to 0. But how does that give the final speed? Because final speed would be a*t, and since a = 2d/t\u00b2, then final speed would be 2d/t. Let me check that.\n\nIf the object starts from rest, then the final speed v = u + at. Since u=0, v = at. The distance s = ut + 0.5at\u00b2, which becomes s = 0.5at\u00b2. Solving for a gives a = 2s/t\u00b2. Then substituting back into v = at gives v = (2s/t\u00b2)*t = 2s/t. So yes, the final speed would be 2s/t. \n\nSo in this case, s is 20 meters, t is 4 seconds. So 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. But the function calculate_speed_from_rest is supposed to calculate that. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires distance and time, which are provided (20 and 4). The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, which matches the scenario. So using calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4 should give the correct final speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user could use calculate_acceleration, but that requires initial_speed, final_speed, and time. But the user doesn't know the final speed, so that's not directly applicable. So the correct function here is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. \n\nWait, but the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have distance as integer and time as integer. The user provided 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. So that's okay. So the function call should be calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4). That should return the final speed. \n\nI think that's the right approach. Let me make sure there's no other function that could be used. The other function is for acceleration, but since the user wants speed, not acceleration, the second function is the correct choice."}

The function provided is calculate_final_temperature, which requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2.\n\nSo, the parameters here would be quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. Since the gas is the same, there's no need to adjust for different molar masses or anything else. The function should handle this by calculating the weighted average based on the quantities. \n\nWait, I should make sure that all required parameters are provided. The function requires all four parameters, and the user has given all of them. So the correct call would be to use calculate_final_temperature with those values. No other functions are needed here because the question is purely about mixing temperatures with quantities. The calculate_mass function isn't relevant here since there's no mention of molar mass or needing to find mass. \n\nSo the final answer should be a single function call with those parameters."}
