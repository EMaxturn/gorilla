Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the 'store_price' function. It requires the game title, platform, and region. The parameters are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of United States). Since the user specified the United States, I can use that. The function should fetch the price. But wait, the user is asking for the cheapest price. Does this function return the current price, or is there a way to check sales? \n\nLooking at the other functions: 'on_sale' checks if a game is on sale. Maybe the game is on sale, which could make it cheaper. But the user wants the cheapest price, so perhaps I need to check if it's on sale first. If it's on sale, then get the price. If not, maybe check the regular price. But the functions available don't directly give the cheapest price; they either check if it's on sale or get the price. \n\nWait, the 'store_price' function might return the current price, which could be the cheapest if it's on sale. Alternatively, maybe the 'on_sale' function can confirm if it's currently discounted. But the user wants the cheapest price, so maybe the answer is to check if it's on sale and then get the price. However, the functions don't allow for comparing different prices. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'store_price' function already gives the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available. So the correct approach is to call 'store_price' with the game title, platform, and region. The parameters are all provided: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So the function call should be store_price with those parameters. The user didn't mention anything about sales, but the cheapest price might be the current price, which could be on sale. So the answer is to call store_price with those parameters."}

The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So that's perfect.\n\nI should check if there are any other functions that might be relevant, but the other ones are for squares and circles. Since the question is about a rectangle, the rectangle function is the right choice. The parameters are provided, so I can call the function with side=7 and length=10. Wait, the parameters are named 'width' and 'length', so I need to make sure I use those exact names. \n\nSo the correct function call would be geometry_rectangle.calculate with width=7 and length=10.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem statement since it starts from rest. So I should use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't needed here because we're not given initial and final speeds or time, but the user is asking for speed, not acceleration.

The elements are the list of names. So I need to call sort_list with elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order='asc'. Wait, since the default is already 'asc', maybe I can omit the order parameter.

But wait, the function's parameters have n_rolls as optional with a default of 1. So I need to set n_rolls=2. Let me make sure. The function's required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die.
