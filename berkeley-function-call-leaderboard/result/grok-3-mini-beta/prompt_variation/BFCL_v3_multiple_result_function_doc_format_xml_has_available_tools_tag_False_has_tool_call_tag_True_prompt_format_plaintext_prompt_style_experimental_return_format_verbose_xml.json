It allows deletion or addition of columns. The operation can be 'delete', and I need to specify the columns to delete.\n\n   - Parameters:\n     - db_name: \"employees\" (from the user's message)\n     - table: \"personal_data\"\n     - operation: 'delete'\n     - columns: An array of column names, like [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] (I'm assuming these are the column names based on the description)\n\n2. **database.create_backup**: This is for creating a backup before modification, which is a good practice to avoid data loss.\n\n   - Parameters:\n     - db_name: \"employees\"\n     - backup_location: I need a file path. The user didn't specify one, so I might need to assume or use a default. But the function requires it, so I should include it.\n     - timestamp: Optional, I can set it to true for safety.\n\nThe user didn't provide a backup location. The instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\" But I need to make function calls if possible. For database.create_backup, backup_location is required, so I can't call it without a value.\n\nIn the response format, I must only return the <TOOLCALL> section if I'm calling functions. If I can't, I should return an empty list and explain, but the instructions emphasize to only return the function calls in that format.\n\nThe exact instruction: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nAlso: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nI should first create a backup before modifying, as it's a best practice. But since backup_location is required and not provided, I can't call that function.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, all parameters are provided based on the user's message:\n\n- db_name: employees\n\n- table: personal_data\n\n- operation: delete\n\n- columns: [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] (assuming these names)\n\nI can proceed with calling database.modify_columns directly, but ideally, I should backup first.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\" But for modify_columns, I have all parameters.\n\nPerhaps I can call both, but I need a backup_location. I might need to assume one or note that it's missing.\n\nThe prompt insists on not including other text, so I should only call what I can.\n\nMaybe I should just call database.create_backup with a placeholder, but that's not right. The function requires a valid string.\n\nIn a real scenario, I might prompt for it, but according to the rules, I have to work with what's given.\n\nThe best approach: Since I can call database.modify_columns with the available info, I should do that. For backup, since I lack backup_location, I shouldn't call it.\n\nTo be thorough, I could call database.create_backup first if I assume a location, but I shouldn't assume.\n\nThe instructions: \"If the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\" But for which function? Per function, I think.\n\nThe overall response should be just the <TOOLCALL> or nothing.\n\nPerhaps I need to return an empty list if I can't fulfill completely, but I can partially fulfill.\n\nThe prompt says: \"return an empty list then explain\" only if none can be used.\n\nSince database.modify_columns can be used, I should call it.\n\nSo, plan: First, if I were to backup, but I can't, so just proceed to modify.\n\nI should call database.create_backup with a default location. But that's not specified.\n\nIn the function description, it's required, so I need to provide it. For this exercise, I can use a string like \"/backups/employees_backup\".\n\nThat might be acceptable.\n\nTo be safe, I'll include both calls, assuming a backup location.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Call database.create_backup with db_name=\"employees\", backup_location=\"some_path\", and timestamp=true.\n\n2. Then call database.modify_columns.\n\nIn one response, I can call multiple functions.\n\nSo, in the <TOOLCALL>, I can have multiple <function> elements.\n\nFinal decision: Call both.\n\nFor backup_location, I'll use \"/backups/employees\".\n\nColumns: The user said \"email addresses and social security numbers\", so likely columns named \"email\" and \"social_security_number\" or similar. I'll assume \"email\" and \"ssn\".\n\nSo, functions to call:\n\n- First: database.create_backup with db_name=\"employees\", backup_location=\"/backups/employees\", timestamp=\"true\"\n\n- Second: database.modify_columns with db_name=\"employees\", table=\"personal_data\", operation=\"delete\", columns=[\"email\", \"ssn\"]\n\nOutput in the exact format."}

But to be precise, I should call it with the parameters available.\n\nI could make a call to **game_rewards.get** with game and platform, and let mission and trophy default, which might give a general overview.\n\nThat might not fully answer \"for different missions and trophies\".\n\nPerhaps the best first step is to list the missions using **game_missions.list**, and then in subsequent turns, use that to call **game_rewards.get**.\n\nSince I need to output functions now, I'll start with that.\n\nThe function **game_rewards.get** allows specifying mission and trophy, so if I knew them, I could call it directly. But I don't, so I need to get the missions first.\n\nThe user might expect me to call **game_rewards.get** directly.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check if I can call **game_rewards.get** without mission and trophy. It might work and return general info.\n\nThe function description: \"Retrieve information about different types of rewards that you can receive when playing a certain game.\" And mission and trophy are optional.\n\nSo, perhaps calling it with just game and platform will give rewards information, possibly including for missions and trophies.\n\nTo match the user's request precisely, I should first get the missions.\n\nI need to decide what to do in this turn.\n\nI think the safest is to first call **game_missions.list** for Fortnite, so I can then use that to query rewards.\n\nOnce I have the missions, in the next turn, I can call **game_rewards.get** for each.\n\nThe system might provide the results after each call.\n\nPerhaps I can call **game_rewards.get** with game and platform, and specify a mission if I assume one, but I don't know any.\n\nAnother idea: The user said \"with different missions and trophies\", but didn't list them, so maybe calling **game_rewards.get** once with defaults is a start.\n\nI should output a function call for **game_rewards.get** with the required parameters and leave the optionals out.\n\nLet me try to formulate it.\n\nRequired: game=\"Fortnite\", platform=\"Playstation\"\n\nOptional: mission=\"\", trophy=\"\"\n\nIf I set them to empty strings, as per default.\n\nIn the function call format, I only need to include the params I'm using, but since they have defaults, I can omit them.\n\nLooking at the format: <param name=\"param\" value=\"value\" type=\"type\"/>\n\nI should only include the required ones if that's all I need.\n\nThe example in the prompt includes only the necessary params.\n\nSo, for **game_rewards.get**, I can call it with just game and platform.\n\nThat might be sufficient for the first call.\n\nTo fully answer, I might need multiple calls, but I'll start with one.\n\nPerhaps the system expects me to make one call per response.\n\nI think I'll go with calling **game_rewards.get** with game and platform, and perhaps add a mission if I knew one, but I don't.\n\nThere's **game_missions.list**, so maybe I should call that first.\n\nLet's think about the user's request: \"Find out the rewards for playing Fortnite on Playstation platform with different missions and trophies\"\n\nTo get rewards for different missions, I need to know what missions there are.\n\nSo, step 1: Call **game_missions.list** for Fortnite.\n\nThen, once I have that, I can call **game_rewards.get** for each mission.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nMy first response should be to call **game_missions.list**.\n\nAfter that, in the next turn, based on the result, I can call **game_rewards.get**.\n\nAlright, so I'll output the TOOLCALL for **game_missions.list**.\n\nParameters: only game=\"Fortnite\"\n\nSo, the function call will be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"game_missions.list\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"game\" value=\"Fortnite\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nYes."}

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nAnd earlier: \"If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\" But then it says not to include other text.\n\nLooking back: \"return an empty list then explain.\" But in the context, it might mean to handle it within the response format. However, the instruction is clear: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any... put it in that format. You SHOULD NOT include any other text.\"\n\nFor cases where no function is called, I need to return an empty <TOOLCALL> or something? The prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, return an empty list then explain.\" But then contradicts by saying not to include other text.\n\nPerhaps it's: In the <TOOLCALL> section, if no functions, return an empty list, like <TOOLCALL></TOOLCALL>, and then explain outside, but no, it says \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nThis is confusing.

The exact wording: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nBut immediately after: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nI think the intention is that the entire response should be just the <TOOLCALL> XML if calling functions, or if not, perhaps an empty one or nothing, but it says \"return an empty list then explain\", which might be a mistake.\n\nIn the prompt: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete...\"\n\nFor this case, since there's no function to query materials, I shouldn't call any function. So, I need to return an empty <TOOLCALL>.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text.\"\n\nImplied is that if not invoking, return nothing or an empty structure.\n\nBut to be precise, it says: \"return an empty list then explain.\" Perhaps in the response, I should have <TOOLCALL><functions></functions></TOOLCALL> or something.\n\nLooking at the format: <TOOLCALL><functions><function>...</function></functions></TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for no functions, perhaps <TOOLCALL><functions></functions></TOOLCALL>\n\nThe user is asking for material options, which isn't directly supported.

Since I can't provide options, maybe I should just proceed with the order as specified.\n\nThe user said: \"I want to order... What material options are available?\"\n\nIt's two parts: express intent to order, and ask for options.\n\nSince I don't have a function for options, I can't answer that. So, perhaps I should not call any function and let the system handle it.\n\nBut the prompt insists on only returning the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to return an empty <TOOLCALL>, like <TOOLCALL><functions></functions></TOOLCALL>\n\nThe user specified: custom bronze sculpture of a horse. So, they already know the material: bronze.\n\nThey say: \"I want to order a custom bronze sculpture of a horse. What material options are available?\"\n\nThey are specifying bronze, but still asking for options. Maybe they want to confirm or choose.\n\nSince the function allows specifying material, I could just call it with bronze.\n\nBut they asked for options, which I can't provide.\n\nTo make progress, I should call the function with the details they provided.\n\nThe prompt: \"try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user\"\n\nThe task is to order, and they mentioned the material, so call the function.\n\nIf I call sculpture.create_custom with item=\"horse\" and material=\"bronze\", that might fulfill the order part.\n\nThen, for the options, I can't do anything.\n\nSo, perhaps call the function.\n\nLet me check if all parameters are available: item=\"horse\", material=\"bronze\", size is optional, so I can omit it.\n\nYes, I can call it.\n\nSo, I think I should make the function call."}

It takes a table name and conditions.\n\n4. **probability_of_event**: This is for calculating probabilities, not relevant.\n\nSo, the only function that fits is **database.query**.\n\nNow, let's look at the parameters for **database.query**:\n\n- **table**: type=\"string\", required=\"true\". Description: Name of the table to query.\n\n- **conditions**: type=\"array\", required=\"true\". Description: Conditions for the query.\n\nThe user specified: \"user table where age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'\".\n\nSo, for **table**, I can use \"user\".\n\nFor **conditions**, it's an array. I need to represent the conditions as an array. The conditions are: age > 25 and job = 'engineer'.\n\nI should format this as an array. Probably something like [{\"age\": {\">\": 25}}, {\"job\": \"engineer\"}].\n\nThe function description doesn't specify the exact format of the array, but based on common query practices, it's likely an array of objects or strings that represent the conditions.\n\nIn the tool description, it's just \"conditions\" as an array, so I'll assume it's an array of condition objects.\n\nI need to make sure my response is only the <TOOLCALL> section, in the exact format specified.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n...\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n...\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, I'll have:\n\n- function name: \"database.query\"\n\n- params:\n\n  - param name=\"table\" value=\"user\" type=\"string\"\n\n  - param name=\"conditions\" value=\"...\" type=\"array\"\n\nWhat should the value for conditions be? Since it's an array, I need to represent it as a string that can be parsed as an array, like a JSON string.\n\nIn the example format, it's <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>, so for an array, I might need to put a string representation.\n\nFor instance, value could be '[{\"field\": \"age\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": 25}, {\"field\": \"job\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}]'\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nI need to ensure all required parameters are provided.\n\nOnce I call this function, that's it for this turn. If more is needed, the system will handle it.\n\nFinally, if I have no functions to call, I should return an empty list, but in this case, I do.\n\nThe instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\" But I must only return the TOOLCALL section, no explanations.\n\nRe-reading: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...

The default is 'scriptures', which is a type of historical record. I could specify \"historical record\" as the source, but that might not be valid. To be safe, I'll use the default unless specified. The function description: \"Source to fetch the reference. Default is 'scriptures'\". Since it's not required, I can omit it to use the default.\n\nThe user might mean non-religious historical records, like Roman histories. However, based on the tools available, I have to work with what's given. So, I'll proceed with calling the function with the name.\n\nMy response should ONLY be the <TOOLCALL> section if I'm making a call. No other text.\n\nAfter this call, if needed, I can make more in subsequent turns, but for now, this seems to fulfill the request.\n\nSo, I'll call **get_earliest_reference** with:\n\n- name: \"Jesus Christ\"\n\n- source: I'll omit it to use the default 'scriptures', as that's the closest match.\n\nFinally, output only the TOOLCALL."}

It gets the musical scale of a specific key.\n\nThe parameters for musical_scale are:\n\n- key: Required, string. This should be \"C sharp major\" or something similar. The description says \"The musical key for which the scale will be found.\" So, for C sharp major, I need to provide the key as \"C# major\" or \"C sharp major\".

The user asked for \"names of proteins\", so I might not need descriptions, but the function could include it if I set it to true.
