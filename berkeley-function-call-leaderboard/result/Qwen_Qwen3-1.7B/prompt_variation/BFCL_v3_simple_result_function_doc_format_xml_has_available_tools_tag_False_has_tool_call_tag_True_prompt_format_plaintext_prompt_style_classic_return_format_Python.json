The preferences mention pet-friendly, so I should include that in the preferences array.\n\nWait, the function's parameters have a preferences array, which is optional. So I need to include the pet-friendly preference. The function's description says it handles additional preferences, so adding that should work.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\nlocation = \"Manhattan, New York\"\nroom_type = \"single\"\nduration = 3\nstart_date = \"2023-03-10\"\npreferences = [\"pet friendly\"]\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The user didn't mention any other preferences, so the preferences array can be set to include \"pet friendly\". The function should handle that.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is hotel_booking with those parameters."}

The user is asking how much 20,000 Japanese Yen is in US Dollars. So they want to convert JPY to USD.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The convert_currency function is there. It requires base_currency, target_currency, and amount. The user provided the amount (20000), but they didn't specify the base currency. Wait, the base currency is JPY, right? Because they're converting from Japanese Yen to USD. So the base_currency should be JPY, target_currency USD, and amount 20000. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are present. The function requires base_currency, target_currency, and amount. The user provided all three: JPY, USD, and 20000. So the function call should be convert_currency with those parameters.
