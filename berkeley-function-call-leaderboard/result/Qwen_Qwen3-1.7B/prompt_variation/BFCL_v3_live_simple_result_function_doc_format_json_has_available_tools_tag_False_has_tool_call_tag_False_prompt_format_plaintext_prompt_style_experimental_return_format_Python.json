The date is given as March 5th 2023, which converts to '2023-03-05' in the required format. \n\nSince the user provided the date, I don't need to use the default. So the function call should be Weather_1_GetWeather with city='Marshall, MN' and date='2023-03-05'. \n\nI should check if there are any other parameters or if the function requires anything else. The description says the function is in Python 3 syntax, but the parameters are as specified. \n\nYes, that's all. The function call should be correct."}
