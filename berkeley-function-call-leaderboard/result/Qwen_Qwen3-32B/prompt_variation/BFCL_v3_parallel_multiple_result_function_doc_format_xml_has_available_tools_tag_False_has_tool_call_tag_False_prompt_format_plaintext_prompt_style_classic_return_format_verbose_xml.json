The function data_loading is for that. The required parameter is file_path, which is \"dataset.csv\".

The data_loading function probably returns a data structure like a dictionary or a DataFrame. Assuming that after loading, data['sales'] and data['future_sales'] are arrays.

The user has three parts to their question. \n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from 5 moles of glucose. The biological.calc_energy function seems right here. The parameters are mols (5) and substance (\"C6H12O6\"). The joules_per_mol is given as 2800 kJ/mol, which matches the default, so maybe it's optional. But since it's specified, I should include it.\n\nSecond, using that energy, calculate the biomass with 10% efficiency. The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. The efficiency here is 10%, so 0.10 as a float.\n\nThird, calculate the work done by the machine with the total energy and 2 meters distance. The physical.calc_work function needs energy (from first step) and distance (2 meters). \n\nWait, but the work calculation uses the total energy, right? The problem says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance\". So yes, use the energy from part one and distance 2m. \n\nSo the steps are: first call calc_energy, then use its result in calc_biomass and calc_work. But since the functions are separate, I need to call each in order. The user wants all three calculations. So first function is calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800. Then calc_biomass with energy=result_of_first, efficiency=0.10. Then calc_work with energy=result_of_first and distance=2. But in the response, I need to list all the function calls in order. The parameters for each function must be specified. Since the user hasn't provided the actual energy value yet, but the first function will compute it, but in the function calls, each is independent. Wait, but the parameters need to be values. Oh, but in the actual system, the functions might be chained, but here I need to output the function calls as per the given parameters. For the first function, all parameters are provided: mols=5, substance is \"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800. Then the second function uses the energy from the first, but since the user hasn't given that yet, but the first function's output is the energy. However, in the function call syntax here, I can only use the parameters provided. Wait, but the user is asking to make the function calls based on the given parameters. For the first step, the parameters are known. The second step uses the result of the first, but in the function call, the energy parameter would be the output of the first function. However, in the current setup, each function call is independent, so the parameters must be specified. But since the user hasn't provided the actual energy value yet, but the first function will compute it, how do I represent that? Wait, maybe the user expects that each function is called with the parameters as given, even if they depend on previous results. So for the first function, we can call it with the known parameters. The second function will use the energy from the first, but in the function call, we can't reference previous results. So perhaps the user expects that the assistant will generate the function calls in sequence, assuming that the output of one is passed to the next. But in the XML format, each function call is standalone. Therefore, the assistant should generate the three function calls in order, with the parameters as specified. For the second function, the energy parameter is the result of the first function, but since the assistant can't compute that, it just includes the parameter as \"energy\" with the value being the output of the first function. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says \"given the energy produced and the conversion efficiency\". So the second function's energy parameter is the output of the first. Similarly, the third function's energy is the same as the first. However, in the function calls, the parameters must be actual values. But since the user hasn't provided the actual energy value, but the first function will compute it, the assistant can't know the exact value. Therefore, the assistant must make the function calls with the parameters as given, even if they are dependent on previous results. So the first function is called with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800. The second function is called with energy (which will be the result of the first function) and efficiency=0.10. The third function is called with energy (same as first function's result) and distance=2. So the assistant needs to generate these three function calls, each with their respective parameters. The parameters for energy in the second and third functions will be the output of the first, but in the XML, they are just parameters. So the assistant should write the three function calls in order, with the parameters as specified. The user's question provides all necessary parameters for each function. For example, the first function has mols=5, substance is given, and joules_per_mol is given. The second function has efficiency=10% (0.10). The third has distance=2. So the assistant can generate all three function calls with the given parameters. The energy parameter for the second and third functions will be the output of the first, but in the function call, the assistant can't know the value yet, so it's just passed as the parameter. Wait, but in the XML format, the parameters must be actual values. Wait, no, the parameters are the inputs to the function. So for the second function, the energy parameter is the output of the first function. But in the function call, the assistant can't know that value yet. Therefore, the assistant must make the function calls in sequence, with the understanding that the output of one is the input to the next. However, in the XML format, each function call is a separate entity. Therefore, the assistant should generate the three function calls, each with their required parameters. The first function's output is energy, which is then used as input for the second and third functions. But in the XML, the parameters for the second and third functions would need to reference the energy value. However, since the assistant can't compute the actual value, it's just passed as a parameter. Therefore, the assistant should generate the three function calls with the parameters as given. The first function is called with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800. The second function is called with energy (which will be the result of the first function) and efficiency=0.10. The third function is called with energy (same as first function's result) and distance=2. So the assistant's response should include all three function calls in order, with the parameters as specified. The parameters for energy in the second and third functions are not known yet, but they are required parameters. Wait, but the user is asking to make the function calls based on the given parameters. The user has provided all necessary parameters for each function. For example, the first function's parameters are all provided. The second function's efficiency is provided (10%), and the energy is the output of the first function. The third function's distance is provided (2 meters), and energy is the output of the first function. Therefore, the assistant can generate the three function calls, each with their respective parameters. The energy parameter for the second and third functions is the output of the first, but in the function call, the assistant can't know the value yet. However, the user is asking to make the function calls, not to compute the actual values. Therefore, the assistant should generate the three function calls with the parameters as given, even if some parameters are dependent on previous results. So the final answer should include all three function calls in order."}

Since the region isn't specified here, maybe it's global by default, but the user didn't mention it, so I'll proceed with the provided details.\n\nLastly, they're asking for reviews of 'FIFA 21' from the American region. The function games.reviews.find requires game and optional region. Here, the region is specified as American, so I'll include that.\n\nI need to make three separate function calls.

The recipe_search function is perfect here. I'll need to input those ingredients and the calorie limit. The meal type is breakfast, so I should include that parameter.\n\nNext, lunch: they want a restaurant that serves chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce dishes under 500 calories. The restaurant_search function fits here. Again, ingredients array and calories are required. Meal type is lunch, so I'll specify that.\n\nFor dinner, they have a recipe with beef but want to replace it with tofu while keeping calories under 600. The ingredient_replace function is needed here. Original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and the calorie limit is 600.\n\nI need to make sure each function's required parameters are met.

The parameters needed are molecule, organelle, and specific_function. So molecule is ATP, organelle is mitochondria, and specific_function should be true.\n\nNext, they want the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle that. The origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles, and unit should be miles since they specified that.\n\nThird, they're asking about the scientist credited for the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes a discovery parameter. The theory of relativity is the discovery here, so that's straightforward.\n\nLastly, the retail price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function requires brand, model, and finish. Brand is Fender, model is Stratocaster, and finish is sunburst.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly filled out. Each function is required to have certain parameters, and the user provided all necessary info. No missing parameters here. Also, check the types. All are strings except specific_function which is a boolean. The unit for distance is specified as miles, which is a string. Everything looks good. Let's structure the function calls in order."}

The user has multiple tasks here. First, they need to modify a painting's attributes. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, and red. The function modify_painting requires size, medium, and optional dominant_color. So I'll call modify_painting with size \"30x40\", medium \"oil\", and dominant_color \"red\".\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of African elephants for 100 years using the Darwin model. The function prediction.evolution needs species, years, and model. So parameters would be species \"African elephant\", years 100, model \"Darwin\".\n\nLastly, calculate the probability of a royal flush. There are 4 favorable outcomes in a 52-card deck. The function calculate_probability takes total_outcomes (52 choose 5, which is 2598960) and favorable_outcomes (4). They also want it rounded to 3 decimals, so round_to 3. Wait, but the function's params are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes as integers. Wait, but total_outcomes here is the number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52C5 = 2,598,960. The favorable is 4. So the probability is 4 / 2598960. Then round to 3 decimals. So the function call would be total_outcomes=2598960, favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For modify_painting, size and medium are required, which are provided. For prediction.evolution, species and years are required, and model is optional. For calculate_probability, total and favorable are required, round_to optional. All required parameters are present. So three function calls in total."}

The user has three main requests: predict the house price, find lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county, and calculate the probability of winning a lottery.\n\nFirst, for the house price prediction, the function predict_house_price is needed. The parameters required are area, rooms, year, and location. The user provided all these: 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, 1985, and San Francisco. So I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The function lawsuit_search requires entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, the county is San Francisco. Since the state isn't specified, it defaults to California, which matches the user's mention of San Francisco, so I can use the function with entity=\"Mr. John Doe\", county=\"San Francisco\".\n\nLastly, the lottery probability. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, with an optional round_to. The user gave 1000 total and 5 favorable, wanting it rounded to 3 decimals. So I'll set total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For the house price, all are there. For lawsuits, entity and county are required, which are provided. The state is optional and defaults to California, which is correct here.
