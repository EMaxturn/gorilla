Each condition can be represented as a tuple (column, operator, value) or in a similar structured way.\n Since the example does not specify the exact structure of the condition, but based on common practices, we can represent:\n   condition for age: ('age', '>', 25)\n   condition for job: ('job', '=', 'engineer')\n\n We can combine these two conditions with an 'AND'? But note the function description says \"conditions\" is a list. \n It is safe to assume that the conditions in the list are ANDed together.\n\n Therefore, we can write:\n   conditions = [('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')]\n\n However, note the function signature: conditions (list). The exact representation might depend on the implementation, but the problem states we are to use the given function.\n\n Let's format the function call accordingly.\n\n Function call: database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])\n\n But note: the function call format must be in the form of a string that we output. We are to output exactly in the format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\n However, the value of conditions is a list of tuples. We must represent it in a way that is valid.\n\n Since the output is a string, we have to write the list as a string. But note that the system will parse this string. We can use a JSON-like representation or Python literal.\n\n The problem says: \"in the format of [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\"\n\n We can represent the list as: [('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')] in a string.\n\n However, the entire function call is a string. So we have to be careful with quotes.\n\n Let's break it down:\n\n   We are going to write: database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])\n\n But note that the string inside the condition for job must be quoted. We are using single quotes for the string, but the entire parameter string might be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes for the inner string to avoid conflict.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact serialization. But note that the example format uses single quotes for the function call representation? Actually, the example format does not specify.\n\n Since the problem says \"in the format of [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\", and the values are to be expressed as in Python, we can use:\n\n   conditions = [('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')]\n\n But we have to represent it as a string. We are going to output a string that looks like:\n\n   [database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])]\n\n However, the inner string 'engineer' must be in quotes. We can use single quotes for the inner string and hope the parser understands.\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes for the inner string and then the entire string representation might be:\n\n   conditions = [(\"age\", \">\", 25), (\"job\", \"=\", \"engineer\")]\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the type of the condition elements. We'll go with double quotes for the inner strings to avoid escaping in case the outer uses single.\n\n However, the example format in the problem uses single quotes for the function parameters? Actually, the example uses: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...)]\n\n The params_value can be any expression? We have to represent the list.\n\n Considering the system that will parse this, it is likely that it will evaluate the string as a Python expression? Or it might be using a safe evaluator.\n\n Since we are not sure, we can try to use a JSON serializable representation? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we can represent the condition list as a list of tuples with double-quoted strings. However, the outer function call uses single quotes for the parameter names? Actually, in the example, it's written without quotes for the keys (because it's like a function call in code).\n\n But note: the entire function call is to be output as a string. We are writing a string that will be parsed.\n\n We have two options:\n\n Option 1: Use single quotes for the entire string and escape the inner single quotes? Not very readable.\n\n Option 2: Use double quotes for the entire string and then use single quotes inside? Or vice versa.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says \"in the format of [func_name(...)]\", and the example uses unquoted parameter names and values without specifying string quotes.\n\n But note: the value for the table is a string, and we wrote it as 'user'. Similarly, the condition list is a list. We can write the condition list as a Python literal.\n\n We'll assume the parser can handle a Python-like literal.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n   [database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])]\n\n However, the inner string 'engineer' is in single quotes. But the entire function call string might be enclosed in double quotes? Actually, we are writing a string that is the function call representation.\n\n But note: the system expects a very specific format. We are to output exactly the function call in the brackets.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact string representation for the condition list, and we are following the Python literal, we do:\n\n   conditions = [('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')]\n\n But we must note: the condition for job has a string value. We have to quote it. We'll use single quotes for the inner strings and hope the parser is flexible.\n\n Alternatively, we can use without quotes for the strings? That would be invalid because 25 is an integer and 'engineer' must be a string.\n\n We have to represent the string with quotes.\n\n Let's try to represent the condition list as a list of tuples with single-quoted strings. But then the entire function call is going to be a string. We are writing:\n\n   \"[database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])]\"\n\n But note: when we write this string, the inner single quotes might cause issues? Actually, we are outputting a string that contains single quotes.\n\n However, the problem says \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and the format is without any extra text.\n\n We are going to output:\n\n   [database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])]\n\n But note: the condition for job: we wrote 'engineer'. However, in the user's request, it's written as 'engineer'. So we use that.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the job condition is for the exact string 'engineer'. We use the equals operator.\n\n Let's write the function call accordingly.\n\n But note: the function call must be exactly as the function name and parameters. The function is called `database.query`, so we write `database.query`.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n   [database.query(table='user', conditions=[('age', '>', 25), ('job', '=', 'engineer')])]"}

Since we don't have the location, we can skip it.\n\n But note: The actual work by Newton that introduced the law of universal gravitation is \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (often shortened to \"Principia\"). \n The user might refer to it as \"law of universal gravitation\", but the function expects the work title. \n\n However, the function description doesn't specify that it must be the exact title. It might handle common names. But to be safe, we can try with both the common name and the exact title?\n\n But the problem: the function only takes one title. We don't know if the function can handle common names. Since the user said \"law of universal gravitation\", we can try that.\n\n Alternatively, we might need to use the exact title. But the user's question doesn't provide the exact title. \n\n Since the function is a black box, we have to use the information we have.\n\n We have:\n   author = \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title = \"law of universal gravitation\"\n\n However, if we know that the common reference might not be in the database, we might also try with the exact title. But we are constrained by the parameters we have.\n\n The instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. But note, we have the required parameters (author and work_title). We don't have the exact title, but we have the title as the user provided.\n\n We'll call the function with the provided title and hope the function can handle it. Alternatively, if we have prior knowledge that the work is commonly known by that phrase, we can use it.\n\n But note: the function might be designed to handle common names. So we try:\n\n Option: call the function with:\n   author = \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title = \"law of universal gravitation\"\n\n However, if we are concerned that the function might not return a result with that title, we might also try the exact title. But the problem is that we are only allowed to use the function as provided, and we don't have the exact title from the user. We must use the information we have.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the user might be referring to the work that is commonly called \"Principia\". But the question doesn't mention that. \n\n Since the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" - we are not lacking the parameters, we have them. So we use the provided title.\n\n Therefore, we will call the function once with the provided title.\n\n But note: the function might return multiple results? The function description doesn't say. We assume it returns the most relevant.\n\n Let's call:\n   publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"law of universal gravitation\")\n\n However, if we have prior knowledge that the exact title is important, we might try to adjust. But the instruction does not allow us to add text. We must output the function call.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the common exact title? But the user didn't provide it. So we must stick to the user's input.\n\n But wait, the user said \"the law of universal gravitation\", which is a concept, not necessarily the title of a book. The book that introduced it is \"Principia\". \n\n However, the function expects a work title. We are taking a risk. But without more functions, we cannot look up the work by concept.\n\n Considering the above, we have two options:\n\n 1. Use the provided phrase and hope the function can map it to the work.\n 2. Use the known title \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" or \"Principia\".\n\n But note: the user did not provide the exact title. We are not supposed to invent parameters. We are to use the given parameters.\n\n However, the function requires the work_title. The work_title in the function is the title of the work. We know that the law of universal gravitation was published in the \"Principia\". So we might use that title. But is that allowed?\n\n The instruction says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\n We are allowed to use our knowledge to interpret the question. We know that the law was published in the Principia. So we can use:\n\n   work_title = \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n But note: the function might not have non-ASCII characters? We can use the common English version: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\" or the short form \"Principia\".\n\n Let's use the short form: \"Principia\" is very common.\n\n However, the function might require the full title? We don't know. We can try with \"Principia\" and hope it matches.\n\n But the instruction does not specify. We have to do our best.\n\n Considering that the function might be designed for common queries, we can try:\n\n Option 1: the title as the user said: \"law of universal gravitation\"\n Option 2: the common title of the book: \"Principia\"\n\n We can try both in two separate calls? The problem says: we can make one or more function calls.\n\n We are allowed to call multiple functions until we have the answer.\n\n So we can try:\n\n First call: with the user's title.\n If that returns nothing (we don't have the result in this step, but the system will run the function and return the result in the next turn), then we try the known title.\n\n But note: the instruction says we should output the function calls in the same response? Actually, the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" and we are to output the function calls in the format without any other text.\n\n However, the system expects one response per turn. So we can output multiple function calls in one response? The example format shows: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\n So we can do two calls in one response.\n\n Alternatively, we can do one call and then in the next turn if it fails do the other? But the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" meaning we should do as much as we can in one turn.\n\n Since we are allowed to output multiple function calls in one response, we can do:\n\n [publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"law of universal gravitation\"), publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Principia\")]\n\n But note: the function might return multiple results for the same author and different titles? We are trying two different titles.\n\n However, the function does not specify that it returns multiple. We assume it returns the best match for the given title.\n\n Alternatively, we can try the full title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", but we don't know if the function has that. We can use the common English version: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\".\n\n But note: the function might be case-sensitive? We don't know. We should use standard capitalization.\n\n However, to be safe, we can try:\n\n   Call 1: work_title=\"law of universal gravitation\"\n   Call 2: work_title=\"Principia\"\n   Call 3: work_title=\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n\n But that might be too many. We don't know if the function is robust.\n\n Alternatively, we can rely on the fact that the function might be designed to handle common names and we try only the user's input first? But the instruction says we should do our best in the current turn.\n\n Considering the above, we decide to try two titles: the one the user gave and the most common short title.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   [publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"law of universal gravitation\"), publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Principia\")]\n\n But note: the function also has an optional parameter 'location'. We don't have it, so we skip it (use default).\n\n However, what if one of the calls returns a result and the other doesn't? The system will run both and we can then choose the one that returns a valid year.\n\n But note: we are only allowed to output the function calls. The system will run them and then we will see the results in the next turn? Actually, we are generating the function calls for the system to execute.\n\n Since we are allowed to make multiple function calls, we do two.\n\n But note: the function might return the same result for both titles? That's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can do one call with the exact known title and skip the user's phrase? Because we know the user's phrase is not the title. \n\n But the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" - that's not the case. We are using the function.\n\n However, we have a conflict: the function requires the work title, and we have two candidates. We are allowed to try multiple.\n\n Let's output two function calls.\n\n Format: [publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"law of universal gravitation\"), publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Principia\")]\n\n But note: the function name is 'publication_year.find', so we write exactly that.\n\n Also note: the parameter names are exactly as in the function definition: 'author', 'work_title', and optionally 'location'. We skip 'location'.\n\n We write:\n\n [publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"law of universal gravitation\"), publication_year.find(author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Principia\")]"}

But the problem states: we are to use the given functions. We don't have a function to list parameters.\n Since the user specifically asks for \"rating\" and \"player count\", we can assume that these are valid parameters? \n But note: the function description does not specify what parameters are available. However, in the context of board games, common parameters might include:\n   - rating: probably the average rating\n   - player count: might be called 'min_players', 'max_players', or perhaps 'players'. But the user says \"player count\", which might be a range.\n\n However, the function's docstring does not specify the exact parameter names. We have to rely on common sense or prior knowledge.\n\n But note: the problem says we are to use the given functions. Since we are not given a function to list available parameters, we must make an educated guess.\n\n Let's assume that the parameters we can request are:\n   - For rating: perhaps \"average_rating\" or \"rating\"\n   - For player count: we might need both \"min_players\" and \"max_players\", or maybe there is a parameter \"player_count\" that returns a string? \n\n Alternatively, we can try to get all the information and then extract? But the function allows us to specify which parameters we want.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact parameter names. Since we are stuck, we can try to get the information by requesting the parameters that seem most likely.\n\n But note: the function might have a fixed set of parameters. Without documentation, we cannot be sure.\n\n Since the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n But in this case, we are not missing parameters for the function call? We have the name and the parameters we are interested in.\n\n However, we are not sure what the exact parameter names are. But the system expects us to use the function.\n\n Let me re-read the function description: it says \"parameters (list): Game characteristics interested.\" - so we must pass a list of strings.\n\n Since we don't have a list of available parameters, we have to try with the ones that make sense.\n\n Common parameters for board games (from BoardGameGeek, for example) might include:\n   - \"average_rating\"\n   - \"minplayers\"\n   - \"maxplayers\"\n\n But note: the function might use different keys.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might expect us to know that the function accepts certain parameters? We are not given that.\n\n Considering the instruction: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But we are using the function.\n\n However, we are not sure about the exact parameter names. This is a problem.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert in composing functions. We must try.\n\n Let's assume the function uses the following parameter names (based on common practice):\n   - For rating: \"average_rating\"\n   - For player count: we might need two parameters: \"min_players\" and \"max_players\", but the user asked for \"player count\", which might be a string or an object. Alternatively, there might be a parameter called \"players\" that returns a string? \n\n Since the user asked for two specific pieces of information, we can try:\n\n Option 1: request two parameters: ['rating', 'player_count'] \n   - But what if the function doesn't have 'player_count'? Then we might not get the player count.\n\n Option 2: request three parameters: ['average_rating', 'min_players', 'max_players'] and then we can combine min and max to form the player count.\n\n But note: the function might not have 'average_rating' but just 'rating'. We are not sure.\n\n Without knowing the exact available parameters, we have to make a best guess.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the available parameters. Therefore, we must rely on the function's documentation? But we don't have it.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I think we should try to get the most common ones.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function might return a fixed set of information regardless of the parameters? But the function has a `parameters` argument, so we can specify.\n\n But the problem states: we are to use the given functions. We have to call it.\n\n Let's try to call with the parameters that are explicitly mentioned in the question: \n   - We are asked for \"rating\" -> so we can try 'rating'\n   - We are asked for \"player count\" -> we can try 'player_count'\n\n If the function does not recognize a parameter, it might ignore it or return an error? But that's beyond our control.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function without specifying parameters? But the function requires the `parameters` argument.\n\n The function signature: \n   boardgame.get_info(name: str, parameters: list, language: str = \"English\")\n\n We must pass a list of parameters.\n\n We'll try: parameters=['rating', 'player_count']\n\n But note: the function might use different names. We hope that the function is designed to accept these.\n\n Also, the language is not specified, so we can use the default (English).\n\n Therefore, we call:\n   boardgame.get_info(name=\"Ticket to Ride\", parameters=[\"rating\", \"player_count\"], language=\"English\")\n\n However, if we are not sure, we might also try to get more parameters? But the user only asked for two.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the problem into two calls? But that would be inefficient and the function allows multiple parameters.\n\n Considering the above, we will make one call.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n In this case, we are providing the required arguments: name and parameters (and language by default).\n\n So we output the function call.\n\n However, if the function does not have the exact parameters we are requesting, it might not return the data. But that is a risk we have to take.\n\n Alternatively, we might note that the problem does not specify the available parameters, so we are doing our best.\n\n Let's call the function with the two parameters we want.\n\n If we later find that we didn't get the player count, we might have to call again with different parameters? But we are only allowed to output in this turn.\n\n But note: the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n So if in the same turn we can make multiple calls? But the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and we are to output the function calls until we have done our best.\n\n However, the system will consider the turn complete when we stop outputting function calls.\n\n But note: we don't have the result of the function call until we make it and get the response. So we cannot conditionally call again in the same turn? \n\n Therefore, we must try to get all the required information in one go if possible.\n\n Since we are not sure about the parameter names, we might try to get more than just two? But the user only asked for two.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to get a set of common parameters that might cover the ones we need.\n\n But without knowing the available parameters, we cannot.\n\n Given the constraints, we'll call with the parameters we think are most likely.\n\n We'll use:\n   parameters = [\"rating\", \"player_count\"]\n\n But note: in some APIs, the player count might be represented by two fields: min_players and max_players. So we might also include those?\n\n However, the user asked for \"player count\", which is ambiguous. It might mean the range (e.g., 2-5 players). So if we get min_players and max_players, we can combine them.\n\n But if we only get one of them, we don't have the full picture.\n\n Therefore, to be safe, we can request three parameters: \"rating\", \"min_players\", \"max_players\". Then we can form the player count from min and max.\n\n But the function might not have min_players and max_players? It might have a single field for player count? We don't know.\n\n Since we are not sure, and we are allowed to make multiple function calls in the same turn? The problem says we can output multiple function calls? \n\n Actually, the format is: [func1(...), func2(...)]\n\n So we can try:\n\n Option 1: call with [\"rating\", \"player_count\"] and if we don't get player_count, then we try with [\"min_players\", \"max_players\"]? But we don't have the result of the first call until the system runs it.\n\n However, we are to output the function calls without knowing the result. So we cannot conditionally call.\n\n Therefore, we have to decide on one set.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function twice in the same turn? But that might be inefficient and we are not sure which parameters are available.\n\n Considering the ambiguity, I propose we call the function with a set of parameters that might cover the two pieces of information:\n\n   parameters = [\"rating\", \"player_count\", \"min_players\", \"max_players\"]\n\n Then, if the function returns any of the player count representations, we can use that.\n\n But note: the function might return all four? And then we can choose to use either the single \"player_count\" or the min and max.\n\n However, the function might not have all these. But that's okay because the function might only return the ones it has.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   boardgame.get_info(name=\"Ticket to Ride\", parameters=[\"rating\", \"player_count\", \"min_players\", \"max_players\"], language=\"English\")\n\n Then, when we get the result, we can use:\n   - rating: from the \"rating\" field (if present)\n   - player count: if \"player_count\" is present, use that; else, if both \"min_players\" and \"max_players\" are present, we can format as f\"{min_players}-{max_players}\"\n\n But we are only to output the function call, not process the result.\n\n So we make one function call that requests four parameters.\n\n This way, we maximize the chance of getting the player count.\n\n Alternatively, we might be over-requesting? But the function is designed to take a list of parameters, so it should be okay.\n\n Therefore, we decide to call:\n\n   boardgame.get_info(name=\"Ticket to Ride\", parameters=[\"rating\", \"player_count\", \"min_players\", \"max_players\"])\n\n We don't specify language because the default is English and the user didn't specify.\n\n But note: the function call format must be exact. We are using the function name and the parameter names as given.\n\n So we write:\n\n [boardgame.get_info(name=\"Ticket to Ride\", parameters=[\"rating\", \"player_count\", \"min_players\", \"max_players\"])]\n\n However, note that the function has an argument `language` which we can omit because it has a default.\n\n But if we want to be explicit, we can set language=\"English\". But the default is English, so we can skip.\n\n Alternatively, we can write without the language.\n\n Let's write the function call accordingly."}

Since the function says if deck is not provided it will use a standard deck, we can omit the deck.\n But note: the function signature expects `deck` as an optional argument. In the function call, we can skip it because the function will use a standard deck by default.\n However, the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. In this case, the function does not require the deck because it has a default. So we can call without deck.\n\n But note: the function description says: \"If not provided, the deck will be a standard 52 card deck\". So we are safe.\n\n We are going to call: find_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts')\n However, the function expects the deck to be passed? Actually, the function has three parameters: rank, suit, and deck (which is optional). \n We are not providing deck, so we leave it out? But the function call format requires named parameters.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.

Since it is optional, we don't have to.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n The required parameters are rank and suit.

Actually, the function name in the docstring is `find_card_in_deck`? \n Let me check: the function name is given as `find_card_in_deck` in the triple quote. But note the typo? It says `find_card_in_deck` in the function header? \n Actually, the function name in the docstring is written correctly: `find_card_in_deck`? No, wait: the function name in the docstring is `find_card_in_deck`? \n The user wrote: \"Function: find_card_in_deck\" ... wait, the docstring says: \n    # Function: find_card_in_deck\n\n So the function name is `find_card_in_deck` (with an 'k' at the end? No, it's 'deck' -> 'deck' ends with 'k' sound but spelled with 'ck'? Actually, it's spelled `deck`).\n\n Actually, the function name is `find_card_in_deck`? The docstring says: \n    Function: find_card_in_deck\n\n So we must use `find_card_in_deck`.\n\n Therefore, the call is: [find_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts')]\n\n But note: the function has an optional `deck` argument. Since we are not providing it, we can skip it? \n The function call format: we are only passing the required and any optional we want?

Here, it's \"Manhattan, New York\". Note: we can use \"New York\" or \"Manhattan\", but the user said \"near Manhattan, New York\". \n     Since the function doesn't have a parameter for \"near\", we can interpret \"near Manhattan\" as being in Manhattan or nearby. \n     However, the function expects a location. We can use \"Manhattan\" as the location because the user wants a hotel near Manhattan, and booking in Manhattan would be near.\n     Alternatively, we can use \"New York\" to cover the broader area. But note: the function doesn't have a parameter for specifying \"near\", so we have to choose the location accordingly.\n     Let's use \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location string.\n\n   - room_type (str): \"single\"\n   - duration (int): 3 nights\n   - start_date (str): \"March 10th, 2023\" -> we can format it as \"2023-03-10\" or keep as string? The function expects a string. \n        We can use the exact string or convert to a standard format. Since the function doesn't specify, we can use the format as given or a common one.\n        Let's convert to a standard format: \"2023-03-10\" (YYYY-MM-DD). However, the example says \"March 10th, 2023\", so we can use that string? \n        But note: the function may require a specific format. Since the docstring doesn't specify, we can use the common format \"YYYY-MM-DD\" for clarity.\n\n        How to convert: \n          March 10th, 2023 -> year=2023, month=03, day=10 -> \"2023-03-10\"\n\n   - preferences (list): Optional.

If the function does not have a way to specify \"near\", we are using \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location. \n This might return hotels in Manhattan, which is acceptable because Manhattan is in New York and the user wants near Manhattan.\n\n However, if the function supports a broader area, we might need to adjust. But the function doesn't have a radius parameter. So we have to rely on the location string.\n\n Since the function doesn't specify how to handle \"near\", we assume that by providing \"Manhattan, New York\" we are covering the core area.\n\n Let's proceed with the call.\n\n Important: The function parameters must be passed by name.

We are converting \"March 10th, 2023\" to \"2023-03-10\". This is a standard format and likely to be accepted.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the original string? The function might be able to parse it. But to be safe, using a standard format is better.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n We have all the required parameters: location, room_type, duration, start_date.
