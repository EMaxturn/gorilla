Then, do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, so the first step is to get HCF(45, 60). Let me note that down. The function provided is math.hcf, which takes two integers. So I need to call that function with 45 and 60. Then, take the result from that and use it as one of the numbers in the next HCF calculation with 90 and 120. Hmm, but how exactly? The user says \"use that result to find the HCF with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe the next step is to take the previous HCF result and combine it with 90 and 120? Wait, no. The HCF of three numbers? Or is it the HCF of the previous result with each of the new pair? Let me think. The HCF of two numbers is the highest number that divides both.
