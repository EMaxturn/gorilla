Unless there are different editions? However, the function doesn't specify edition.\n Since the problem does not specify edition, we can assume we are looking for the standard edition or the base game.\n\n However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for the given game title. We don't have a function to compare multiple editions.\n\n Let's read the function descriptions again:\n   - `video_games.store_price`: Fetches the selling price of a specified game in a particular gaming platform store and in a specific region.\n\n Since the user asks for the cheapest selling price, but we don't have a function that returns multiple prices (like different editions) and then we take the minimum, we have to consider:\n\n Option 1: The user might be referring to the base game, so we can just get the base game price.\n Option 2: But note, the function `video_games.store_price` might return the price for the base game only? We don't know.\n\n However, looking at the available functions, we don't have one that returns multiple editions and their prices. So we can only get one price per call.\n\n Therefore, we might interpret the question as: what is the current selling price of the base game of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on PlayStation Store in the US?\n\n But note: the user says \"cheapest\". This might imply that there could be multiple versions? However, without a function to get multiple editions, we cannot compare.\n\n Since the problem does not specify edition, and we don't have a function to get multiple editions, we will call `video_games.store_price` for the base game.\n\n However, the function `video_games.store_price` does not take an edition parameter. So we can only get one price per call? \n\n Let me check: the function only takes `game_title`, `platform`, and `region`. So it must be that the function returns the price for the standard edition or the base game.\n\n Alternatively, it might be that the store only lists one version? Or the function returns the lowest price among available editions? The description doesn't say.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will assume that the function returns the price for the base game or the standard edition.\n\n Therefore, we can call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region of 'United States', so we can omit the region? However, the user specifically says \"in the United States\", so we can pass it to be explicit.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But we have all the parameters: game_title, platform, and region (with default so we can omit, but we are providing).\n\n So we will call the function.\n\n But wait: what if the game is on sale? The price returned by `video_games.store_price` should be the current selling price (which might be the sale price if on sale). So that function should account for sales.\n\n Alternatively, we could also check if the game is on sale? But the question is about the selling price, and the `store_price` function should return the current price regardless of sale.\n\n Therefore, we can simply use `video_games.store_price`.\n\n However, note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. In the context of the same store and same region, there is only one selling price for the base game? Unless there are different stores (like PlayStation Store vs other retailers) but our functions are for the platform store.\n\n Since we are only looking at the PlayStation Store in the US, we expect one price.\n\n Therefore, we will call the function once.\n\n But note: there might be different editions (like Standard, Gold, Ultimate) which are different products. The user might be asking for the cheapest among these? \n\n The function `video_games.store_price` takes a game_title. We would have to call it for each edition? But the function does not take edition as a parameter, and we don't have a function to list editions.\n\n Given the constraints, we cannot get multiple editions. Therefore, we have to assume the user means the base game.\n\n Alternatively, we might interpret the question as: what is the current price of the game (base) and that is the cheapest? Because if there are multiple editions, the base is the cheapest? \n\n However, without knowing the editions, we cannot be sure.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we don't have a function to get multiple editions, we will get the base game.\n\n So the plan:\n   Call video_games.store_price for the base game.\n\n If the user intended to get the cheapest among editions, we cannot do that with the current functions.\n\n Therefore, we call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` is also available. We might need to know the currency? However, the question asks for the price, and the price function should return an amount and currency? The description doesn't specify the return value, but we assume it returns a number (and the currency for the region is known?).\n\n Alternatively, we can also get the currency for the region to present the price in the correct currency? But the question only asks for the price, and the currency is implied (USD for US). \n\n However, to be safe, we can also call `video_games.store_currency` to get the currency for the US region on PlayStation? But note the function `video_games.store_currency` takes platform and region.\n\n But the question does not ask for the currency, only the price. So we don't need to call it? Unless the price function returns a string that includes the currency? We don't know.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the return format, we assume the price function returns a numeric value? Or a string with the amount? We don't have to worry about that in the function call.\n\n Therefore, we only need to call `video_games.store_price`.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.on_sale` is available. We can check if the game is on sale? But that doesn't change the fact that we are getting the current price from `store_price`. So it's redundant.\n\n So the final call is:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But note: the region parameter in the function has a default of United States. So we could omit region? However, the user specifically says \"in the United States\", so we include it for clarity.\n\n Therefore, we write the tool call accordingly."}
