The second one has loc, type, and time (optional). The user provided all three parameters: location, type as 'Plus', and time 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the first function's loc parameter requires 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided exactly. The second function's loc is 'City, State', but the user's address includes the street.

The functions provided are for sending messages, pausing heartbeats, managing memory, and making HTTP requests.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to know Shishir Patil's birthday from some existing data. But according to the functions, there's no function to retrieve personal information. The core memory and archival memory functions allow storing and retrieving data, but the user hasn't provided any prior information about Shishir Patil's birthday. So, I can't retrieve it from memory unless it's already stored.\n\nThe user might be testing if I can use the archival memory to store birthdays. But since the user hasn't provided any prior data, I can't assume that. The functions available don't include a way to look up external data, so I can't fetch the birthday from an external source. Therefore, I need to inform the user that I can't retrieve the birthday and that I can't send a message without knowing the recipient's details.

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the period October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is provided, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions yet. Wait, the question mentions \"summary of transactions for this period,\" but the parameters for BankStatementOverView require a transaction_overview as a dictionary. \n\nBut looking at the functions, there's also transaction_summary.generate which requires a list of transactions, dates, etc. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the transaction_overview in BankStatementOverView can be constructed using the totals provided. But the function parameters for BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview is a dict, so perhaps we can include the totals there. However, the user also mentioned that they want a summary of transactions, which might require the transaction_summary.generate function. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe we can only use the BankStatementOverView with the given totals in the transaction_overview.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate is needed to generate the summary, but without the individual transactions, we can't call that function. Wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only the total deposits and withdrawals. So perhaps the transaction_overview in BankStatementOverView can be filled with the totals provided. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe BankStatementOverView requires transaction_overview as a dict. The user provided starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with keys like 'total_deposits', 'total_withdrawals', 'starting_balance', 'ending_balance', and maybe the count of transactions. But the user hasn't given the number of transactions. However, the user might expect that the transaction_overview includes these totals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed, but since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, we can't call that. Therefore, the best approach is to use BankStatementOverView with the given parameters, including the totals in the transaction_overview. \n\nSo, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview is a dict, and the function's parameters require it. However, the user also mentioned \"summary of transactions for this period,\" which might require more detailed data. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe the transaction_overview can be constructed with the totals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed, but without the individual transactions, we can't call it. Therefore, the only possible function to use here is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and the transaction_overview containing the totals. \n\nSo the correct function call would be BankStatementOverView with the parameters as above. The user might need to have the transaction_overview filled with the provided totals. Therefore, the answer should be to call BankStatementOverView with those parameters."}

The uuid is required, and download is optional.\n\nThe user didn't mention anything about downloading the file, just returning the VEX. So the download parameter should be false, which is the default. So I need to call export_project_as_cyclone_dx1 with the given uuid. The other functions like upload_vex1 or upload_vex are for uploading CycloneDX documents, which doesn't seem relevant here since the user is asking to export, not upload.\n\nSo the correct function to use is export_project_as_cyclone_dx1 with the uuid provided. The download parameter can be omitted since it's optional and defaults to false. Therefore, the tool call should be to that function with the uuid set to the given value."}
{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. Let me check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right. The parameters needed are category, location, price_range, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" so price_range should be set to that. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. Wait, the user just said New York. Oh, the function's location parameter says the state has to be abbreviated. So maybe the location should be 'New York, NY'. Also, the user wants outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. But wait, the function's parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants: the location is 'City, State' with state abbreviated. So I need to format the location as 'New York, NY'. The category isn't specified, but the user didn't mention a cuisine type, so maybe leave it out? Wait, the function requires the category parameter to be true. Wait, looking back: the function's parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' as required. Oh, the user didn't specify a category, so maybe that's an issue. But the user's request is about price and outdoor seating. Maybe the category can be left as default? Wait, no, the function requires the category to be provided. Hmm, the user didn't mention a category, so perhaps I need to check if that's acceptable. Wait, the function's parameters say category is required. So the user's query must have a category, but they didn't specify. Wait, the user's message says \"find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York\". So the category isn't specified. But the function requires the category parameter. So maybe the user's request is missing that? Or perhaps the category is optional? Wait, looking back at the function definition for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants: the category is required. So the user's query is missing the category. But the user didn't mention a cuisine type. Maybe the function allows for a default or maybe the user intended to leave it out. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the user's request is missing that parameter. However, maybe the user is okay with any category as long as the price and outdoor seating are met. But the function requires the category. So perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave the category as a general category. But the function requires it. So perhaps the user's query is incomplete. However, the user might not have specified the category, so maybe the function can be called with a placeholder? Wait, but the function requires it. Therefore, the user's request is missing the category parameter. But the user didn't mention it. So maybe the assistant should point that out. However, the user's instruction says that if the question lacks parameters, point it out. But the user's question is to find restaurants in New York with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category is required, but the user didn't specify. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the category is required. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should make function calls if possible. However, since the category is required and not provided, the assistant can't proceed. Wait, but maybe the category can be left as a default? No, the function requires it. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the category is missing. But the user's question didn't mention it. So the assistant should respond that the category is required. However, the user might not have provided it. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the category is required. But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category is required, but the user didn't specify.

However, the user's question is in the context of the task, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the available info. Wait, but the function requires the category.

The \"FindMovies\" function has a \"show_type\" parameter. Wait, the user is asking for what's on, so maybe \"GetTimesForMovie\" if they have a specific movie, but they don't. Alternatively, \"FindMovies\" can search by location and show type. Let me check the parameters.\n\nThe \"FindMovies\" function requires location, which is given as Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville. Wait, the location parameter is \"City, State\", but the user provided a theater name. Hmm, maybe the location here is the city, and the theater name is separate. Wait, the user's question is about the Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville. So the location would be Danville, CA? But the function's location parameter is \"City, State\". So maybe the user's location is Danville, CA. But the theater name is Century Blackhawk Plaza. However, the \"FindMovies\" function has a \"theater_name\" parameter which is optional. So perhaps the user is looking for movies at that specific theater. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for show times of Imax films at that theater. But the initial question is \"what's on?\" which is about the current schedule. So maybe \"GetTimesForMovie\" is not the right one because that requires a movie name. But the user hasn't specified a movie. So maybe \"FindMovies\" is the way to go. Let me check the parameters again. The \"FindMovies\" function allows specifying location, theater name, genre, and show type. The user mentioned Imax, which is a show type. So the parameters would be location: Danville, CA (assuming that's the city), theater_name: Century Blackhawk Plaza, show_type: Imax. But wait, the location parameter in FindMovies is \"City, State\", so Danville, CA. The theater name is optional. So the function call would be Movies_1_FindMovies with location=\"Danville, CA\", theater_name=\"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type=\"Imax\". That should retrieve the movies showing at that theater with Imax format. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for show times, but since they didn't specify a movie, maybe the answer is to list the available movies. So using FindMovies makes sense here. So the correct function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with the given parameters."}

So using \"Atlanta, GA\" as the origin_airport and \"Boston, MA\" as destination_airport should be acceptable. But maybe the function expects the IATA code. However, the description says it can take the name or code. So it's safe to use the city names here.\n\nDeparture date is March 12, 2023, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, so \"2023-03-12\".

Therefore, the assistant should make two function calls: one for \"concert\" and one for \"play\". But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple categories.

The required parameter is location, which the user provided as Sacramento, California. The function also allows optional parameters like star_rating, smoking_allowed, and number_of_rooms. The user didn't specify any of these, so I should probably set them to 'dontcare' or false if they're not needed. The location should be formatted as 'Sacramento, CA' since it's in the US. So I'll call Hotels_4_SearchHotel with location='Sacramento, CA' and the other parameters as optional, maybe using default values. Wait, the function parameters for smoking_allowed are boolean, so if the user didn't mention it, maybe set it to false. But the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it out or set to 'dontcare'? Wait, looking back at the function description for smoking_allowed: it says select 'true' for smoking rooms, 'false' for non-smoking. But the user didn't mention smoking, so maybe it's better to leave it out or set to 'dontcare'? Wait, the parameter is of type boolean, but the description says to select 'true' or 'false'. However, the parameter is required as false, so maybe the function expects a boolean. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the function can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function allows 'dontcare' as a value. Wait, looking at the parameters again: for number_of_rooms, the description says 'dontcare' is allowed. But for smoking_allowed, the type is boolean, required is false. So maybe the user can leave it out, or set to false. Since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to omit it. Similarly, star_rating is a string, can be 'dontcare' if not needed. So the function call would be Hotels_4_SearchHotel with location='Sacramento, CA', and the other parameters as optional, possibly not included.

The user didn't specify any particular actor, so the starring parameter can be left as default or set to \"Any\". \n\nWait, the function's parameters: genre is required, starring is optional. Since the user didn't mention any specific actor, I can omit the starring parameter or set it to \"Any\". But the function's description says to use 'Any' if there's no specific preference. So maybe including starring=\"Any\" would be better to ensure it's included. But actually, if the parameter is optional and not provided, the function might default to not filtering by actor. However, the user just wants comic movies, so maybe just specifying the genre as \"comedy\" is sufficient. \n\nSo the correct function call would be Media_3_FindMovies with genre=\"comedy\". That should return a list of comedy movies online. The user didn't mention any other filters, so no need for additional parameters. \n\nI should check if there's any other function that might be relevant, but the other functions are for playing movies, looking up music, or finding attractions. So the right choice is Media_3_FindMovies with genre set to comic. Wait, but the genre parameter is a string, so \"comic\" is the correct value here. The function's description says \"based on specified genre\", so \"comedy\" is the genre. Wait, but the user said \"comic movies\", which might be a genre. However, sometimes \"comic\" can refer to cartoons or something else. But in the context of movies, \"comic\" might be a typo or misunderstanding. But the function uses \"genre\", so maybe the user meant comedy. Alternatively, maybe \"comic\" is a valid genre. But the function's parameters accept any string. So I should use the exact term the user used, which is \"comic\". \n\nWait, but the user might have meant \"comedy\" movies. However, the user wrote \"comic movies\". So perhaps the correct approach is to use \"comic\" as the genre. Alternatively, maybe the user meant \"comedy\". But since the user specified \"comic\", I should go with that. \n\nSo the function call would be Media_3_FindMovies(genre=\"comic\"). That's the best possible with the given info. The user didn't mention any actors, so no need for the starring parameter. Therefore, the correct tool call is Media_3_FindMovies with genre set to \"comic\"."}

The Music_3_LookupMusic function can search based on genre and year. But they also mentioned an album, \"Gotta Be Me\". However, the LookupMusic function parameters include artist, album, genre, and year. So maybe use that to find songs from the album that fit the genre and year.\n\nWait, but the user wants to play the song. So after finding the songs, maybe use PlayMedia to play them.

The user didn't specify a device, so maybe leave that out.\n\nFirst, use Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, and album=Gotta Be Me. That should retrieve the relevant songs. Then, once we have the track names, use Music_3_PlayMedia with those tracks, specifying the album and genre if needed. But the user might not have provided the track names, so maybe the LookupMusic will return the tracks, and then PlayMedia can be called with those tracks. However, the user's message doesn't specify a track, so maybe the LookupMusic is the first step to find the tracks, and then PlayMedia is used to play them. But since the user is asking to \"hear a song\", maybe the system needs to first find the songs and then play them. But the functions are separate. So the first step is to look up the songs using LookupMusic with the given parameters, then play them using PlayMedia. However, the user might not have provided the track names, so the assistant needs to call LookupMusic first to get the track names, then use PlayMedia with those tracks. But the user's message is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from the album \"Gotta Be Me\" that's Hillbilly style from 2019. So the assistant can call PlayMedia with track= (but track name isn't given), so maybe the LookupMusic is needed to find the track names first. But the user might not have the track names, so the assistant should first use LookupMusic to find the tracks that match the criteria, then play them. However, the user's message is a request to \"hear a song\", so maybe the assistant should first look up the songs and then play them. But the functions are separate. So the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once the tracks are found, use Music_3_PlayMedia with those tracks. But since the user hasn't provided track names, the assistant needs to first find them. However, the user might not have the track names, so the assistant should first call LookupMusic to get the list, then play the first one. But the user's message is a single request. So the assistant should first call LookupMusic to find the songs, then PlayMedia to play them. But the user might not have provided the track names, so the assistant needs to use LookupMusic first. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once the tracks are retrieved, use PlayMedia with the track names from the result. But since the user hasn't provided track names, the assistant can't directly call PlayMedia without them. Therefore, the first step is to look up the tracks.

{"id": "live_multiple_847-179-1", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Since the user is asking to book a reservation, the ReserveRestaurant function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for ReserveRestaurant: restaurant_name, location, time, number_of_seats, and date. The user provided the restaurant name as Balthazar, location as New York. The time is 8 in the evening, which in 24-hour format is 20:00. The date is this Friday. I need to figure out the exact date. If today is, say, October 25th, this Friday would be October 30th. But since the current date isn't given, maybe the function expects the user to provide the date in ISO format. Wait, the user said \"this Friday,\" so I need to calculate the correct date. However, the function requires the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. But the user hasn't specified the exact date, just \"this Friday.\" Hmm, maybe the system can handle that, but the function requires the date parameter. So perhaps the user expects the assistant to know the current date and compute the Friday. But since the assistant doesn't have real-time data, maybe the user expects the date to be filled in as 'this Friday' as a parameter. Wait, no, the function requires the date in ISO format. So maybe the user's request is missing the exact date. But the user said \"this Friday,\" so the assistant should figure out the correct date. However, without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute it. Wait, but maybe the user is expecting the assistant to use the current date.

Since the user is asking to find an itinerary, not purchase a ticket yet, the Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Buses_3_FindBus: from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles, and departure_date as March 10th, 2023. The date format needs to be MM/DD/YYYY, so March 10th would be 03/10/2023. The user is traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1. The category is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it out or set to default. \n\nWait, the parameters for FindBus don't require category, so it's optional. The user didn't mention anything about the route category, so I can omit that parameter. So the function call should include from_city, to_city, departure_date, and num_passengers. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\nfrom_city: \"Fresno, CA\"\nto_city: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\ndeparture_date: \"03/10/2023\"\nnum_passengers: 1\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required ones are from_city, to_city, departure_date. Num_passengers is optional but the user specified they're traveling alone, so including it as 1 is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Buses_3_FindBus with those parameters."}

The parameters required are location, free_entry, category, and good_for_kids.\n\nThe user specified \"free attractions,\" so free_entry should be \"True.\" They also mentioned \"kid friendly,\" so good_for_kids should be \"True.\" The location is San Francisco, so I'll set location to \"San Francisco, CA.\" The category isn't specified, so I can leave that as \"dontcare\" or maybe specify a category like \"recreational parks\" but since the user didn't mention a specific type, it's safer to use \"dontcare\" to include all categories. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for category have options like religious sites, parks, historical landmarks, etc. But the user didn't specify a category, so using \"dontcare\" is correct. So the function call should include location, free_entry=True, good_for_kids=True, and category=\"dontcare\". \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.

The user wants to book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA on May 15, 2023, starting one day before, with trip protection.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The functions available are for booking hotels and trains. Since the user is asking about train tickets, the relevant functions are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. \n\nThe user wants to book tickets, so the Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function is the right choice because it's for reserving tickets. The other function, Trains_1_FindTrains, is for finding available trains, which isn't what the user needs here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. \n\nThe user specified Portland, OR as the starting city, Seattle, WA as the destination. The date is May 15, 2023, but the journey starts one day before. Wait, the date_of_journey parameter is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user said \"one day before\" the journey date. So if the journey is on May 15, 2023, starting one day before would be May 14, 2023. But the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, which is May 15. Wait, maybe the journey starts on May 15, but the user wants to depart one day before? Or is the date_of_journey the departure date? The function's date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so if the user wants to start the journey on May 15, then the date is 2023-05-15. However, the user says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they mean the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15? That's a bit confusing. Wait, the user says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". So perhaps the journey is on May 15, but the departure time is one day before? Or maybe the journey date is May 15, and the start time is one day before? Wait, the journey_start_time is the start time of the train journey. So if the journey is on May 15, but the user wants to start at one day before, that would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. Hmm, maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, meaning the train departs on May 15 at a time one day before? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the user meant that the journey is on May 15, but the train departs one day before, which would be May 14. But that would be a different date. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the function's date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so if the user wants the journey on May 15, then the date_of_journey is 2023-05-15. The journey_start_time is the time on that day. So maybe the user wants the train to depart on May 15, but the start time is one day before? That's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 14, but they said May 15. This is a bit unclear.

The user mentioned \"good reputation,\" which probably translates to a high rating. The function has an avg_rating parameter, so I'll set that to 4.5 or 5.0. \n\nNext, the location: Bangkok is the province, so province_id should be 1.

So the correct function to use is get_websites with status_filter set to \"active\". The parameters required for get_websites are status_filter (optional) and include_metadata (optional). Since the user didn't mention metadata, maybe we can omit include_metadata or set it to false. But the function's required parameters are status_filter as optional. So the call should be get_websites with status_filter=\"active\". That should retrieve all active websites."}

The user wants to add a new service configuration for a service named 'fdsa'. The parameters provided are timeout of 30 seconds, retry count of 5, endpoint URL 'https://api.fdsa-service.com', and it requires authentication.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function can handle adding a new service configuration. Looking at the functions provided, the 'add_service_config' function seems appropriate. It requires 'service_name' and 'configurations' as parameters. The 'configurations' should be a dictionary of key-value pairs.\n\nThe service name is given as 'fdsa'. The configurations need to include timeout, retry count, endpoint, and authentication. The authentication requirement might need a specific key, maybe 'authentication_required' set to True. The timeout is 30 seconds, so 'timeout' key with value 30. Retry count is 5, so 'retry_count' with 5. The endpoint URL is provided as a string.\n\nSo, the configurations dictionary would be something like:\n{\n  \"timeout\": 30,\n  \"retry_count\": 5,\n  \"endpoint_url\": \"https://api.fdsa-service.com\",\n  \"authentication_required\": True\n}\n\nI need to make sure all these keys are correctly named as per the function's expectations. The function's parameters don't specify exact keys, but the description says it's a dictionary of key-value pairs representing the configuration settings. So using standard keys like 'timeout', 'retry_count', 'endpoint_url', and 'authentication_required' makes sense here.\n\nTherefore, the function call should be add_service_config with service_name='fdsa' and configurations as the dictionary above. I don't see any missing parameters here. The user provided all necessary info. So the correct tool call is to use add_service_config with those parameters."}

Then there's get_shareable_api_tokens, which is for custom dashboards. The user didn't mention anything about dashboards, so maybe the first one is the right choice.\n\nThe user's ID is given as \"user123\", which is a string. The get_api_tokens function expects a string for user_id, so that's good. The include_expired parameter is optional, but since the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, maybe they want both active and expired ones. But the user didn't specify, so maybe default to not including expired unless told otherwise. Wait, the default for include_expired is false, so if we don't set it, it won't include expired. But the user might have forgotten both active and expired. However, the function's description says \"include_expired\" is a flag to include them. Since the user is trying to remember all tokens, maybe setting include_expired=True would be better. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the function should be called without that parameter, relying on the default. Wait, the function's parameters have include_expired as required=false, so it's optional. The user might not know if they have expired tokens, so including them would give a complete list. But the user might not want that. Hmm, but the question is to remind them of all API tokens, so perhaps including expired ones would be better. However, the user might not have provided that parameter. Wait, the function's parameters are user_id (required) and include_expired (optional). Since the user didn't mention anything about expired tokens, maybe the function should be called with the default value of include_expired=False. But the user might need all tokens, including expired. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the function should be called without that parameter. Alternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, so setting include_expired=True. But the user didn't say that. Hmm. The function's description for include_expired says \"Flag to determine if expired tokens should be included in the response.\" So if the user is trying to remember all tokens, including expired ones, then include_expired should be True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the assistant should assume that. However, the user might not know if they have expired tokens. But the question is to remind them of all API tokens, so perhaps the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True to get all tokens, even expired ones. But the user might not have provided that parameter. Wait, the function's parameters are user_id (required) and include_expired (optional). So the assistant can choose to include it or not. Since the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, including expired ones, the assistant should set include_expired=True. Therefore, the function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True. Alternatively, maybe the default is False, so not including it would return only active tokens. But the user might have forgotten both active and expired. So to be thorough, include_expired=True. Therefore, the correct function call is get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True. But wait, the user's user ID is \"user123\", which is a string. The function's parameters for get_api_tokens require user_id as a string, which is correct. So the function call would be:\n\nget_api_tokens(user_id=\"user123\", include_expired=True)\n\nBut the user didn't mention anything about expired tokens, so maybe the assistant should just call the function without include_expired, relying on the default. However, the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, so including expired ones would be better. Therefore, the correct function call is to use get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. Alternatively, maybe the user is not aware of expired tokens, but the function can return all. So the assistant should call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True.

The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application\", the create_global_application_alert_config is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (required), alert_type (required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (optional). The user provided the name, threshold as 5% (which is 0.05 as a float), and recipients as two emails. But wait, the alert_type isn't specified. The user mentioned \"error rate threshold\", so maybe the alert_type should be something like 'error_rate'. But the function requires alert_type, so I need to infer that. Alternatively, maybe the function expects a specific type, but since the user didn't specify, I have to assume 'error_rate' as the alert type. \n\nSo the parameters would be name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05, recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. The enabled parameter isn't mentioned, so maybe it's defaulting to true or false? The function says it's optional, so perhaps we can omit it, but the user didn't say to disable it, so maybe it's enabled by default. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for create_global_application_alert_config require all the parameters except enabled. The user didn't mention enabled, so maybe we can leave it out. But the function's required parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. So all those are provided. So the function call should include those four parameters. The alert_type is a bit ambiguous, but since the user mentioned error rate, I'll use 'error_rate' as the alert_type. \n\nSo the correct function call is create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The other functions are for mobile apps or enabling, which don't fit here. So the answer should be the tool call with those parameters."}

Hmm, the description says \"shareable\" tokens, which might be different from all tokens.

Maybe the username is part of the authentication, but the function doesn't take a user_id parameter. \n\nWait, the user provided their user ID as 12345. But the functions might be designed such that the user is authenticated, so the user_id is known. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter. So maybe the user is already authenticated, and the function retrieves their tokens. But the user is asking for all their tokens, so maybe the correct function is get_api_tokens. However, the user's user ID is 12345, but the function doesn't take that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens is the right one, as it requires the user_id.

So maybe the correct function is get_api_tokens, but how to get the user's tokens without a user_id? \n\nThis is confusing. The user provided their user ID, but the functions might not require it for get_api_tokens. Maybe the user is authenticated, so the user_id is known. But the functions don't have a user_id parameter for get_api_tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi function, which requires the user_id. The user's user ID is 12345, so that function can be called with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens, including revoked. But the description of get_shareable_api_tokens says it's for shareable tokens. The user wants all tokens, so maybe that's not the right function. \n\nWait, the user is asking for \"all API tokens\", which might include both shareable and non-shareable. But the functions available are two: one for shareable tokens (CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens) and another for all tokens (api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens). The user's user ID is 12345, which is required for the first function. The second function doesn't take a user_id, so maybe it's for the current user. \n\nBut the user provided their user ID, so maybe the correct approach is to use the get_shareable_api_tokens function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens, including revoked ones. However, the description of get_shareable_api_tokens says it's for shareable tokens, which might not be all. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused, and the correct function is get_api_tokens. But without a user_id, how to know which user's tokens to get? Maybe the user is authenticated, so the function can retrieve their tokens. But the parameters for get_api_tokens don't include user_id. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The user provided their user ID, but the functions might not require it for get_api_tokens.

So the correct function is get_api_tokens with include_expired=True to get all tokens, including expired. \n\nBut the user didn't mention expired, but they want all. So maybe call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. However, the parameters for get_api_tokens are include_expired, page, page_size.

The user's main request is to get all API tokens, and they provided their user ID. The functions available are two: one for shareable tokens (needs user_id) and another for all tokens (doesn't need user_id). \n\nAssuming that the user is authenticated, the correct function is get_api_tokens. But the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary for the other function. However, the user might not have provided the necessary parameters for the other function. \n\nWait, the user's user ID is 12345, but the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id. So maybe the user is authenticated, and the function can retrieve their tokens. Therefore, the correct function is get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. \n\nBut the user might not know about expired tokens, but they want all. So the function call would be get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function, which requires user_id=12345. But the description says it's for shareable tokens. The user might be confused, but the function is available. \n\nBut the user says \"all API tokens\", so maybe the correct function is get_api_tokens. \n\nIn conclusion, the user provided their user ID, but the get_api_tokens function doesn't require it. So the correct function is get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. However, the user might need to be authenticated, which is assumed. \n\nSo the function call would be api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens(include_expired=True). But the user might need to provide page and page_size, but they didn't. So maybe default values. \n\nAlternatively, the user might need to use the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True.
