They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the period October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account holder's name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires the bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided the bank name, account number, account type (checking), full name, and the starting and ending balances, as well as total deposits and withdrawals. However, the transaction overview is a parameter that's required, but the user hasn't provided specific transaction details. Wait, the user mentioned the beginning and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals, but not the individual transactions. So maybe the transaction overview is a summary that includes these totals. \n\nThe user also wants a summary of transactions, which might be covered by the transaction_summary.generate function. That function requires transactions, starting and ending dates, total deposits, withdrawals, starting balance, ending balance, and other parameters like first and last names. But the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details. However, they did provide the total amounts. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\n1. Use BankStatementOverView to get the overview with the given parameters. The user provided the bank name, account number, account type, full name, and the transaction overview which includes the totals. But the transaction_overview parameter is a dict, so maybe the user expects that to be filled with the totals. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, just the totals. So perhaps the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is a summary that includes the totals. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView function's parameters include transaction_overview as a dict, which is required. The user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, but they have the totals. So maybe the transaction_overview is a dictionary with keys like total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, etc. But the function's description says it's a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts. So perhaps the user can provide the totals as part of the transaction_overview. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is filled with the totals. However, the function's parameters require the transaction_overview as a dict, which the user hasn't provided. So maybe the function can be called with the provided parameters, and the transaction_overview is a placeholder. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the transaction_overview is generated based on the provided totals. But the function's parameters require the transaction_overview to be a dict, which the user hasn't provided. So perhaps the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is a summary that includes the totals. \n\nBut the user's question also asks for a summary of transactions, which would be handled by the transaction_summary.generate function. That function requires the transactions list, which the user hasn't provided. However, they have the total deposits and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the total deposits, withdrawals, and the other parameters. \n\nWait, the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, but not the individual transactions. So the transaction_summary.generate would need the transactions list, which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, maybe the function can't be called without the transactions list. \n\nBut the user might expect that the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters. However, the function's parameters require the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the function can't be called. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_overview is a parameter that can be filled with the totals, and the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the functions again. \n\nThe BankStatementOverView function requires the transaction_overview as a dict, which is a summary of transactions. The user provided the totals, so maybe the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with keys like total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, etc. \n\nSo, the first step is to call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. The parameters are:\n\n- bank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n- account_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n- account_type: \"checking\"\n- full_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n- transaction_overview: a dict with the totals. But the user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, so maybe the transaction_overview is a placeholder. However, the function requires it. \n\nWait, the user provided the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and total withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with those values. For example:\n\n{\n  \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n  \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40,\n  \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n  \"ending_balance\": 6737.37\n}\n\nBut the function's parameters require the transaction_overview as a dict, so this would be acceptable. \n\nThen, the user also wants a summary of transactions, which would be handled by the transaction_summary.generate function. However, that function requires the transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. But they have the total deposits and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is not provided. But the function's parameters require the transactions array. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is not provided. But according to the function's parameters, the transactions array is required. \n\nSo, the user's request has two parts: the overview and the summary. \n\nFor the overview, call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters and the transaction_overview as a dict with the totals. \n\nFor the summary, call transaction_summary.generate with the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, and other parameters like first and last names. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the transactions array is missing. Therefore, the transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the transactions array. \n\nBut the user might have intended that the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is not provided. However, according to the function's parameters, the transactions array is required. \n\nTherefore, the answer would need to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and transaction_overview, and then note that the transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the transactions array. \n\nBut the user might expect that the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters. However, the function requires the transactions array. \n\nSo, the answer would be to call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters and the transaction_overview, and then mention that the transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the transactions array. \n\nBut the user's question asks for both an overview and a summary. So, the assistant needs to call both functions where possible. \n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\n1. BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and transaction_overview.\n2. transaction_summary.generate with the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, and the first and last names.\n\nBut the transactions array is required for the second function. Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the assistant can't call it. However, the user might have intended that the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is missing. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might need to point out that the transactions array is required. \n\nIn the end, the assistant should make the function calls where possible, and if not possible, point out the missing parameters."}

The get_show_times function requires city, movie_name, movie_date, cinema_hall, movie_language, and movie_format. \n\nThe user's question is about movies playing today in Noida. They didn't mention specific movies, cinema halls, or languages, so those parameters might not be needed. The get_movies function can be used if we don't need to specify cinema_hall or format, but the user didn't provide those. However, the get_show_times function requires movie_name, which the user hasn't given. \n\nWait, the user is asking for movies playing today, not specific showtimes. So maybe get_movies is more appropriate. But the get_movies function's parameters include city, which is provided (Noida), and movie_date. The user said \"today,\" so the movie_date would be 'today'. But the function's movie_date parameter is required only if provided. However, the user hasn't specified the movie_language or format, so those can be omitted. \n\nBut the get_movies function's parameters have movie_date as optional. So, if the user wants to know which movies are playing today in Noida, we can call get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date='today'. The other parameters like cinema_hall and format are optional and can be left out. \n\nAlternatively, get_show_times requires movie_name, which the user hasn't provided. So that function might not be suitable here.

But the user said \"today,\" which might be the same as the default. However, the function's movie_date parameter accepts 'today' as a value. So maybe the user's \"today\" is the same as the default date. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date='today'. But the function's movie_date parameter is of type string and required only if provided.

The available functions are get_movies, get_show_times, and get_movie_details.\n\nThe user wants to know the movies playing in Noida today. The get_movies function seems relevant because it retrieves movies in a specified city and cinema hall, with options to filter by date. The get_show_times function is for specific show times, but the user is asking for a list of movies, not times. The get_movie_details function is for detailed info of a specific movie, which isn't what they need here.\n\nSo, the get_movies function is the right choice. The parameters required are city, and optionally cinema_hall, movie_date, etc. The user mentioned Noida as the city and today's date. The function requires the city parameter, which is provided. The movie_date is optional, but since the user said \"today,\" I should set movie_date to today's date in India.

The get_detail_adriel_project function seems more appropriate because it's designed to retrieve full details of a specific project, including status and role.\n\nThe parameters for get_detail_adriel_project require the project name, which the user provided as 'e-commerce-web'. The other parameters like include_financials and date_format are optional. Since the user didn't mention financials or date format, I can omit those.

Its description says it exports VEX info in CycloneDX format. The parameters required are uuid and download. The download parameter is optional. Since the user just wants the VEX, maybe they don't need to download it as a file, so set download to false.\n\nWait, but the function's required parameters are uuid, and download is optional.

However, the function's description says it's for exploring movies based on genre and actors. The genre parameter is required, but the user hasn't specified a genre. They might be referring to a specific comic genre like action, adventure, etc. \n\nSince the user didn't specify a genre, but the function requires it, I need to ask for clarification. However, the user might expect me to use a default genre. But according to the function's parameters, if the genre isn't provided, maybe it's optional? Wait, the required parameter is genre, and starring is optional. So if the user hasn't specified a genre, maybe I can call the function with a default genre like 'comics' or 'action' to see if that works.

However, the function's parameters don't have a specific genre option for comics. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to movies that are based on comic books, but the function's parameters don't have a 'comics' genre. So perhaps the best approach is to call Media_3_FindMovies with a genre parameter set to 'comics' and see if that returns the desired results.

However, the user might be expecting that the function can be used with a custom genre. \n\nSo, the answer would be to call Media_3_FindMovies with genre='comics' and starring='Any' to explore comic movies. If that doesn't work, the user might need to provide more details. But based on the given functions, this is the best possible call."}

The user mentioned a debit card, so the payment_method would be \"debit card\". The amount is $90, and the receiver is Alice. The function requires the payment_method, amount, receiver, and optionally private_visibility. Since the user didn't specify privacy, I can leave that as false. So the parameters would be payment_method=\"debit card\", amount=90, receiver=\"Alice\". I think that's all. The other function, RequestPayment, might be for sending a request, but the user wants to initiate the transaction, so MakePayment is the right choice."}

The Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, and trip_protection. The user mentioned 4 business class tickets, so number_of_adults should be 4. The journey starts one day before May 15, so the date_of_journey would be May 14, 2023. The journey_start_time is one day before, which is 23:59 on May 14. The trip_protection is included, so trip_protection should be true. The _class is business class, which is specified in the function's parameters. \n\nWait, the _class parameter is a string, so I need to set it to \"business\" or the exact value expected by the system. The function's description says \"_class\" is the fare class, so maybe it's a string like \"business\" or \"business class\". The user specified \"business class\", but the function might expect a shorter form. However, the user's instruction says to use the exact parameters as given. Since the function's _class parameter is a string, I'll use \"business\" as the value.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n_from = \"Portland, OR\"\nto = \"Seattle, WA\"\ndate_of_journey = \"2023-05-14\"\njourney_start_time = \"23:59\"\nnumber_of_adults = 4\ntrip_protection = True\n_class = \"business\"\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required parameters are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, and trip_protection. The _class is optional, but the user specified business class, so include it. \n\nSo the function call should be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with these parameters. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I don't need to handle anything else. The other functions like Hotels_2_BookHouse or Hotels_2_SearchHouse aren't relevant here since it's about trains."}

The get_service_providers function seems relevant here. It has parameters for province_id, district_name, start_available_date, and avg_rating. The user mentioned Bangkok, so the province_id would be 1. The district is Chatuchak, so district_name is \"Chatuchak\". The available date is March 22nd, 2024, which needs to be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. So start_available_date would be '2024-03-22 00:00:00'. The avg_rating is for a good reputation, so maybe set avg_rating to 4 or 5. The user didn't specify a minimum or maximum age, so those parameters can be left as null. Other parameters like has_quality_problem, is_excellent, etc., might not be needed here. \n\nWait, the user wants a good reputation, so maybe setting is_excellent to true? Or maybe avg_rating to 4.5? But the function's avg_rating is a float, so maybe 4.5. But the user didn't specify a particular rating, just a good one. So perhaps setting avg_rating to 4.5 or 5.0. But the function's parameters have avg_rating as optional, so maybe set it to 4.5. \n\nSo the function call would be get_service_providers with province_id=1, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", start_available_date='2024-03-22 00:00:00', avg_rating=4.5.

Then, the service type is ironing, but the function parameters don't have a direct service ID. However, there's a service_ids parameter which is an array. But the user didn't specify a particular service ID, so maybe I can set service_ids to include ironing. Wait, the function's service_ids parameter is an array of service identifiers. But the user just mentioned ironing, so maybe I need to assume that the service ID for ironing is 2, but the problem is that the function's parameters don't have a way to specify the service ID. Alternatively, maybe the service_ids parameter can be set to [\"ironing\"], but the function's description says it's an array of service identifiers. However, the user hasn't provided specific service IDs, so perhaps the function can be called with province_id=1 (Bangkok) and service_ids=[\"ironing\"] to filter by that service.

The user just said \"ironing services,\" so maybe the service_ids parameter can be set to [\"ironing\"] if that's how the function expects it.

The include_metadata might be useful to get the creation and update dates, but the user didn't specify that. However, since they asked for all actively configured, maybe including metadata is optional but helpful.\n\nThe other functions are about website configuration api and application settings, but the get_websites function seems directly relevant here. The website_configuration_api.get_website requires a websiteId, which the user hasn't provided, so that's not applicable here. The ApplicationSettingsApi.get_service_configs is for service configurations, not websites.\n\nSo the correct function is get_websites with status_filter set to 'active'. The include_metadata can be left as default or set to true if needed. Since the user didn't specify metadata, but they want the list, maybe including metadata is better to have more details. But the function's required parameters don't require include_metadata, so it's optional. The user just wants the list, so maybe just status_filter is enough. Wait, the status_filter is a string, and the example says active, inactive, under maintenance.

The first one, get_api_tokens, retrieves tokens associated with the user's account, and the second, get_shareable_api_tokens, does the same but for custom dashboards. The user mentioned their user ID is \"user123\", so both functions require the user_id parameter.\n\nThe problem is that the user hasn't provided any other parameters. The functions have optional parameters like include_expired, but the user didn't specify whether they want expired tokens or not. Since the question is about reminding them of the tokens, it's likely they want all tokens, including expired ones. However, the functions don't have a default for include_expired, so maybe we need to assume it's false unless specified. But the user didn't mention it, so maybe we should call both functions? Wait, no. The user is asking for a list of tokens, and the functions are designed to retrieve them. But the user ID is given as \"user123\".\n\nWait, the functions have different parameters. The get_api_tokens function's user_id is a string, and the get_shareable_api_tokens also takes a user_id as a string. The user's user ID is \"user123\", so both functions can be called with that ID. However, the user might be asking for the shareable tokens, but the question says \"remind me of them\" which is vague. But the functions are the only options.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified whether they want shareable or all tokens. The question is a bit ambiguous. However, the functions are available, so the correct approach is to call the get_api_tokens function with the user_id \"user123\" and maybe include_expired as true to include expired tokens. But the user didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is for custom dashboards, which might not be relevant here. The user's context isn't clear, but the functions are the only options.\n\nSo, the best approach is to call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True, assuming that the user wants all tokens, including expired ones. Alternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, so the function can be called with include_expired=False, but without that parameter, it's default. However, the user didn't specify, so perhaps we should call the function with the required parameters. Wait, the get_api_tokens function requires user_id, which is provided, and include_expired is optional. So the function can be called with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True. But the user didn't mention including expired, but since they forgot all tokens, maybe they want all, including expired. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to retrieve all tokens, so the function is called with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=False. But without knowing, it's hard. However, the functions are the only options, so the assistant should call the get_api_tokens function with the user_id provided and maybe include_expired as true. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to get shareable tokens, but the question is about reminding them of all tokens. Since the functions are available, the assistant should call the get_api_tokens function with the user_id \"user123\" and include_expired as true. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps the assistant should call the function with the required parameters. The user_id is required, and include_expired is optional. So the function call would be get_api_tokens(user_id=\"user123\", include_expired=True). Alternatively, if the user wants all tokens, including expired, then include_expired=True. If not, maybe False. But since the user didn't specify, the assistant can't know. However, the user is asking for a reminder, which might include all tokens. So the assistant should call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True. But the function's default for include_expired is not specified, but the parameter is optional. So the assistant can call the function with the user_id and include_expired as True.

So the function call would be api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with page=1, page_size=100. But the user might want to include all, so maybe the page_size is 100. So the final function call is to get_api_tokens with page=1 and page_size=100."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to check which functions are available to retrieve this information.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's \"detail_experience_and_education\" which seems relevant. Its description says it retrieves detailed info about professional experiences and education. The parameters include \"experience_or_education_type\" which can be set to \"education\" and \"experience_or_education_name\" to specify the institution.\n\nSo, the user wants education from UNS. The function requires \"experience_or_education_type\" to be \"education\" and \"experience_or_education_name\" to be \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". I need to make sure those parameters are provided. The function doesn't require any other parameters, so that's covered.\n\nAnother function is \"experiences_and_education\" which also deals with experiences and education, but the parameters there include a person_id, which isn't provided here. Since the user hasn't given a person ID, maybe the first function is better. The \"detail_experience_and_education\" function doesn't require a person ID, so that's okay.\n\nSo the correct call would be to use \"detail_experience_and_education\" with \"experience_or_education_type\" as \"education\" and \"experience_or_education_name\" as \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". That should retrieve the needed details."}
{"id": "live_multiple_1051-278-0", "result": "[set_alarm(alarm_time=\"2023-12-1 07:00 AM\", purpose=\"meeting\")]", "input_token_count": 758, "output_token_count": 1042, "latency": 8.028289794921875, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to set a reminder for their meeting tomorrow at 7:00 AM. The date given is 2023-12-1, which is tomorrow. Wait, but the date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD, so tomorrow would be 2023-12-2, right? But the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which might be a typo. But maybe they meant tomorrow, so the date is December 1st, 2023, and the meeting is tomorrow, which would be December 2nd. But the user says \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\", which is a bit confusing. However, the function set_alarm requires the alarm_time parameter. The user specified 7:00 AM, so maybe they want the alarm to go off at 7:00 AM on December 1st, 2023. But the date is in the future. Wait, the user might have a typo, but I need to proceed with the given info.\n\nThe function set_alarm has a parameter alarm_time which can be in various formats. The user says \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\", but the date is 2023-12-1, which is a specific date. So maybe the user wants the alarm to be set for 7:00 AM on that date. But the date is in the past? Wait, if the current date is 2023-12-1, then tomorrow would be 2023-12-2. But the user might have a typo. However, the function's alarm_time can take a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. So perhaps the user intended to set the alarm for 7:00 AM on 2023-12-1, which is the date they provided. But if the current date is after that, then the alarm would be set for the future. But the user might not care about the current date. The function doesn't check if the date is in the future or past, just sets the alarm.\n\nSo the user wants to set a reminder for 7:00 AM tomorrow, which is 2023-12-1. Wait, but if the current date is 2023-12-1, then tomorrow is 2023-12-2. But the user might have a typo. However, the function's alarm_time can take the date as given. So I'll proceed with the given date. The user says \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\", which might be a mistake, but I'll use the date as provided. The alarm time is 7:00 AM. So the alarm_time would be '2023-12-1 07:00:00' if the time is in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. But the user didn't specify the time in the format, but they said 7:00 AM. So the alarm_time would be '2023-12-1 07:00:00' or maybe '7:00 AM' if the date is included. Wait, the function's alarm_time can be in 'HH:MM' or 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM AM/PM' format. So if the date is 2023-12-1, and the time is 7:00 AM, then the alarm_time would be '2023-12-1 07:00 AM' or '2023-12-1 07:00' depending on the format. But the function's parameters allow for the alarm_time to be in various formats. The user's instruction says \"7:00 AM\", so the alarm_time would be '2023-12-1 07:00 AM' if the date is included. However, the user might have intended the date as tomorrow, but the date is given as 2023-12-1. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time='2023-12-1 07:00 AM' and purpose='meeting'. But the user didn't mention a purpose, but the function has a purpose parameter. The user says \"wake up early for a meeting tomorrow\", so the purpose is 'meeting'. Therefore, the function call would be set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-1 07:00 AM', purpose='meeting')."}
