Let me check the available functions. There's the find_card_in_deck function. The parameters needed are rank, suit, and optionally deck. The required ones are rank and suit.

No need to include the deck parameter unless they provided a specific deck. Alright, that's all."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York, for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The preferences are optional but can include pet_friendly.\n\nThe location should be \"Manhattan, New York\" to meet the user's request. Room type is \"single\" as specified. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. Since they mentioned pet-friendly, I should include that in the preferences array. The preferences parameter expects an array of strings from the given enum, so I'll add \"pet_friendly\" there.\n\nWait, the function's parameters have preferences as an array with items from the enum. The user didn't mention other preferences, so just pet_friendly is needed. I need to make sure all required parameters are included. Let me double-check: location, room_type, duration, start_date are all there. Preferences are optional, but since the user specified pet-friendly, including it makes sense. So the function call should have all required parameters plus the preference. I think that's all. No missing parameters here."}
