We can write the numbers as floats or integers? The type is float, so integers are acceptable because they are a subset of floats? Actually, in the parameters, we are told the items are of type float. We can pass integers because they will be converted to float. However, to be safe and explicit, we can write them as floats.\n\n Alternatively, the function might accept integers because in Python integers are a subtype of float? But the specification says float. So we will pass them as floats.\n\n However, note the function description: \"a list of floating-point numbers\". So we can pass [133.0, 34.0] or [133, 34]? Since integers are numbers and can be represented exactly as floats, it should be acceptable. But the type in the parameter specification for the array items is float, so we should use floats. But in the toolcall, we can write the numbers without decimal if we use integer type? But the toolcall expects the type to be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, tuple.\n\n How do we represent the numbers? We are allowed to use integer or float. But the function expects an array of floats. So we can write the numbers as integers and the system will convert? Or we should write them as floats?\n\n The parameter type for the array items is float. In the toolcall, we must represent the numbers in a way that the system can interpret as floats. We can write them as integers because they will be converted to floats. But to be safe, we can write them as floats (with a decimal point).\n\n However, the toolcall format requires that we specify the type of each parameter? Actually, the <param> tag has a type attribute. For the array, we are passing an array of floats. But note: the array itself has a type of array, and the items are of type float. We are going to specify:\n\n   <param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n\n But wait: the type of the parameter \"numbers_list\" is array? Actually, in the function definition, the type of \"numbers_list\" is array (with items of type float). So in the toolcall, we set type=\"array\". However, the value must be a string representation of the array? But note: the toolcall is in XML. We cannot put arbitrary structures? Actually, the value is represented as a string. We have to write the array in a way that the system can parse.\n\n The instruction says: the type fields of the parameters must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. So we set type=\"array\" for the entire list.\n\n How do we represent the array? We can represent it as a JSON array string? Or the system will parse it as a Python literal? Since the system is designed for function calls, it might expect a JSON-like representation.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   <param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n\n But note: the contents of the XML tag must be valid character data. We can escape if necessary, but in this case, it's simple.\n\n However, the specification for the function says the array items are of type float. So we must ensure that the array we pass is of floats. We can write the numbers as integers? But the function expects floats. We can write:\n\n   [133, 34]   -> but that's an array of integers? Or in the context of the tool, it might be converted.\n\n But the function parameter specification says the array items are of type float. So we should write them as floats? Actually, the tool might be able to convert. However, to be safe, we can write them as floats.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that 133 and 34 are integers and we can represent them as floats by adding .0.\n\n But the toolcall does not require the numbers to be written with .0? We can write integers and set the type of the array items? Actually, we are setting the type of the whole parameter to \"array\", but the function expects an array of floats. We are not specifying the item types in the toolcall. So we rely on the system to convert? Or we must write the numbers as floats? Actually, the system will know from the function definition.\n\n Since the function definition is fixed, we can write the array with integer numbers and the system will convert to float? Or we can write them as floats. It is acceptable to write integers in a float array because integers are a subset of floats.\n\n However, to be explicit and avoid any potential issue, we can write the numbers as floats by including a decimal point.\n\n So we'll do:\n\n   numbers_list = [133.0, 34.0]\n\n But note: we cannot write 133.0 in the XML value because that is not a valid number in the array? Actually, we are writing a string that represents an array. We can write:\n\n   [133.0, 34.0]   -> but note that in JSON, numbers can be integers or floats without quotes.\n\n However, the entire value is a string. We must represent it in a way that the system can parse. We can use a JSON string? Or a Python literal? The system is designed to parse the string as a JSON array? Or as a Python array? Since the function is in Python 3, it might be a Python literal.\n\n But the instruction does not specify. We are told to use the type \"array\", so we write the array as a string in JSON format? That is the most standard.\n\n Actually, the example functions are in Python 3, so we can write a Python list literal? But the tool might use a JSON parser. To be safe, we can write it in JSON which is a subset of Python.\n\n So we write:\n\n   [133.0, 34.0]   -> in JSON, that is valid.\n\n But note: in JSON, we can also write integers. So [133, 34] is valid and the function will convert to float? The function expects floats, but the array we pass has integers. The function should handle because integers are floats? Actually, in Python, integers are not floats, but they can be added and the function might convert? The function might do:\n\n   sum(numbers_list)   -> which will work for integers because they are numbers.\n\n But the function specification says it takes a list of floating-point numbers. So we are allowed to pass integers? The function might convert to float? Or it might not? We don't know the implementation. But the description says \"a list of floating-point numbers\", so we should pass floats.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n   [133.0, 34.0]\n\n But note: in the string, we can write 133.0 or 133? Actually, 133.0 is the same as 133 in integer? But we want to be explicit.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   [133, 34]   and hope the system converts? But the function expects floats.\n\n Since the toolcall is being made by the system, and the system knows the function expects an array of floats, it might convert the integers to floats. But to be safe, we can write them as floats.\n\n However, in the toolcall, we are writing the value as a string. We can write:\n\n   \"[133.0, 34.0]\"\n\n But note: we are putting the array as the text content of the XML element. We don't put quotes? Actually, the value is the text inside the <param> tag. We write:\n\n   <param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n\n But this is not valid XML if we don't escape the brackets? Actually, in XML, the characters '<' and '>' are not allowed in the text without escaping? But the array string does not contain those? It contains brackets. They are allowed in XML character data? Actually, the brackets are allowed as long as they are not part of a tag.\n\n So we can write:\n\n   <param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n\n However, to be safe from any XML parsing issues, we might use CDATA? But the instruction does not specify. And the example does not use CDATA. So we assume it's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the array as a string without brackets? No, we must represent it as an array.\n\n Considering the above, we will call the function with the array of floats.\n\n But note: the function only has one required parameter: numbers_list. So we are good.\n\n Therefore, the toolcall will be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n<param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note: the array is of type array, and we are passing a string representation. The system will parse it. But what if the system expects a different representation? For example, it might expect a list of space-separated values? But the function definition says it's an array.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function is in Python 3, so the array is a Python list. We can write it as a Python list? But the toolcall is in XML and the value is a string. We write the string that represents the array.\n\n We'll go with the above.\n\n But wait: the numbers are 133 and 34. We can also write them as integers? Since the function expects floats, and integers are acceptable? We'll write them as integers to avoid the decimal? Actually, it doesn't matter. We can write:\n\n   [133, 34]   -> and set type=\"array\"\n\n But the function expects floats. The system might convert? Or it might throw an error? We don't know. To be safe, we write as floats.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   [133, 34]   and the system will convert each to float? We are not sure.\n\n Since the function description says \"a list of floating-point numbers\", we should pass floats. So we write 133.0 and 34.0.\n\n However, note: 133.0 is the same as 133. We can write without the decimal? Actually, in the array representation, 133 is an integer and 133.0 is a float. But in JSON, there is no distinction between integer and float? Actually, in JSON, numbers are not typed. They are just numbers. So [133, 34] is acceptable and the function will work because the numbers are numeric.\n\n Therefore, we can write:\n\n   <param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133, 34]</param>\n\n But the function expects an array of floats. In Python, when the function gets [133, 34], it is a list of integers. The function might break? The function is:\n\n   def sum_numbers(numbers_list):\n        return sum(numbers_list)\n\n This function will work for integers and floats. But the function specification says it expects floats. So we are violating the contract? Not exactly, because integers are a subset of real numbers and can be represented exactly as floats. But the function might be designed to only work with floats? Unlikely.\n\n However, to strictly adhere to the function specification, we should pass floats. But note: the function parameter type in the toolcall is array, and we are passing an array of integers? How does the system know? The function expects an array of floats. The system might automatically convert? Or it might throw an error.\n\n We don't know the implementation of the toolcall interpreter. So to be safe, we can pass the numbers as floats by writing them with a decimal point.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n   <param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n\n But note: in the value, we are writing the array as a string. We must ensure that it is a valid representation.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the numbers as strings? No, because the function expects numbers.\n\n We decide to write:\n\n   [133.0, 34.0]\n\n However, we must be cautious: the XML might require escaping of special characters? The array string does not contain any special XML characters (like &, <, >) so it is safe.\n\n Therefore, the final toolcall is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n<param name=\"numbers_list\" type=\"array\">[133.0, 34.0]</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}
