Let me check the available functions. There's the change_food function which takes food_item and modification_request. The modification_request can have multiple requests separated by commas. The user's request is \"no onions, extra cheese\", which fits. So I need to call change_food with food_item as \"burger\" and modification_request as \"no onions,extra cheese\". Wait, the parameters say the modification_request should be a string, and if there are multiple requests, separate with comma and no space. The user's input has a comma with a space, but the function says no space between commas. Wait, the user wrote \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space after the comma. But the function's argument says to separate using comma with no space. So maybe I need to adjust that. But the function's example says \"no peanuts\" or \"extra spicy\", but if there are multiple, like \"no peanuts, extra spicy\". So the user's input has a comma with space, but the function expects comma without space. Wait, the function's description says: \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So the user's input has a comma with a space, which might not be correct. But the user specified the modification verbatim. So maybe I should pass exactly what the user said, even if it's with a space. But the function's parameters say to separate with comma and no space. Hmm, but the user's request is to apply the modifications as they are. So perhaps the function expects the modification_request to be a single string with commas separating the requests, but without spaces. However, the user's input has a comma with a space. But the function's parameter says to separate with comma and no space. So maybe the correct way is to remove the space after the comma. But the user said \"verbatim\", so maybe I should keep it as is. Wait, the function's parameter says that if there are multiple requests, separate with comma and no space. So the user's input has a comma with a space, which might not be correct. But the user wants the modifications verbatim. So perhaps the function expects the modification_request to be a single string with commas separating the requests, but without spaces. Therefore, I need to adjust the user's input to remove the space after the comma. But the user's exact request is \"no onions, extra cheese\". So maybe the function expects that. Wait, the function's parameter says \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So the correct format would be \"no onions,extra cheese\" without space. But the user wrote it with a space. However, the user said \"verbatim\", so maybe I should pass exactly what they wrote. But the function's parameter says that the modification_request should be formatted with commas and no space. So perhaps the correct approach is to process the user's input into the correct format. But the user's instruction says to use the modification verbatim. So maybe the function expects the modification_request to be exactly as the user wrote. But the function's parameter says that if there are multiple requests, separate with comma and no space. Therefore, the user's input has a comma with a space, which is not in line with the function's parameter. But the user wants the modifications verbatim. So perhaps the function is designed to accept the modification_request as a string, and the user's input is to be passed as is. Therefore, the correct call would be to use the function with food_item \"burger\" and modification_request \"no onions, extra cheese\". Even though the function's parameter says to separate with comma and no space, maybe the function can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to accept the comma-separated list, and the user's input is correct. So I'll proceed with the user's exact input."}

The function expects the location in the format 'Address, City, State'. The given address includes the street name, city, state, and ZIP code. The function's example uses 'Address, City, State', so maybe the ZIP code is extra. But the function's parameter description says the format is 'Address, City, State', so perhaps the ZIP is not necessary.

The date should be today's date in India. Since the function's default for movie_date is the current date, I don't need to specify it unless there's a need to adjust.

But since the user explicitly mentioned today, perhaps including it makes it clearer.\n\nThe other parameters: cinema_hall is optional, and the user didn't mention a specific hall. Language and format are also not specified. So, the function call should include city as \"Mumbai\" and movie_date as today's date. Wait, but the function's default is current date, so maybe just providing the city is enough. However, the user might be in a time zone where today's date is different, but the system is set to India's time, so the current date is correct.\n\nSo, the function call would be get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to today. But since the default is already today, maybe just city is sufficient. However, the user explicitly said \"today,\" so including the date parameter ensures that the current date is used. Let me check the function's parameters again. The movie_date has a default of current date, so if the user says \"today,\" it's the same as the default. Therefore, the function call can be made with just the city parameter. But to be explicit, maybe include the date. However, the function's default is already today, so maybe it's better to omit it. Wait, but the user might be referring to a different date, but the question says \"today,\" so the default is correct.\n\nSo the correct function call is get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\". The other parameters are optional and not provided, so they can be left out. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"function\": \"get_movies\", \"parameters\": {\"city\": \"Mumbai\"}}.

The function can handle the command as a string. Since the user provided the exact command, I should use that directly. No parameters needed except the command. \n\nI think that's all. Just call the execute function with the given command."}

The user is looking for a housekeeper who provides ironing services in Bangkok's Chatuchak District with a 4.5-star rating or higher. The available function is get_service_id, which retrieves a service's ID based on type, province, district, and rating.\n\nFirst, I need to map the user's request to the function's parameters. The service type here is ironing, which according to the function's example, corresponds to service_id 2. The province is Bangkok, which is province_id 1. The district is Chatuchak, so district_name should be \"Chatuchak\". The rating required is 4.5, which is within the function's parameter range (0.0 to 5.0).\n\nWait, the function's parameters have default values. The province_id defaults to 1, which is Bangkok. But the user specified Bangkok, so maybe it's safe to include it explicitly. The district_name default is 'Not Specified', but the user provided Chatuchak, so that should be set. The rating is 4.5, which is higher than the default 0.0. So I need to set all these parameters.\n\nSo the function call would be get_service_id with service_id=2 (ironing), province_id=1 (Bangkok), district_name=\"Chatuchak\", and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the service ID for the ironing service in that area with the required rating. I think that's all the parameters needed.

The function get_service_providers seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. The service_id is required, and since the user mentioned ironing services, I need to find the correct service_id. The description says service_id 2 is ironing. So service_id should be 2.\n\nNext, the location is Chonburi Province. The province_id for Chonburi is 3, as per the example. The district_name and sub_district_name aren't specified, so maybe they can be left as default or not provided. But the user didn't mention district or sub-district, so perhaps we don't need to include them unless required. The function parameters allow for those, but since they're not provided, maybe we can omit them.\n\nThe rating is 4.5, which is a float. The start_available_date is 12/03/2024 16:00. The format needs to be 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss', so that would be '2024-03-12 16:00:00'. The end_available_date is 18:00, so '2024-03-12 18:00:00'. \n\nWait, the function's start_available_date default is the current date and time, but the user specified a particular date. So we need to set that. Similarly, end_available_date is optional, but the user provided an end time, so we should include that.\n\nPutting it all together, the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=3, rating=4.5, start_available_date='2024-03-12 16:00:00', end_available_date='2024-03-12 18:00:00'. The district and sub-district are not specified, so they can be omitted. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The user didn't mention district or sub-district, so those parameters can be left out. The function should handle that.
