The user wants an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nFor uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be a street address with city, state. The user provided that exact address. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes. So that fits.\n\nThen there's uber.ride2. It requires loc (city, state), type, and time. The user's loc is a street address, but ride2's loc example is 'Berkeley, CA' without the street. The user's input has the full address, so maybe ride2 isn't suitable here because it's expecting a city and state, not a street address. Also, ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, so that's okay. But since the loc format doesn't match, ride2 might not be the right choice.\n\nSo the correct function is uber.ride with the parameters loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. I should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The user mentioned 'Plus' but the enum in the function uses lowercase 'plus', so need to use the correct case. Also, check if time is an integer. Yes, 10 is an integer. All required parameters are present. So the tool call should be to uber.ride with those parameters."}

The language isn't mentioned, so I'll use the default, which is EN. \n\nWait, the user might prefer Korean results since the query is in Korean. But the function's default language is EN. However, the parameter allows changing the language. The enum options are EN, ES, FR, DE. The user didn't specify, so maybe stick with the default. But maybe the user wants Korean, but since Korean isn't in the enum, perhaps it's not supported. Hmm, maybe the system can't handle Korean language for this search. But the user's query is in Korean, so maybe the results should be in Korean. However, the function's language parameter doesn't include Korean. The options are EN, ES, FR, DE. So the default is EN. I'll proceed with that, but note that the results might not be in Korean. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with English results. \n\nThe main thing is to use HNA_WQA.search with the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format 'text', max_results 10.

The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can be used. The BankStatementOverView function seems right. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user mentioned \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\" as the account name, so account_type is checking. The bank name is U.S. Bank. Account number is given. Full name might be from the company info, but the user didn't provide it. Wait, the user didn't mention the company name. The function parameters require full_name, which is the account holder's name. The user might have provided the company name as part of the account name? Or maybe they need to use another function to get the company name. Wait, the user's message says the account is under the name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. Maybe that's the company name? But the function requires full_name, which is the account holder's name. Hmm, maybe the user didn't provide the full name. Wait, the user might have provided the company name as part of the account name. Alternatively, maybe the full_name is the company name here. Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView's full_name is the account holder's name as recorded by the bank. The user might have provided the company name as SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which could be the full name here. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the full name is known, but since it's not provided, maybe I need to use another function to get it. Wait, the user didn't mention the company name, but the account is under SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. Maybe that's the company name. However, the function requires full_name, which might be the legal name of the business. If the user hasn't provided that, maybe I need to use get_company_info with the company name as SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. But the user hasn't explicitly stated that. Alternatively, maybe the full_name is the same as the account name. Let me proceed with the information given. \n\nThe transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided total deposits $7,132.76 and withdrawals $5,927.40. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So start_date is 2019-10-01, end_date 2019-10-31. \n\nSo the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\" (assuming that's the account holder's name)\ntransaction_overview: {\n    total_deposits: 7132.76,\n    total_withdrawals: 5927.40,\n    start_date: \"2019-10-01\",\n    end_date: \"2019-10-31\"\n}\n\nAlso, the user mentioned the beginning and ending balances, but the BankStatementOverView function doesn't require those. However, the TotalTransactions.calculate function might need them, but the user wants an overview, so maybe BankStatementOverView is sufficient. \n\nWait, the user also wants a summary of transactions for the period. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. They might need to retrieve transactions using Alltransactions function first. But the user hasn't provided the parameters for Alltransactions, which requires the statement_period. The statement period is October 2019, so '2019-10'. But the user hasn't specified if pending transactions should be included. The default is False. However, the user might need to call Alltransactions to get the list of transactions, then use that data in transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, maybe the assistant can't generate the summary without that data. However, the user might expect that the BankStatementOverView includes the transaction summary. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the provided totals and balances to generate a summary. But the transaction_summary.generate requires individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the assistant can't generate that part. However, the user might be expecting that the BankStatementOverView includes the transaction overview, which it does. \n\nSo the main function to call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. The other functions might not be necessary unless more data is needed. Since the user hasn't provided the full_name, but used SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING as the account name, I'll proceed with that as the full_name parameter."}

{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate priced, which I think corresponds to 'moderate' in the price_range enum. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. The user didn't specify the state, but since New York is a city, maybe the state is NY. So location would be 'New York, NY'. The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it as default or check if it's required. Wait, the required parameters are category and location. Oh, the user didn't mention a specific cuisine, so maybe I need to use a default category? Wait, the category is required, but the user didn't specify. Hmm, but the user's query doesn't mention a category. Maybe the function allows a default? Looking back, the parameters for category have an enum list, but there's no default mentioned. So the function requires category. But the user hasn't provided it. Wait, the user's question is about price and seating, not cuisine. Maybe the category can be left as a general term? Wait, no, the function requires category. So perhaps the user's query is missing that parameter. But the user might not know the category. Wait, maybe the function allows a wildcard or a general category? But according to the parameters, category is required and must be one of the enum values. So the user hasn't provided a category, which is required. But the user's request is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating, regardless of cuisine. So maybe the category can be omitted? But the function requires it. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the user intended to leave the category unspecified, but the function requires it. In that case, the assistant can't proceed without that info. However, looking back, the user's message says \"intermediate priced for cost\" which maps to price_range: 'moderate', and has_seating_outdoors: True. The location is 'New York, NY'. But category is required. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant should use a default? But the function doesn't have a default for category. So this is a missing parameter. However, the user might not know the category. Wait, maybe the assistant can use a general category like 'American' or 'Restaurants' but the enum doesn't have 'Restaurants' as an option. The category enum includes options like 'American', 'Italian', etc. So perhaps the assistant can't proceed without that info. But the user didn't provide it. So maybe the assistant should inform the user that the category is required. However, the instructions say that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the user's question is to find restaurants with certain criteria, and the function requires category. So the assistant needs to call the function but the category is missing. Wait, but the user didn't specify a category. So the assistant can't make the call without that. Therefore, the correct response would be to point out that the category is missing. However, looking back, the user's original question is \"I want to find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York\". The user didn't mention a category. So the assistant needs to call the function but the category is required. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the category is missing. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user might not know the category. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default category, but the function doesn't have a default. Therefore, the correct approach is to note that the category is missing. But the user might not have provided it. However, the assistant is supposed to make the function call if possible. Wait, but the function requires category. So without it, the function can't be called. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. However, the user might not have provided it. But the user's question is about price and seating, not cuisine. So maybe the assistant can use a general category, but the function's enum doesn't have a general category. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. But the user might not know the category. So the assistant should inform the user that the category is required. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. But the user's question doesn't mention it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. However, looking back, the function's parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' as required. So the assistant must have that parameter. Since the user didn't provide it, the assistant can't make the call. Therefore, the answer should be that the category is missing. But the user might not know. However, the assistant is supposed to make the function call if possible. Wait, but the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category is required, but the user didn't specify. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. So the answer is that the category is missing. However, the user might not have provided it. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the category is missing. But the user's question is in the context of the functions provided. So the assistant should check if the parameters are present. Since the user didn't provide the category, the assistant can't call the function. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. However, the user might not have provided it. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is required.

The FindMovies function allows searching by location, theater name, genre, and show type. The parameters needed are location, theater_name, genre, and show_type. The location here is Danville, but the format should be \"City, State\". The user mentioned Century Blackhawk Plaza as the theater name. The show_type should be \"imax\" as per the enum in the function.\n\nSo, I should call Movies_1_FindMovies with location set to \"Danville, CA\" (assuming CA as the state abbreviation), theater_name as \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", and show_type as \"imax\". The genre can be left as default 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify a genre. That should retrieve the list of movies available in Imax at that theater."}

The PlayMedia function is for playing a track, which isn't needed here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic, it accepts artist, album, genre, and year.

The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. The event_type can be set to \"Music\" and \"Theater\" separately, but the function might allow multiple types. Wait, the enum for event_type only includes Music and Theater. Since the user wants both concerts and plays, maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each type. But the function's parameters don't specify if multiple types can be queried in one call. The description says \"cultural events, such as concerts and plays,\" so maybe the event_type can be set to a broader category, but according to the parameters, it's restricted to Music or Theater. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can handle both by using a wildcard, but the enum only allows those two. The user wants both, so maybe two separate calls are needed. However, the function might return events of both types if the event_type is set to a general category, but according to the parameters, it's limited to Music and Theater. So to cover both, I should make two separate calls: one with event_type \"Music\" and another with \"Theater\", both in Las Vegas on March 6th. But the user might expect a single query. Wait, maybe the function allows passing both types in one call? The parameters don't mention that. The required parameter is event_type, which is a single string. So I need to make two separate function calls. However, the user might not know that, so perhaps the assistant should handle that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the parameters, it's a single string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can take \"Music\" and \"Theater\" as separate parameters, but the schema shows event_type is a single string. Therefore, the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once for Music and once for Theater. But the user's question is to find events like concerts or plays, which are both covered by Music and Theater. However, the function might return both if the event_type is set to a broader term, but according to the parameters, it's restricted. Therefore, the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the user might not have specified the exact types, but the function requires one of the two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can accept \"any\" as a value, but the enum only includes Music and Theater. The default is not specified here. Wait, looking back, the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents have event_type as required, with enum ['Music', 'Theater']. So the user must choose one. But the user wants both. Therefore, the assistant needs to make two separate function calls. However, the user might not know that, so the assistant should handle that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can be called once with event_type set to \"Music\" and then again with \"Theater\". So the answer would be two function calls. But the user's question is to find events like concerts or plays, which are both Music and Theater. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the function twice with each event_type. However, the system might not allow multiple function calls in one response. Wait, the user's instruction says to make one or more function calls. So the assistant can make multiple calls. \n\nSo the parameters for the first call would be event_type: \"Music\", city: \"Las Vegas\", date: \"2023-03-06\". The second call would be event_type: \"Theater\", same city and date. That way, both types of events are covered. Alternatively, if the function allows combining, but according to the parameters, it's not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is two function calls."}

Wait, the user says \"I would like to hear a track\", which might mean they want it played. But the available functions have LookupMusic and PlayMedia. So perhaps first lookup the songs matching the criteria and then play one. However, the user's message is a single request. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe Music_3_LookupMusic function retrieves a list of songs, and Music_3_PlayMedia plays a track. The user might need to first find the song and then play it. But since the user hasn't specified a particular track, maybe the assistant should first use LookupMusic to find the songs that match the album or year, and then use PlayMedia on one of those tracks. However, the current turn is to make the function calls. The user hasn't provided a track name, so PlayMedia requires a track parameter. Therefore, the first step is to use LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 2019. Once that's done, the system can then use the results to play a track. But in this step, the assistant can only make the Lookup call. So the correct function call here is Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 2019.

They want to hear a song in the Hillbilly style from 2019, and they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" is good.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can search for songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The parameters include genre, which has an enum that includes 'Country' but not 'Hillbilly'. However, 'Hillbilly' is a subgenre of Country, so maybe using 'Country' as the genre is the closest match. The user specified 2019 for the year and the album \"Gotta Be Me\". \n\nWait, the Music_3_LookupMusic function's parameters have 'album' as a parameter, so I can set that to \"Gotta Be Me\". The genre should be 'Country' since 'Hillbilly' isn't in the enum. The year is 2019. The artist is not specified, so default to 'dontcare'. \n\nOnce the lookup is done, the user would need to select a track from the results.

Then, once the user selects a track, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name, but since the user hasn't selected it yet, only the lookup is needed now."}
{"id": "live_multiple_847-179-1", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to book a table for four at Balthazar in New York this Friday at 8 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the necessary functions are available. There's the ReserveRestaurant function. Let me look at its parameters. It requires restaurant_name, location, time, and date. Also, number_of_seats is optional with a default of 2.\n\nThe user provided the restaurant name as Balthazar, location is New York. The time is 8 PM, which in 24-hour format is 20:00. The date is this Friday. I need to figure out the ISO date format for this Friday. Assuming today is Thursday, October 5, 2023, then this Friday would be 2023-10-06. But since the current date isn't provided, maybe the function can handle relative dates, but the parameter expects an ISO string. The user didn't specify the exact date, but said \"this Friday,\" so perhaps the system can resolve that. However, the function requires the date parameter, so I need to make sure it's provided. If the user says \"this Friday,\" the assistant should convert that into the actual date. But since I don't have real-time data, maybe the function expects the user to input the specific date. Wait, the user didn't mention the exact date, just \"this Friday.\" But the function requires the date in ISO format. So maybe the assistant needs to ask for clarification, but according to the instructions, I should make the function call if possible. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle relative dates, but the parameters specify that date is required. Hmm, this might be an issue. The user hasn't provided the exact date, only \"this Friday.\" But the function requires the date in ISO format. So perhaps the assistant should proceed with the best possible date based on the current date. However, since I don't have access to the current date, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the relative term. But the function's parameters require a specific date. This might be a problem. Wait, the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday,\" but the function needs an ISO string. So maybe the assistant should proceed with the given information, assuming that \"this Friday\" can be converted into the correct date. Alternatively, the assistant might need to inform the user that the date is required in ISO format. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's question includes \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. The function requires an absolute date. Therefore, the assistant might need to clarify, but since the task is to make the function call if possible, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the given information, even if the date is relative. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept relative dates, but the parameter description says \"tentative date in ISO format.\" So the assistant needs to have the exact date. Since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant should point out that the date is missing. Wait, but the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a specific date relative to the current date. However, without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute the exact ISO date. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that the date is required in ISO format. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's message includes \"this Friday,\" which is a date, but not in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant should convert \"this Friday\" into the correct ISO date. But since the assistant doesn't have access to the current date, this might not be possible. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask the user to specify the exact date. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. So in this case, the date parameter is required, but the user provided \"this Friday\" instead of an ISO date. Therefore, the assistant should note that the date is missing or not in the correct format. However, the user might expect the assistant to handle relative dates.

Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the date needs to be in ISO format. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make the function call if possible.

However, the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday,\" and the assistant should convert that into the correct date. But without knowing the current date, the assistant can't do that. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the date parameter is missing or not in the correct format. However, the user's question includes \"this Friday,\" which is a date, but not in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the date needs to be in ISO format.

That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the user meant the journey starts on May 15, but the date_of_journey is May 15. The journey_start_time is the time on that day. But the user hasn't provided a time. So the parameters required for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), date_of_journey (May 15, 2023), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (True), and _class (Business). But journey_start_time is missing. The user didn't specify a time. So this is a problem. The function requires journey_start_time. Therefore, the user's question is missing that parameter. However, maybe the user intended that the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 08:00, but since it's not specified, I can't assume. Therefore, I need to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the date_of_journey is May 15, and the journey_start_time is the same day. But without the time, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is not specified, but the function requires it.

The user mentioned their user ID, so that's covered. But the function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens. However, the user wants all tokens, not just shareable ones. \n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function. This one doesn't require any parameters, but it has options like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe setting include_expired to True would get all, but the default is False. However, this function might not require authentication, but the parameters don't include user_id. Wait, the parameters for this function don't have a user_id field. The required parameters are empty, so maybe it's using some authentication context to get the user's tokens. But the user provided their user ID, which might not be needed here. \n\nWait, the first function requires user_id, which the user provided. But the second function doesn't require any parameters. However, the user wants all tokens, and the first function's description mentions shareable tokens, while the second might be more comprehensive. But the user ID is given, so maybe the first function is the right one. However, the user might need to include revoked tokens, so setting include_revoked to True. But the user said \"all API tokens,\" which might include revoked ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function can retrieve all tokens, but since it doesn't take a user_id, perhaps it's using the authenticated user's context. But the user provided their user ID, which might not be necessary here. However, the first function specifically requires user_id, so that's a parameter we can use. \n\nBut the user's main goal is to get all tokens. If the first function is for shareable tokens and the second is for all, then the second function might be the right choice. However, the second function's parameters don't include user_id, so maybe it's designed to be called with authentication, and the user's ID is already known. But the user provided their ID, so maybe the first function is the correct one. \n\nWait, the user might be confused between the two functions. The first one is get_shareable_api_tokens, which might be a subset. The second is get_api_tokens, which might be the full list. But the second function's parameters don't require user_id, so perhaps it's intended to be used without it. However, the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary for the first function. \n\nSo, considering the user's request, they want all tokens. If the second function can retrieve all tokens (including expired) by setting include_expired to True, but the default is False. However, the user might need to use the first function with include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens, but that might not include non-shareable ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function is the correct one to use, even without the user_id, because it's part of the API token API. But the user provided their user ID, which might be needed for the first function. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. The user's user ID is 12345, so I should use the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens, but maybe that's not all. However, the second function might not require the user_id, but the user provided it. Maybe the second function is the right one to get all tokens, but the parameters don't include user_id. \n\nWait, the second function's parameters don't have user_id, so maybe it's designed to be called with authentication, and the user's ID is already known. But the user provided their ID, which might not be needed here. \n\nIn this case, the user is insistent on getting all tokens. The first function might not get all, but the second function's description says \"Retrieve a list of API tokens associated with the user's account.\" So maybe that's the correct one. But since the parameters don't require user_id, perhaps it's okay to call it without. \n\nBut the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary for the first function. However, the second function might not need it. \n\nSo, the best approach is to call the second function with include_expired=True to get all tokens, and also call the first function with include_revoked=True to get shareable tokens, but that might be redundant. However, the user might need both. But the user said \"all API tokens,\" which might be covered by the second function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first function is for shareable tokens, and the second is for all. So to get all, use the second function. But the user provided their user ID, which is not a parameter for the second function. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. The user might need to use the second function, even without the user_id parameter, since it's part of the API token API. So the correct call would be to use api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, page=1, and page_size=100 to get all tokens. But the default page_size is 20, so maybe the user needs to adjust that. However, the user said \"all,\" so maybe set page_size to 100 and include_expired=True. \n\nBut the user's user ID is 12345, but the second function doesn't take that parameter. So perhaps the user's ID is not needed here. \n\nIn conclusion, the user wants all API tokens. The best function to use is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and page_size=100 to get all tokens. However, the user provided their user ID, but that's not a parameter for this function. So the correct call is to use that function with include_expired=True and page_size=100. Alternatively, if the first function is needed, but the user might not have access to it. \n\nBut the user's user ID is given, so maybe the first function is the right one. However, the first function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not be all. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given the parameters, the second function can be called without the user_id, so that's the way to go. So the function call would be to api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, page=1, page_size=100. But the user might need to handle pagination if there are more than 100 tokens. However, the user said \"now,\" so maybe just the first page. But the user might need all, so perhaps the maximum page_size of 100. \n\nAlternatively, the user might need to make multiple calls, but the system might handle that. However, the user's instruction is to make the necessary function calls. So the best approach is to call the second function with include_expired=True and page_size=100 to get as many as possible."}
