It requires:\n\n   - db_name: string\n\n   - backup_location: string\n\n   - timestamp: boolean (optional, defaults to False)\n\nThe description says it's for creating a backup before modification, so it's a good practice to call this first to avoid data loss.\n\nThe user didn't explicitly ask for a backup, but it's a best practice, especially since the function's description mentions it's for before modification. I should consider calling it first.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I can output multiple function calls in one response if needed.\n\nSteps I should take:\n\n1. First, create a backup to be safe.\n\n2. Then, modify the columns by deleting the specified ones.\n\nFor the backup, I need parameters:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\"\n\n- backup_location: The user didn't specify this. The function requires it, so I can't call it without a value. The prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nThe user didn't provide a backup location. So, I shouldn't call database.create_backup because I don't have that parameter.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, I have all required parameters from the user's message:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\"\n\n- table: \"personal_data\"\n\n- operation: \"delete\"\n\n- columns: [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] (assuming these are the column names)\n\nThe user said \"email addresses and social security numbers\", so I'll assume the column names are \"email\" and \"social_security_number\". If not, that's what we'll go with.\n\nSince backup_location is missing, I should not call database.create_backup and proceed with just the modification, or point out the missing parameter.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nI need to only return function calls in the specified format, or if I can't, perhaps not respond with functions. But the prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" And if I decide not to invoke, I shouldn't include anything else.\n\nRe-reading: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I can't invoke due to missing parameters, I should not output anything? That doesn't make sense. The prompt implies I should only output the function calls if I'm invoking them.\n\nIn the initial instructions: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then it says \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis is conflicting. Looking back: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose. If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nI need to handle it. Perhaps in this case, since database.modify_columns can be used, I should call that.\n\nFor the backup, since it's not required by the user, I can skip it.\n\nThe function database.create_backup is available, but missing parameter, so I won't call it.\n\nI'll proceed with calling database.modify_columns.\n\nFunction call format:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"database.modify_columns\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"db_name\" value=\"employees\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"table\" value=\"personal_data\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"operation\" value=\"delete\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"columns\" value=\"['email', 'social_security_number']\" type=\"array\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nFor the columns parameter, it's an array of strings, so value should be something like \"['email', 'social_security_number']\", and type=\"array\".\n\nIn XML, how to represent an array?

In the function description, it gives examples like \"Marriage\", which likely includes divorce as it's a family law matter.\n\nRequired parameters for lawyer.search:\n\n- location: The user specified \"Los Angeles\", but in the function, it's expected as \"Los Angeles, CA\". I should use that format.\n\n- expertise: I need to provide a string for the area of legal expertise. Based on the user's query, \"Divorce\" or \"Marriage\" could work, but I'll go with \"Divorce\" as it's more precise. The example is \"Marriage\", but I think \"Divorce\" is acceptable as it's a common legal expertise.\n\nThe function's description says: \"Area of legal expertise. For example, 'Marriage', 'Criminal', 'Business'.\" It doesn't explicitly list \"Divorce\", but I can infer it's similar. I'll use \"Divorce\" as the value.\n\nSo, I need to call the lawyer.search function with:\n\n- location: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n\n- expertise: \"Divorce\"\n\nMy response should only include the function call in the specified XML-like format:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n...\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n...\n\n</functions>\n\nFor this, it would be:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"lawyer.search\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"Los Angeles, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"expertise\" value=\"Divorce\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nI need to ensure that's the exact format. Also, remember that types should be like \"string\", \"integer\", etc.\n\nThis seems to fulfill the user's request in one function call.\n\nIs there anything missing? The question provides the location as \"Los Angeles\", and I'm assuming \"Los Angeles, CA\" based on common knowledge. The function description says \"e.g. Los Angeles, CA\", so that should be fine.\n\nNo other functions are needed here. Once I call this, the system will handle the response."}

No location parameter.\n\nThe question specifies a location: \"New York public library\", and a genre: \"historical fiction\".\n\nThe most appropriate function is **library.search_books** because it takes both 'location' and 'genre', which match the query.\n\nFor **library.search_books**, the required parameters are:\n\n- location: \"New York public library\" (this can be the string value).\n\n- genre: \"historical fiction\".\n\nThere's an optional 'title', but it's not provided, so I don't need to include it.\n\nI need to format the response as specified: Only return the function calls in the exact XML-like format.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n...\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n...\n\n</functions>\n\nFor this, I'll call **library.search_books** with:\n\n- name: \"library.search_books\"\n\n- params:\n\n  - param name=\"location\" value=\"New York public library\" type=\"string\"\n\n  - param name=\"genre\" value=\"historical fiction\" type=\"string\"\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIs there anything missing? The question doesn't specify a title, so that's fine; it's optional.\n\nI should ensure that this function call addresses the user's query. By calling this, we're searching for books in that library with that genre, which directly answers if such a book can be found.\n\nOnce I make this function call, if needed, I can follow up, but for now, this seems to complete the task.\n\nResponse should only contain the function call, nothing else."}

The user wants 'timings', 'exhibitions', and 'accessibility', which match exactly.\n\nSo, I can call **museum_info** with:\n\n- museum: \"Natural History Museum\" (type: string)\n\n- city: \"London\" (type: string)\n\n- features: An array containing ['timings', 'exhibitions', 'accessibility'] (type: array of strings)\n\nThe function's parameters specify that 'features' is an array, and in the description, it says \"For multiple features, separate them by comma.\", but in the function call format, I need to provide it as an array.\n\nIn the function definition, it's defined as an array, so in my function call, I should represent it as an array.\n\nThe required parameters are 'museum' and 'city', which are provided.\n\nThis seems straightforward. I don't need to call any other functions.\n\nMy response should only include the function call in the specified XML-like format:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"museum_info\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"museum\" value=\"Natural History Museum\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"city\" value=\"London\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"features\" value=\"['timings', 'exhibitions', 'accessibility']\" type=\"array\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nFor the 'features' parameter, since it's an array, I need to specify it correctly. In the value, I should represent it as a string that can be parsed as an array, like \"['timings', 'exhibitions', 'accessibility']\", and the type as \"array\".\n\nThat matches the instructions.\n\nI shouldn't include any other text; just the function call.\n\nThis should complete the user's request in one turn."}

So, I need to provide an array: [\"chicken\", \"mushrooms\"]\n\n- Calories: under 500, so maximum 500.\n\n- Meal: They said \"lunch recipe\", so I can set meal to \"lunch\".\n\nI should make a function call to recipe_search with these parameters.\n\nFormat for the response: I MUST use the exact format specified:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n...\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n...\n\n</functions>\n\nFor recipe_search, it would be:\n\n- name: \"recipe_search\"\n\n- params:\n\n  - ingredients: array of strings, e.g., [\"chicken\", \"mushrooms\"] \u2013 type should be \"array\"\n\n  - calories: 500 \u2013 type \"integer\"\n\n  - meal: \"lunch\" \u2013 type \"string\"\n\nI need to ensure the types are correctly specified as per the instructions: string, integer, etc.\n\nSo, for ingredients: value should be the array, and type=\"array\"\n\nIn XML, how do I represent an array? I think I just put it as a string representation, like [\"chicken\", \"mushrooms\"], and specify type=\"array\".\n\nThis is the only function I need to call right now to fulfill the request.\n\nOnce I call this, if needed, I might get more information, but for now, this should complete the task.\n\nResponse should ONLY contain the function calls, nothing else."}

This seems directly relevant.\n\nFor **recipe.find**, the parameters are:\n\n- **mainIngredient**: A string, required. The user mentioned \"apple pie\", so the main ingredient could be \"apple\".\n\n- **ingredientLimit**: An integer, required. This is the max number of ingredients. The user said \"less than 5 ingredients\", so that would be 4 or less. I need to specify an exact integer for ingredientLimit. The closest I can get is to set it to 4, since \"less than 5\" means up to 4.\n\nThe function requires exactly these parameters.

Vegan is not exactly the same as vegetarian. Vegetarian includes eggs and dairy, while vegan does not. However, the function for Walmart is walmart.vegan_products, which allows categories: ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nThe parameters for walmart.vegan_products include:\n\n- categories: an array of strings, where each string is from ['vegan', 'gluten-free']\n\nSo, I can specify ['vegan', 'gluten-free'] as categories.\n\nBut the user asked for \"vegetarian\", not \"vegan\". Is that a match? The function doesn't have 'vegetarian' as an option. The enum is only ['vegan', 'gluten-free']. So, I can't directly query for vegetarian products.\n\nThe function description is: \"Get available vegan products at specified Walmart store\", but it allows specifying categories like 'vegan' or 'gluten-free'.\n\nThis might be a limitation. I need to check if I can use it as is.\n\nThe user might mean vegan when they say vegetarian, or perhaps I should proceed with what's available.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nThe function requires 'location', which is provided as \"near Denver\", so I can use \"Denver, CO\" as in the example.\n\nFor categories, the user wants \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", but 'vegetarian' isn't an option. The options are only 'vegan' and 'gluten-free'.\n\nSo, I could call the function with ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], but that might not accurately match the request.\n\nI should only return function calls if they match, otherwise point it out. But the response format is strict: I should only return the function calls in the specified XML-like format, or if not, I need to... wait, no, the instructions say: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIt also says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But in the response format, it might mean I need to not output anything, but that contradicts. Wait, no, looking back: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and \"If you decide to invoke any, use this format.\"\n\nPerhaps if I can't, I should not output the <functions> tag.\n\nThe initial prompt: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then it says to only return function calls.\n\nThis is ambiguous, but I think in practice, if I can't use any, I should probably not output anything, or the system might handle it. To be safe, I need to make a decision.\n\nThe exact words: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nAnd then: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nSo, perhaps in the response, if I need to point something out, I have to include text, but the format says not to.\n\nThis is conflicting. Looking closely: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" means that if I'm making a function call, only include that.\n\nFor pointing out, maybe it's implied that I don't make the call.\n\nIn this case, since 'vegetarian' isn't an option, I shouldn't call the function.\n\nI could call it with 'vegan' as the closest match.\n\nBut that might be inaccurate.\n\nThe function allows ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], so if the user wants both, I can pass that, but they said vegetarian, not vegan.\n\nPerhaps I should assume it's a mistake and use vegan.\n\nTo be precise, I think I should not call it because it doesn't exactly match.\n\nThe user said \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", and the function has 'gluten-free', so maybe call it with only 'gluten-free', but that omits vegetarian.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother way: the function is for vegan products, but allows filtering by categories.\n\nThe description is \"Get available vegan products\", but parameters include categories.\n\nPerhaps it's the best I have.\n\nI think the safest is to call walmart.vegan_products with categories ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], as 'vegan' is a subset of vegetarian, but not exact.\n\nSince the function only has 'vegan' as an option for that type, I'll go with it.\n\nSo, I'll proceed to call the function.\n\nParameters needed:\n\n- location: \"Denver, CO\" (as per example)\n\n- categories: ['vegan', 'gluten-free']\n\nThe user said \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", so perhaps ['vegan', 'gluten-free'] is what they mean.\n\nOkay, let's do that.\n\nSo, function call: walmart.vegan_products with location as string \"Denver, CO\" and categories as array [\"vegan\", \"gluten-free\"]\n\nIn the format:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"walmart.vegan_products\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"Denver, CO\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"categories\" value='[\"vegan\", \"gluten-free\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nYes.\n\nFor the value of categories, since it's an array, I need to represent it as a string that looks like an array, as in the example.\n\nIn the prompt, it says: value=\"value1\" so for an array, probably as a JSON-like string.\n\nIn the initial description, it says: for example, value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\", so for array, value should be something like '[\"vegan\", \"gluten-free\"]'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's it."}

The user said \"filed after January 1, 2021\", so I'll use that as the start_date.\n\nIn the function, start_date is the start of the date range, so it should work for \"after\" as it will search from that date onwards.\n\nMy response should only be the function call in the specified XML-like format.\n\nFormat:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n...\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nFor this, I'll call **lawsuit_search** with:\n\n- company: 'Google' (string)\n\n- start_date: 'January 1, 2021' (string)\n\n- location: 'California' (string)\n\n- status: 'ongoing' (string, from the enum)\n\nTypes:\n\n- company: string\n\n- start_date: string\n\n- location: string\n\n- status: string\n\nI need to include the type for each param, like type=\"string\".\n\nThis seems to fulfill the user's request in one call.\n\nOnce I make this call, I don't think I need more functions, as this directly addresses the query.\n\nResponse structure:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"lawsuit_search\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"company\" value=\"Google\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"start_date\" value=\"January 1, 2021\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"California\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"status\" value=\"ongoing\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThat looks correct."}

But the function requires a closed_status as input, which is a boolean. The description says: \"The status of the lawsuit case to be verified.\" This might mean we need to provide what we think it is, or perhaps it's to check against it.\n\nThe function description: \"Verify the details of a lawsuit case and check its status using case ID.\" And the parameter: \"closed_status: The status of the lawsuit case to be verified.\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Does the function take the expected status and verify if it matches? Or is it to check the actual status?\n\nIn the context, the user says: \"verify if it's already closed.\" So, they want to know the status, but the function requires a closed_status parameter.\n\nThe required parameters are ['case_id', 'closed_status'], so I must provide both.\n\nThe user didn't specify what the closed_status should be; they want to verify it. However, according to the function, I have to provide a value for closed_status.\n\nThis might be a problem. The function expects me to input a boolean for closed_status, but the user is asking to check it, not to assert a value.\n\nPerhaps the function is designed to check if the case matches the provided closed_status. For example, if I provide closed_status as true, it will verify if it's closed.\n\nBut the user wants to know if it's closed, so I might need to call it with closed_status as true and see if it matches.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIn this case, the question provides case_id but not closed_status. So, I should point out that it's lacking.\n\nBut my response should only be the function calls, or if not, point it out in the specified way.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nAnd: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nHow do I point it out? The prompt doesn't specify the format for pointing it out. It just says to point it out, but then says to only return function calls.\n\nPerhaps if I can't make a function call, I don't return anything in that format.\n\nLooking back: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <functions>...</functions>. For the types of the parameters in your function calls, you should write them as string, integer, etc. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIt implies that if I don't invoke functions, I shouldn't return that format. But the prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" So, maybe I need to return some text, but it says not to include other text.\n\nThis is conflicting. Perhaps in practice, if I can't, I just don't respond with the function tag.\n\nTo be precise, for this case, since the function requires closed_status, and the user didn't provide it, I should not call the function.\n\nThe user is asking to verify if it's closed, so perhaps I can assume they want to check if it's true.\n\nIn the function call, I need to provide a value. Maybe I can call it with closed_status as true, since they want to verify if it's closed.\n\nThat might make sense: call the function with closed_status=true to check if it is indeed closed.\n\nIf it's not, the function might return that it doesn't match or something.\n\nSince the function is to \"verify the details and check its status\", providing closed_status as true would verify if it's closed.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- name: lawsuit.check_case\n\n- params: \n\n  - case_id: 1234, type integer\n\n  - closed_status: true, type boolean  (assuming we want to check if it's closed)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I'll prepare the function call.\n\nFormat:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"lawsuit.check_case\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"case_id\" value=\"1234\" type=\"integer\"/>\n\n<param name=\"closed_status\" value=\"true\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThat seems correct."}
