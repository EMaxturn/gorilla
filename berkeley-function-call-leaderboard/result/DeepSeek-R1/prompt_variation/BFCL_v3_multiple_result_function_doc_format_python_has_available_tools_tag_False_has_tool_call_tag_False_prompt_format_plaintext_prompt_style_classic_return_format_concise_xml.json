But note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns one price (presumably the current price) for the game on that platform in that region.\n\n Since the question is about the PlayStation Store in the United States, we can use:\n   game_title = 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n   platform = 'PlayStation'\n   region = 'United States'\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for that game in that store. However, the question says \"cheapest\". \n However, in a given platform and region, there is typically one store (the PlayStation Store for the US) and one price for the game at a time? \n But note: the PlayStation Store might have different editions (like standard, deluxe) and that could lead to multiple prices? However, the function does not specify edition.\n\n Since the function `video_games.store_price` does not take an edition parameter, it likely returns the base game price. Also, the question does not specify an edition.\n\n Alternatively, if the store has multiple listings for the same game (like different editions) then we might need to get multiple prices and then choose the cheapest? \n However, the function `video_games.store_price` does not return multiple prices. It returns the price for the specified game. \n\n Given the function description, it seems to assume one price per game per platform per region? \n\n But note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\". This might imply that there are multiple prices? However, in the context of a single store (PlayStation Store) and a single region (US), the game might be listed only once? Or it might have multiple versions (like standard, gold, etc.)?\n\n Since the function does not allow for specifying edition, and we are not provided with a function to list all editions and their prices, we have to assume that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the base game price or the only available price? \n\n Alternatively, the function might return the lowest price among the available editions? The documentation does not specify.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we can proceed by calling the function for the base game and hope it returns the base game price. But note: the question says \"cheapest\". \n\n However, the user might be interested in the base game. Since the question does not specify an edition, we can assume the base game.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` does not have an argument for edition. So we can only get one price.\n\n Therefore, we can call the function with the provided arguments and return that price. However, the question says \"cheapest\", which might be the same as the only price we get.\n\n Steps:\n   We are going to call `video_games.store_price` with:\n        game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n        platform: 'PlayStation'\n        region: 'United States'\n\n However, note that the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region of United States. So we could omit region? But the question specifies the United States, so we can set it.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` has region as an argument with default 'United States'. So we can set it to 'United States' to be explicit.\n\n But wait: the question asks for the cheapest selling price. Is there a possibility that the same game has multiple listings in the same store? For example, the standard edition and a bundle? Without a function to list all editions, we cannot get multiple prices.\n\n Therefore, we can only get the price for the base game? How does the function `video_games.store_price` behave? We don't know. \n\n Since we are constrained by the available functions, we will call `video_games.store_price` and hope that it returns the base game price, which is the one the user is likely asking for.\n\n However, note that the question says \"cheapest\". If there are multiple editions, we are not getting the cheapest among them but just one. \n\n But we don't have a function to get multiple editions. So we have to use the available function.\n\n Alternatively, we might note that the function `video_games.on_sale` could be used to check if the game is on sale, but that doesn't help with multiple editions.\n\n Since the problem is under-constrained, we'll proceed with the base call.\n\n But note: the question does not specify an edition. So we are returning the price of the base game? Or the only version? We don't know.\n\n We'll make the call and then return the result.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n In this case, we have the required parameters: game_title, platform, and region (which is defaulted but we are providing).\n\n So we call the function.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` might be needed to get the currency? Because the price might be a number without currency? However, the question does not ask for currency, it asks for the price. The function `video_games.store_price` returns the selling price. We don't know the format of the return value? But the question does not specify currency.\n\n We are only required to return the function call.\n\n We are going to make one function call.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price. We are not doing any comparison with other platforms? The question is specific to PlayStation Store in the US.\n\n Therefore, we call `video_games.store_price` with the given parameters.\n\n Let's write the function call in the required XML format."}

Our values are integers.\n\n But wait: the function `kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest` expects `distance` and `time` as integers, and `initial_speed` as integer (default 0). We can pass the parameters accordingly.\n\n However, note the problem: the function name is `calculate_speed_from_rest` and it returns the speed (which is the final speed) of the object.\n\n Therefore, we can use this function.\n\n Let's write the function call in the required XML format.\n\n Important: We are to output only the function call in the specified format.\n\n We have one function to call: kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with parameters:\n   name=\"distance\", type=\"integer\", value=20\n   name=\"time\", type=\"integer\", value=4\n\n Since initial_speed is defaulted to 0, we can omit it. But if we want to be explicit, we can include it. However, the problem says \"started from rest\", so initial_speed=0. The function has a default, so we can skip.\n\n But note: the function signature in the docstring says:\n   distance (int): ...\n   time (int): ...\n   initial_speed (int, default=0): ...\n\n So we can call without initial_speed.\n\n Alternatively, we can include it. Since the user explicitly said \"started from rest\", including initial_speed=0 is also acceptable.\n\n However, the problem does not require any other parameters. We'll stick to the required and provided.\n\n We are only required to provide distance and time? Actually, the function has a default for initial_speed, so we can omit.\n\n But let's check: the function requires two parameters: distance and time. The third is optional.\n\n So we call:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\">\n      <param name=\"distance\" type=\"integer\">20</param>\n      <param name=\"time\" type=\"integer\">4</param>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n Alternatively, if we want to be explicit about the initial speed:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\">\n      <param name=\"distance\" type=\"integer\">20</param>\n      <param name=\"time\" type=\"integer\">4</param>\n      <param name=\"initial_speed\" type=\"integer\">0</param>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n However, the function has a default and the problem says \"started from rest\", so either way is acceptable. But note: the function expects initial_speed to be an integer. We can omit it because the default is 0.\n\n Since the problem does not specify any other initial speed, we can omit. But to be safe, we can include it because the problem explicitly says \"started from rest\".\n\n However, the instructions say: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. Here we have the required parameters (distance and time). The initial_speed is optional.\n\n Therefore, we can do without it. But let's see: the function is named \"calculate_speed_from_rest\", so it is designed for rest (initial_speed=0). So we can skip.\n\n I will choose to omit the initial_speed because it's the default and the function is designed for rest.\n\n However, note: the function's docstring says it calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest. So the function might internally set initial_speed=0. But the parameter is there and we can set it to 0 to be explicit.\n\n Since the problem says \"started from rest\", it is clear. We can do either.\n\n But the function call in the example format does not require optional parameters. We can call with just the two required.\n\n However, let's be cautious: the function might require the initial_speed to be passed? Actually, the docstring says it has a default. So we can omit.\n\n We'll go with:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\">\n      <param name=\"distance\" type=\"integer\">20</param>\n      <param name=\"time\" type=\"integer\">4</param>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n But note: the function expects integer types. Our values are integers.\n\n However, what if the function internally uses floats? The problem does not specify. But the function signature says integer.\n\n We are given integers: 20 and 4.\n\n Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n Alternatively, if we are not sure, we might consider using kinematics.calculate_acceleration? But we don't have final_speed to calculate acceleration? \n\n Actually, we have the equation of motion for constant acceleration:\n\n   v = u + a*t\n   s = u*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n\n We are given u=0, s=20, t=4. We can solve for a and then for v.\n\n But we have a function that directly calculates the speed from rest given distance and time. That function must be using the appropriate equation.\n\n So we use the direct function.\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}

We omit it or set to 0.\n\n We are to output the function call in the specified XML format.\n\n Note: The function name in the call must be exactly as provided, including the module if present (i.e., \"finance.calculate_future_value\").\n\n Since the question does not mention any contributions, we can skip the 'contribution' parameter or set it to 0. However, the function definition says that the default is 0, so we can omit it. But note: the tool call format requires that we include parameters? Actually, the function definition says \"contribution\" is optional and default is 0. Since the user did not specify, we can omit it.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the required parameters (initial_investment, rate_of_return, years) are provided, and the optional one (contribution) is not.

Since the user did not specify, we can omit it. Alternatively, if we want to be explicit, we could set it to 0. However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" This is not the case because the required parameters are present and the optional one has a default.\n\n Since the instruction does not require including optional parameters when they are not provided, we can omit them.\n\n Therefore, we output the above XML without the contribution parameter.\n\n Let me write the function call accordingly."}

Let's break down the parameters we have:\n   - location: We are told \"New York\", so we can set location to \"New York, NY\" (as per the example in the function's docstring).\n   - art_form: The task mentions \"modern sculpture\". Since the function has an `art_form` parameter, we can set it to \"sculpture\". \n     However, note that the function does not have a parameter for \"modern\". But we can assume that the function might consider the time (month) and ratings to be top rated, which might imply modern? \n     Alternatively, we might need to filter by modern in a different way. But the function does not have a period or era parameter. \n     Since we cannot specify \"modern\" in the function, we might have to rely on the function's own criteria for including such exhibitions and then later filter? \n     However, note: the function's `art_form` is a string. We can try to be more specific: \"modern sculpture\". But the function's docstring example is \"sculpture\". \n     We are not sure if the function accepts \"modern sculpture\" as a valid art_form. But we can try.\n\n   - month: The task says \"upcoming month\". The function's `month` parameter defaults to returning upcoming events. So we can leave it as default? \n     But note: the function's `month` parameter is a string and has a default that returns upcoming events. So we can omit it? \n     However, in the function call we are required to set parameters. We can set it to the current month or next month? \n     But the function says \"Default value will return upcoming events\". So if we don't provide it, it would be the same. \n     But note: the function call in our format must specify the parameters we are using. We are allowed to skip parameters that have defaults? \n     Actually, in the function call we can skip parameters that have defaults if we are okay with the default. But in our XML format, we must only include the parameters we are setting? \n     However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n     But here, the function has a default for `month` and `user_ratings`. So we can skip them? But note: the user wants \"upcoming month\", which is exactly the default.\n\n   - user_ratings: We want top rated, so we can set this to 'high'. The function's default is 'high'. So we can also skip it? \n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` returns the most popular exhibitions. The task asks for \"top rated\", which matches the `user_ratings` being set to high.\n\n But we have a problem: the function does not have a parameter for \"modern\". How do we handle that?\n   Option 1: We assume that the function's database of exhibitions might have a field for era and we can include it in the `art_form`? \n        We try: art_form = \"modern sculpture\"\n   Option 2: We call the function without specifying modern, and then later we might have to filter? But we cannot call multiple functions arbitrarily? \n        We are only allowed to output one set of function calls per turn? And then the system will run and we can do more in the next turn? \n        But the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n However, note that we are only allowed to use the provided functions. We don't have a function to filter by era. \n\n So we try to use the function with:\n   location = \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form = \"sculpture\" OR \"modern sculpture\"? \n\n Let's look at the function: `find_exhibition` has an `art_form` parameter. The example is \"sculpture\". We don't know if it supports compound terms. \n Since the problem says \"modern sculpture\", and we cannot break it down, we have to hope that the function can handle it? \n\n Alternatively, we can call the function with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then in the results we might get a mix of modern and non-modern? \n But we don't have a way to filter by modern in the function. \n\n Considering the task: we are to find the top rated modern sculpture exhibition. We must include \"modern\" in the criteria.\n\n Since the function does not have an era parameter, we might have to rely on the function's own interpretation of `art_form`. \n We can try to set `art_form` to \"modern sculpture\" and see if the function supports it? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function `find_exhibition` returns the most popular exhibitions, and we are setting user_ratings to high (by default). \n And we are setting location and art_form. But without modern, we might not get modern. \n\n But wait: there's another function `get_sculpture_info` that retrieves artwork by an artist. But that doesn't seem to help for exhibitions.\n\n We have to make a decision: we call `find_exhibition` with art_form=\"modern sculpture\". If the function doesn't support it, we might get an error? \n But we are not told the exact allowed values. \n\n Alternatively, we can break the task into two? \n   Step 1: Use `find_exhibition` to get exhibitions in New York for art_form=\"sculpture\", and then we hope that the description of the exhibition might include the word \"modern\"? \n   But we cannot do that in one function call. \n\n Given the constraints, we must use the function as best as we can.\n\n Let's set:\n   location = \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form = \"modern sculpture\"\n   month: we leave it to default (so we don't pass it) but note: the function has a default. However, in the XML we are required to pass only the parameters we set? \n   But the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" -> but we are not lacking because the function has defaults.\n\n However, note: the function's `month` parameter is described as: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" \n Since we are interested in the upcoming month, we don't need to set a specific month. So we can skip it.\n\n Similarly, user_ratings: we want top rated, so we can set it to 'high'. But the default is 'high'. So we can skip it? \n\n But let's look at the function signature: \n   find_exhibition(location, art_form, month='default_value', user_ratings='high')\n\n However, in the XML we must include only the parameters we are setting? Or we can include all? \n\n The instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and the format includes the parameters we want to set.\n\n We are required to set the parameters that are necessary for the function to do what we want? And skip the ones that are optional and we are okay with the default.\n\n So we will set:\n   location = \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form = \"modern sculpture\"\n\n But note: the function requires `location` and `art_form`? The function does not mark them as optional? So we must set them.\n\n We are not setting `month` and `user_ratings` because we are okay with the defaults.\n\n However, the function call in the XML format must only include the parameters we are setting? Or we have to set all? \n\n The instruction says: \"You MUST put it in the format of <functions>...\". It doesn't say we have to set every parameter. We set the ones that are required and the ones we want to change from default.\n\n But note: the function's `art_form` is required? The function does not have a default for `art_form`? The docstring doesn't mark it as optional. So we must set it.\n\n Similarly, `location` is required.\n\n So the function call will be:\n\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n         <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n         <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">modern sculpture</param>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n\n But wait: the function has a `month` parameter that we are skipping? And `user_ratings` we are skipping? That's acceptable because they have defaults.\n\n However, what if the function does not support \"modern sculpture\" as an art form? We don't have control over that. We are doing the best we can.\n\n Alternatively, we can try without \"modern\"? But then we might not get modern. \n\n Since the task specifically says \"modern\", we have to try to include it.\n\n Another idea: maybe the function `find_exhibition` has a way to search by keywords? But we don't see that in the parameters. \n\n So we go with the above.\n\n But note: the function returns the most popular exhibitions. We are setting user_ratings to default 'high', which is what we want.\n\n We are not setting month, so we get upcoming events (which is the upcoming month?).\n\n Therefore, we output the function call accordingly.\n\n However, note: the function might return multiple exhibitions? But the task asks for the top rated. The function is designed to return the most popular (which we assume is top rated). \n So we are getting the top rated ones? And then we can pick the top one? But the function doesn't have a parameter for how many? \n\n We don't know how the function returns. It might return a list. But we are not allowed to do further processing? \n The system will run the function and then we can see the result? But the instruction says we can continue to output functions until we have fulfilled the request.\n\n So in this turn, we output the function call. Then in the next turn, we might get the result and then we can decide if we need to do more? \n\n But the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" \n And we are only allowed to output function calls. We cannot process the result. \n\n So we output the function call and then the system will return the result? And then we can output more function calls if needed? \n\n However, in this case, we are only making one function call. We hope that the function returns one or more exhibitions and we can then present the top one? \n\n But note: the function says \"Locate the most popular exhibitions\", so it returns a list of exhibitions? We don't have a way to get the top one? \n\n We are not told how the function returns. But we assume it returns the exhibitions in order of popularity? \n\n So we can just take the first one? But we cannot do that in the function call? \n\n We are not allowed to write code. We are only allowed to call the functions. \n\n So we call the function and then the system will show the result? \n\n But the task says: \"Find the top rated modern sculpture exhibition\" - meaning we are to return one? \n\n The function does not have a parameter for limiting the number of results. \n\n Therefore, we have to hope that the function returns the top one first? \n\n Alternatively, we might have to do another step? But we don't have a function to sort or limit? \n\n We are stuck? \n\n But note: the function is designed to return the most popular, so the first one in the list is the top? \n\n We'll assume that.\n\n So we output the function call as described.\n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` might not accept \"modern sculpture\". We are taking a risk.\n\n But we have no alternative. \n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}
