There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the function ChaFod is needed. The parameters are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user says \"without anchovies,\" so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". The foodItem is Caesar salad. The specialInstructions might be \"no anchovies\" but the function's default is empty, so I'll set that.\n\nThen for the drink, the function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences should include the drink type (coffee), size (large), temperature (hot), sweetness (regular), and milk (almond).

The unit is metric, which is the default, so maybe I can omit it. Then same for Beijing, \"Beijing, China\" or \"Beijing, CN\". \n\nI should make two separate function calls. The parameters are location and unit. Since unit is default metric, maybe I don't need to specify it. But the function's default is metric, so including it might be safe.

The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions I can use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function seems perfect here. The parameters needed are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. Since the user didn't specify the destination, I'll use the default which is the current directory. Recursive and depth are optional, so I'll leave them as default unless specified. So the first function call would be clone_repo with repo_url set to the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name. But the user hasn't specified the directory name yet. Wait, the repo was cloned into the current directory, so maybe the directory name is the cloned repo's path. But the function's argument is directory_name, which should be a valid path relative to the root. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's name. However, the user might have a specific directory in mind. But since the problem says \"based on the analysis,\" perhaps the analysis is done first. But the user hasn't provided the directory name yet. Hmm, maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's name. So I'll use the cloned repo's name as the directory_name for create_a_docker_file.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. Again, the directory_name is the cloned repo's name. The deployment_name and image_name are defaults if not provided. So I'll use the cloned repo's name as directory_name, and the defaults for other parameters unless specified. But the user might need to set some parameters, but since they aren't mentioned, I'll use defaults.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory_name is the cloned repo's path. The commit message is default 'Update changes', branch is 'main', and force_push is default False. So this function call would be push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen step 4 is to commit and push. But the push_git_changes_to_github function already handles pushing, so after adding the changes, the commit and push would be done by that function.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention committing and pushing. So the order would be: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes, commit and push.\n\nBut the functions need to be called in the order of the steps. Let me check each function's parameters again.\n\nFor clone_repo: repo_url is given, destination is default, so call clone_repo with repo_url.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file: directory_name is the cloned repo's name. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, maybe the directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' or the exact path. But the user's repo URL is 'zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so the directory name might be 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory. So create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' again. The other parameters are defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it pushes all changes, so that's covered.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='.')\n2. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the directory_name is correct. The cloned repo is in the current directory, so the directory_name for create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file would be the same as the cloned repo's name. However, the user's repo URL is 'zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so the directory name might be 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory. So the function calls are as above.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check if any parameters are missing. For example, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file has defaults for deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user didn't specify those, so using defaults is okay.\n\nYes, that should cover all steps."}

They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The user provided four functions: get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe first part of the question is about finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search_string should be 'CellResult', case_sensitive is default False, and include_subdirectories is True. So I'll call get_relevant_classes with these parameters.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function is for retrieving method signatures. The parameters are class_name, method_name, and include_private. For 'setCellValue', class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler' and method_name is 'setCellValue'. Similarly for 'getCellValue'. Since the user is overriding these methods, they need to ensure the signatures are correct. So I'll call get_signature twice, once for each method.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'AbstractCellHandler' as the class, so I need to make sure the function parameters are correctly set. The function get_signature requires class_name and method_name.

Then call get_signature twice, once for each method. That should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\". The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I'll use the default, which is Fahrenheit.
