The original function parameters for ChaFod include foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"without anchovies,\" so I need to remove anchovies. The foodItem is Caesar salad. So, I'll call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nThen for the drink: The drink ID is 123. The new preferences are large hot coffee, regular sweetness, and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function requires drink_id and new_preferences as a dictionary. So, drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences should be a dict with \"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"type\": \"coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\". \n\nWait, the parameters for ChaDri.change_drink's new_preferences are a dict.

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I'll need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url and destination. The user didn't specify a destination, so I'll leave it as the default, which is the current working directory.\n\nNext step is to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function is needed here. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the path relative to the root. Since we cloned the repo into the current directory, maybe the directory name is \"nodejs-welcome\" or just the current directory. Wait, the function's description says the directory name should be a valid path relative to the root. So if the repo was cloned into the current working directory, the directory name would be the name of the cloned repo, which is \"nodejs-welcome\". So I'll use that as the parameter.\n\nAfter analyzing, the next tasks are creating a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. For the Dockerfile, the create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name where the Dockerfile is created. Since the analysis was done on the repo directory, maybe the Dockerfile is created in the same directory. So the directory_name here would be the same as the repo directory, \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen, creating Kubernetes YAMLs with create_kubernetes_yaml_file. The directory_name parameter here is the name of the directory where the repo is located, which again is \"nodejs-welcome\". The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type are optional. The user didn't specify any, so I'll use the defaults. The deployment name would default to the directory name, which is \"nodejs-welcome\", and the image name would be \"latest\". Replicas, port, and service_type are not provided, so they can be left as default or maybe set to common values. But since the user didn't specify, I'll just use the defaults as per the function's parameters.\n\nThen, after creating the files, the user wants to add all changed files to Git. But the functions available don't include a 'add changes' function. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function has a parameter for directory_name, but adding changes is part of the git process. However, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which might be implied by the push function, but the push function automatically does git add. However, the user might need to run git add before pushing. But since the functions provided don't have a separate 'add' function, maybe the push function handles it. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a 'git add' function. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe that's the function to use here. But the user's step 3 is to add all changed files, then commit and push. However, the push function might handle both adding and committing. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. But the functions available don't have a commit function. The push function might handle the commit as part of the process. So perhaps the user's step 3 is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name and a commit message. The user didn't specify the commit message, so maybe use a default or leave it as empty. But the function's parameters have commit_message as optional. So I'll need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name as \"nodejs-welcome\" and maybe a commit message like \"Updated Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\".\n\nPutting it all together, the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git and destination as default.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\" and possibly a commit message.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be part of the push function's process. So the push function would handle adding and committing. So the steps would be:\n\nAfter creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, the user needs to add the changes, then commit and push. But the available functions don't have a separate 'add' function. However, the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So the push function would handle that. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. However, the push function might handle both adding and committing. So the push function is called after creating the files. Therefore, the correct sequence is the five functions as above."}

They're getting a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', etc. But the error is related to 'CellResult', so I need to figure out why that's happening.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and the method signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe functions provided are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nFor the first part, finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult', the get_relevant_classes function seems appropriate. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The user wants to include subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to true. The search string is 'CellResult'.\n\nThen, for the method signatures, the user needs the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. But wait, the get_signature function requires the class name, method name, and include_private. Since the user is overriding these methods, they need to check the original class's method signatures. So, I should call get_signature for each method in 'AbstractCellHandler'. \n\nBut wait, the get_signature function's parameters are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user is asking about 'AbstractCellHandler', so class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. The include_private parameter is optional, but since the user is overriding methods, they might need to check if these methods are public or not. However, the user hasn't specified whether they need private methods, so maybe default to false unless told otherwise. \n\nSo, I need to make two separate calls to get_signature for each method. Also, the user might need to check if 'AbstractCellHandler' has these methods. But the function will handle that. \n\nAdditionally, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class is part of the relevant classes found, but the user hasn't found it yet. So first, they need to find classes related to 'CellResult', which would include that class. Then, perhaps check the method signatures of 'CellResult' to see if 'getNumericValue' exists. But the user's error is that the method is not found, so maybe the 'CellResult' class doesn't have that method. However, the user's question is about finding relevant classes and the method signatures of 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true to find related classes.\n2. Use get_signature on 'AbstractCellHandler' for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' to get their signatures.\n\nTherefore, the function calls should be:\n\nget_relevant_classes(search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True)\nget_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue')\nget_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue')\n\nThat should address both parts of the user's request. The first part finds relevant classes, including 'CellResult' if it exists. The second part gets the method signatures to ensure correct overriding."}

That should calculate 5 squared, which is 25.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. That might be a mistake. However, the function get_current_weather needs a location. The user specified \"Queenstown Singapore\", which is a bit confusing. But the function accepts locations like 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. So I'll use \"Queenstown, Singapore\" as the location. The unit isn't specified, so maybe default to Celsius or leave it out. The function's unit parameter is optional, so I can omit it. \n\nBut wait, the user might have mixed up Queenstown (New Zealand) with Singapore.

So I need to specify the event_type as either music or theater, but the user is asking for both. Hmm, maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. Or maybe the function can handle a list. But the function's description says it lists events, so perhaps it can return multiple types. But the parameters require a specific event_type. So maybe I need to make two separate calls: one for \"music concert\" and another for \"theater play\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be a broader category.
