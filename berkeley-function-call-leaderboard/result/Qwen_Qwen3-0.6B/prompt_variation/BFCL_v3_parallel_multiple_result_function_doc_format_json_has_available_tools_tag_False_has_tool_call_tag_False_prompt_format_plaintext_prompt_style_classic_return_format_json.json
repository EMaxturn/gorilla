That matches.\n\nFor the second part, biological.calc_biomass uses the same energy and efficiency.

Then there's a compound interest option with $3000 at 3.5% for 6 years compounded annually. And another option with $3000 at 5% for 6 years compounded twice a year. The functions available are calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are required for each option. For the simple interest, the parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate. The user provided all three options, so I can use each function once. For the compound interest, the parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. The third option mentions compounding twice a year, so compound_freq should be 2. The future_value function is for calculating future value, which might be needed for the third option as well. \n\nWait, the user mentioned three options. Let me list them again. The first is simple interest, second is compound interest with annual compounding, third is compound interest with compounding twice a year. So each of these three options requires a separate function call. \n\nSo for the first option, call calc_Simple_Interest with principle=5000, duration=5, rate=4. For the second, calc_Compound_Interest with principle=3000, duration=6, rate=3.5, compound_freq=1. For the third, calc_Compound_Interest again with principle=3000, duration=6, rate=5, compound_freq=2. Then use future_value for the third option? Wait, the user said \"future_value\" for each. Wait, the third option is an initial amount of $3000 at 5% for 6 years with compounding twice a year. The future_value function's parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate, time, num_compoundings. So maybe the third option's future_value is needed here. But the user mentioned three options: the first is simple, second is compound, third is compound again. So perhaps the third option's future_value is also required. But the user's question says \"calculate the returns for each of these options using the functions\". So maybe each function is called once. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"the returns for each of these options\". So each option's return is calculated using one of the functions. So the three options are:\n\n1. Simple interest: calc_Simple_Interest\n2. Compound interest (annual compounding): calc_Compound_Interest\n3. Compound interest (compounded twice a year): calc_Compound_Interest\n\nBut the third option's parameters are different. So the three function calls would be:\n\nFirst: principle_amount=5000, duration=5, rate=4.\n\nSecond: principle_amount=3000, duration=6, rate=3.5, compound_freq=1.\n\nThird: principle_amount=3000, duration=6, rate=5, compound_freq=2.\n\nThen, the future_value function might be used for the third option? Wait, the future_value function's parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate, time, num_compoundings. So maybe the third option's future_value is also needed. But the user's question says \"calculate the returns for each of these options using the functions\". So perhaps the third option's return is calculated using future_value. But the user's question lists three options, each with their own function. So maybe the third option's return is calculated using future_value. But the user's question says \"future_value\" for each. Wait, the user's question says \"the returns for each of these options using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively?\" So each option uses one of these functions. So the three options are:\n\n1. Simple interest: calc_Simple_Interest\n2. Compound interest (annual): calc_Compound_Interest\n3. Compound interest (twice a year): future_value?\n\nWait, the third option is \"invest an initial amount of $3000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year\". So the parameters for that would be initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=5, time=6, num_compoundings=2. So the future_value function would be called here. But the user's question says \"future_value\" for each. So maybe the third option's return is calculated using future_value. Therefore, the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest with the first parameters.\n2. calc_Compound_Interest with the second parameters.\n3. future_value with the third parameters.\n\nBut the user's question lists three options, each with their own function.

The calculate_probability function requires total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4, and round_to is 3. So I need to call that function with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function's required parameters. For modify_painting, size, medium, dominant_color are required. For prediction.evolution, species, years, model. For calculate_probability, total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, round_to. All parameters are provided in the user's question. So the three function calls should cover all parts."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, and built in 1985. The function predict_house_price requires area, rooms, year, and location. All these parameters are provided, so I can use that.\n\nNext, they need information about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the default state is California, but the user specified San Francisco, maybe the county is already San Francisco. So I'll call lawsuit_search with entity 'John Doe', county 'San Francisco', and state 'California'.\n\nThen, the probability part. The user provided total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The round_to is 3 decimal places, which matches the user's request. So calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. Let me check each function's required parameters again. For predict_house_price, all required are present. For lawsuit_search, entity and county are required, and state is optional. The user mentioned San Francisco county, so including state might be redundant but necessary. The user's question says \"county of San Francisco\", so including state as California makes sense. Similarly, the lottery probability uses total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes as given.\n\nSo the three function calls should be: predict_house_price, lawsuit_search, and calculate_probability. Each with the correct parameters. No missing parameters here. The user didn't mention anything about the state for the lawsuit, but since the county is San Francisco, maybe the state is California. The function's parameters include state as a required field? Wait, looking back, the lawsuit_search parameters are entity, county, and state is a required parameter? Wait, no, the parameters for lawsuit_search are entity, county, and state is a required parameter? Wait, no, the parameters for lawsuit_search are required ['entity', 'county'], and state is optional. So the user's county is San Francisco, so including state as California is optional. So the function call would be lawsuit_search with entity 'John Doe', county 'San Francisco', and state 'California' (optional). But since the user specified the county, maybe just county is enough. The function's required fields are entity and county. So maybe just entity and county. The user's question says \"in the county of San Francisco\", so county is San Francisco. So the lawsuit_search call would be with entity 'John Doe', county 'San Francisco'.\n\nSo the three function calls are:\n\n1. predict_house_price with area 2000, rooms 4, year 1985, location San Francisco.\n\n2. lawsuit_search with entity 'John Doe', county 'San Francisco'.\n\n3. calculate_probability with total_outcomes 1000, favorable_outcomes 5, round_to 3.\n\nI think that's all. No parameters are missing. The user's question includes all required parameters for each function. So the answer should include these three function calls."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Looking at the available functions, there's 'get_collectables_in_season' which requires the game name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'Animal Crossing' and 'Summer', so I'll use those. The item_type here is 'fish', so I need to set that.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The function 'game_score.highest' needs the game, platform, and region. The game is Fortnite, platform is PlayStation, and region is Asia. So that's another function call.\n\nThird, the lawsuit details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The 'lawsuit_details.find' function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user mentioned Apple Inc. and 2018, but no case_type specified. The default is all, so maybe I can omit that. So I'll call that function with the parameters.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The 'calculate_binomial_probability' function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. All parameters are present, so that's straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the parameters. Let me check again each step to avoid any missing parameters. All required parameters are included except for case_type in the lawsuit, which defaults to all. So the function calls should be correct."}
