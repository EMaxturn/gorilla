Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function which takes directed_by, genre, and cast as parameters. The user specified the director as James Gray, so I should set directed_by to \"James Gray\". They didn't mention genre or cast, so I'll use \"dontcare\" for those parameters to ensure all genres and casts are considered. That should retrieve a list of movies directed by James Gray without filtering by genre or cast."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the play_spotify_song function. The parameters required are query, shuffle (optional), and volume (optional). The query needs to be in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName'. So I should structure the query as 'track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar'. The user didn't mention shuffle or volume, so those can be omitted. Just need to call the function with the correct query."}

The function's date format is dd/mm/yyyy, so that's 16/03/2024. The time is 14:00, which is in 24-hour format. All required parameters are present. The date is after the 14th of March, so that's valid. I can call the book_flight function with these parameters."}
