Since they want two sixes in a row, I need to multiply the probability of each individual event. So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the functions provided, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters. The function requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides which defaults to 6. The user is asking about rolling a six (desired_number=6) twice (number_of_rolls=2) on a six-sided die. Since die_sides is optional and defaults to 6, I don't need to specify it unless the die has a different number of sides. \n\nSo the correct function call would be probability.dice_roll with desired_number=6 and number_of_rolls=2. The die_sides is already 6 by default, so no need to include it. That should calculate the probability correctly. I don't see any missing parameters here. The user's question provides all necessary info. So the function call should be made with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the find_card_in_deck function. The parameters needed are rank, suit, and optionally deck. The required ones are rank and suit. Since the user didn't specify a custom deck, the function will use a standard 52-card deck by default. So I need to call find_card_in_deck with rank 'Queen' and suit 'Hearts'. No deck parameter is provided, so it's okay. Let me structure the function call correctly."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York, for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The preferences are optional but can include pet_friendly.\n\nThe user specified \"pet friendly\", so I should include that in the preferences array. The location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is \"single\", duration is 3 nights. The start_date is March 10th, 2023. I need to format the date correctly, probably as \"2023-03-10\" in string. \n\nWait, the parameters for the function: location is a string, room_type is a string, duration is integer, start_date is a string, and preferences is an array of strings from the enum. Since the user mentioned pet_friendly, that's one of the allowed options. So the preferences array should include \"pet_friendly\". \n\nI should make sure all required parameters are present. Location is covered, room_type is single, duration is 3, start_date is 2023-03-10. The preferences are optional, but since the user specified pet-friendly, adding that makes sense. \n\nSo the function call should include all required parameters and the preferences. Let me structure that in the correct XML format."}
