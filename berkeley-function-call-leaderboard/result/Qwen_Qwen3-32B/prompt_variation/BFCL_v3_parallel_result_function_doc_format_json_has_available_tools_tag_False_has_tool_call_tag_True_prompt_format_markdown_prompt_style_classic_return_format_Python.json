The movies are Tenet and No Time To Die, which are both in the enum list. The times are 5 pm and 7:30 pm. Wait, the time parameter is an array of strings. So I need to structure the parameters correctly.\n\nBut the user is asking for two different movies at different times. However, the function's parameters have 'movie' as an array and 'time' as an array. But how do they correspond? Are the times for each movie? The description says \"Show time for each movie,\" so maybe each time corresponds to each movie in the array. So if there are two movies, there should be two times. But the user provided two movies and two times, which matches. So I can pass the movies as an array [Tenet, No Time To Die] and times as [5 pm, 7:30 pm]. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters require that the arrays are in the same order? Like the first movie's time is the first time in the array? That makes sense. So the user's request fits the parameters.

From the description, it calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of squares. For 2D points (x,y), it's sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).

All the given coordinates are integers, so that's fine. \n\nTherefore, the user's request can be fulfilled with three separate calls to math.hypot for each point.

Let me check the available functions. There's the algebra.quadratic_roots function which takes a, b, c as parameters. The first equation is 3x\u00b2 +7x +2 =0, so a=3, b=7, c=2. The second one is 5x\u00b2 -4x +1=0, so a=5, b=-4, c=1. Both equations have integer coefficients, which matches the function's parameter requirements. I need to call the function twice with these parameters. Let me make sure all required parameters are provided. Yes, a, b, c are all there for both equations. So I'll generate two tool calls."}

The user wants to find public libraries in three different cities with specific facilities. First, New York, NY needs libraries with Reading Room and Fiction. Then Los Angeles, CA with Wi-Fi and Children Section. Finally, Chicago, IL with Cafe and Reading Room.\n\nI need to check the available function. The function public_library.find_nearby requires location and facilities. The parameters are location (string) and facilities (array of specific enums). \n\nFor each city, I should call the function with the respective location and facilities. The facilities must be from the enum list. Let me verify each requested facility: Reading Room, Fiction, Wi-Fi, Children Section, Cafe are all in the enum. So each city's request is valid.\n\nFirst call: New York, NY with ['Reading Room', 'Fiction']. Second: Los Angeles, CA with ['Wi-Fi', 'Children Section']. Third: Chicago, IL with ['Cafe', 'Reading Room']. All parameters are present and correct. No missing parameters here. So three separate function calls are needed."}
