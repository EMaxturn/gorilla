The parameters required are location, category (optional with a default of General), and language (optional with a default of en). \n\nFor Paris, France, the location is specified as \"Paris, France\". Since the user didn't mention a category, the default 'General' will be used. The language is English, which is the default, so no need to specify that unless needed. \n\nFor Letterkenny, Ireland, the location is \"Letterkenny, Ireland\". The user wants technology news, so the category should be set to 'Technology'. The language is again English, which is the default. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls. Each call will use get_news_report with the respective parameters. The first call for Paris with location \"Paris, France\", category General, and language en. The second call for Letterkenny with location \"Letterkenny, Ireland\", category Technology, and language en. \n\nWait, the function's location parameter requires the state abbreviation if it's in the US, but for countries like France and Ireland, it's okay to use the country name.

The user wants me to perform several tasks on a Git repository. First, I need to clone the repo from the given URL. The function for that is clone_repo. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination isn't specified, so I'll use the default, which is the current working directory. So the first function call should be clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL.\n\nNext, after cloning, I need to analyze the repo contents to determine the primary programming language. The function analyse_repo_contents requires the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the default destination). So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce I have the analysis, I need to create or update the Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file needs the directory_name. Again, that's 'nodejs-welcome'. But wait, the analysis might tell me if there's an existing Dockerfile. However, the function's description says it generates a Dockerfile, so maybe it handles updating as well. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAML files. The function create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. The parameters for that function include deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use defaults. Deployment name might default to the directory name, image_name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type ClusterIP. So the function call would be create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', and the other parameters using their defaults.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to add all changes to Git. But the functions available don't have an 'add' function. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function says it automatically git adds all changes. So maybe after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, I can call push_git_changes_to_github. The parameters needed are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The directory is 'nodejs-welcome', commit message defaults to 'Update changes', branch to 'main', force_push false. So that's the next function call.\n\nWait, but the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\" before committing. However, the push function automatically adds changes. So maybe the push function handles that step. So the steps would be: clone, analyse, create Dockerfile, create k8s YAMLs, then push, which includes adding and committing.\n\nI need to make sure all the functions are called in order. Let me check each step again. The user's steps are: clone, analyse and create Dockerfile and k8s YAMLs, add changes, commit/push. But the push function does add and commit. So the sequence is:\n\n1. clone_repo\n2. analyse_repo_contents\n3. create_a_docker_file\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n5. push_git_changes_to_github\n\nBut the analyse step might not be necessary for creating the Dockerfile and k8s files, but the user's instruction says to base them on the analysis. However, the functions for creating Dockerfile and k8s YAMLs don't take the analysis result as a parameter. So maybe the analysis is just to determine the language, but the Dockerfile and k8s files are created regardless. The user might have intended that the Dockerfile is created based on the repo's contents, which the function does by generating it. So proceed with those function calls.\n\nNow, check parameters for each function. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. Destination is default. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is same. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same. For push, directory_name is same, commit message default, branch default, force_push default.\n\nSo the function calls in order would be:\n\nclone_repo with repo_url git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n\nanalyse_repo_contents with directory_name nodejs-welcome\n\ncreate_a_docker_file with directory_name nodejs-welcome\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name nodejs-welcome (and other defaults)\n\npush_git_changes_to_github with directory_name nodejs-welcome, commit_message default, etc.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following.\" So maybe the analysis is needed before creating the Dockerfile and k8s files. However, the functions don't link the analysis result to the creation steps. So the analysis might just be a separate step, but the creation functions are called regardless. The user might want the analysis done first, then the creation. So the order is correct.\n\nSo the final answer should list all these function calls in order."}

First, they mentioned a compilation error in their Java project involving the class 'StringNumberHandler' extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. Also, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The function 'get_relevant_classes' is designed for this. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified 'CellResult' as the search term and wants to include subdirectories. So, I'll set 'search_string' to 'CellResult', 'case_sensitive' to false (default), and 'include_subdirectories' to true.\n\nNext, the user needs the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. However, this function requires 'class_name' and 'method_name'. Since there are two methods to check, I'll need to call 'get_signature' twice: once for each method. The parameters for each call would be 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. Also, the 'include_private' parameter defaults to false, which is acceptable here unless the methods are private, but the user is overriding them, so they should be public or protected.\n\nWait, the user is working in Java, but the functions provided are for Python 3 syntax. However, the functions like 'get_signature' might still work for Java if the underlying implementation supports it. The 'language' parameter isn't part of these functions, but the user's question mentions Java. However, the available functions don't have a language parameter. The 'get_imports' function does, but the others don't. So, assuming that the functions can handle Java classes and methods regardless of the syntax, proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is to first call 'get_relevant_classes' with 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then, call 'get_signature' for each of the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. That should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The function get_area_of_square requires a 'size' parameter, which is a float. The user provided 5 cm, so the size is 5.0. That's straightforward. I'll call that function with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a location in the format 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. Queenstown is a town in Singapore, so the location should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll use the default, which is Fahrenheit. But maybe the user expects Celsius? Well, the default is Fahrenheit, but since Singapore uses Celsius, maybe I should specify that. Wait, the function's parameters have a default of Fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify. Hmm. The function's enum allows 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. Since Singapore uses Celsius, perhaps it's better to set unit='celsius' explicitly. But the user didn't mention the unit, so maybe stick to the default. However, the user might expect Celsius. I'll check the function's default again. The default is Fahrenheit. But maybe the user wants Celsius. But since the question didn't specify, maybe I should use the default. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the local unit. This is a bit ambiguous. But according to the function's parameters, the default is Fahrenheit. So I'll proceed with that unless told otherwise. So the location is 'Queenstown, Singapore' and unit is 'fahrenheit' by default. Wait, but Singapore uses Celsius. Maybe the user expects Celsius. However, the function's default is Fahrenheit. Should I override it? The user didn't specify, so perhaps it's better to use the default. But maybe the user expects Celsius. Hmm. Well, the function allows specifying the unit. Since the user didn't specify, but the location is Singapore, which uses Celsius, maybe I should set unit='celsius' to be more accurate. But the function's default is Fahrenheit. The user might not know the default. To be safe, perhaps include the unit as 'celsius' explicitly. That way, the result is in the appropriate unit for Singapore. So I'll set unit='celsius' for the weather function call.\n\nSo the two function calls are: get_area_of_square with size 5.0 and get_current_weather with location 'Queenstown, Singapore' and unit 'celsius'."}
