User provided 5 years.\n\n- contribution: type integer, required false. User didn't specify any, so I can omit it, and it will default to 0.\n\nAll required parameters are present in the user's query.\n\nI need to format my response as a function call in the specified way: inside <TOOLCALL> tags, with JSON array of objects.\n\nThe format should be:\n\n<ToolCALL>\n\n```\n\n[{\n\n\"function\": \"function_name\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\n...\n\n}\n\n}]\n\n```\n\n</ToolCALL>\n\nSo, for this, I'll call \"finance.calculate_future_value\" with the appropriate parameters.\n\nParameters to use:\n\n- initial_investment: 20000\n\n- rate_of_return: 8.0 (since it's a float)\n\n- years: 5\n\nI don't need to include contribution since it's not provided and is optional.\n\nThis seems to be all that's needed for this query.\n\nOnce I make this function call, the system will handle it, and if there's more, I can respond in subsequent turns, but for now, this fulfills the request.\n\nResponse should only contain the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else."}

Not relevant here.\n\n2. musical_scale: This is about music theory. Completely unrelated.\n\n3. calculate_paint_needed: This is exactly for calculating paint needed.

Not relevant at all.\n\n2. **find_exhibition**: This is for locating popular exhibitions based on criteria like location, time, art form, and user ratings. This seems relevant.\n\n   - Parameters: location (required), art_form (required), month (optional), user_ratings (optional).\n\n3. **get_sculpture_info**: This retrieves info about a specific artist's recent artwork. It's not about exhibitions or finding multiple ones; it's about a single sculpture by an artist. Not a good fit.\n\nSo, the best match is **find_exhibition**.\n\nNow, let's map the user's query to the parameters:\n\n- Location: \"New York\" \u2013 This matches the \"location\" parameter. I should use \"New York, NY\" as per the description example.\n\n- Art form: \"modern sculpture\" \u2013 The parameter is \"art_form\", and the example is \"sculpture\". I can use \"modern sculpture\" here, assuming it's acceptable.\n\n- Month: \"in the upcoming month\" \u2013 The \"month\" parameter is optional and says \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" If I don't specify it, it defaults to upcoming events, which might work. But to be precise, I could specify the current month or the next one. The query says \"upcoming month\", so letting it default might be fine.\n\n- User ratings: \"top rated\" \u2013 The \"user_ratings\" parameter is optional and defaults to 'high'. This could correspond to \"top rated\", so I can set it to 'high' or leave it to default.\n\nThe function description: \"Locate the most popular exhibitions based on criteria... and user ratings.\" And user_ratings defaults to 'high', which likely means top rated.\n\nSo, for **find_exhibition**, I need to provide:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\"\n\n- art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will default to upcoming events.\n\n- user_ratings: Not specified, but defaults to 'high', which aligns with \"top rated\".\n\nI think that's perfect. I can call this function with the required parameters.\n\nRequired parameters: location and art_form are required, which I have.\n\nSo, my function call should be:\n\n- function: \"find_exhibition\"\n\n- parameters: {\n\n  \"location\": \"New York, NY\",\n\n  \"art_form\": \"modern sculpture\"\n\n  }\n\nI don't need to specify month or user_ratings if they default to what we want.\n\nFinally, I need to format my response exactly as specified: Only the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array.\n\nResponse format:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```\n\n[{\n\n  \"function\": \"find_exhibition\",\n\n  \"parameters\": {\n\n    \"location\": \"New York, NY\",\n\n    \"art_form\": \"modern sculpture\"\n\n  }\n\n}]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat should be it. I'm not missing anything; this seems to directly address the user's request."}
