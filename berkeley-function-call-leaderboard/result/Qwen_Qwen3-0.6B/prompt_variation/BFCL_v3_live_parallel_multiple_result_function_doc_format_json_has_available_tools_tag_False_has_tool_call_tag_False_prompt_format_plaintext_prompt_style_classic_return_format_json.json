There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for changing drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I'll set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The newIngredients should be \"Caesar salad\" and the specialInstructions might be \"without anchovies\". \n\nThen, for the drink order 123, the user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id, new_preferences, and special_instructions. The drink_id is 123. The preferences include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", and milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions can be left empty since they didn't mention any additional info.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The foodItem is a string, and the drink_id is a string. The parameters for the drink should be a dictionary with the specified keys. \n\nDouble-checking the required parameters for each function: ChaFod requires foodItem, and the drink_id is required for ChaDri.change_drink.

So I can't call this function twice. \n\nThe second function is review_of_interviewer, which needs an interviewer's name.

Also, the parameters required for each function are different, so each call needs to be tailored to the specific skill they want.

First, they want to clone a Git repository from GitHub. The command given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url, which is provided, and the destination is the current working directory by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to that GitHub URL.\n\nNext, the user needs to analyse the repo's contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name as a parameter. The repo is in a directory, so I should use the directory name as the parameter. But wait, the user hasn't specified the exact directory path. However, the initial clone might have created it, so maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's path. I'll assume that the directory is already set, so I can call analyse_repo_contents with the directory_name as the repo's path.\n\nAfter that, they need to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files. The create_a_docker_file function requires directory_name. Since the repo is already cloned, the directory_name would be the same as the repo's path. Similarly, create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name. So I'll call both functions with the same directory_name.\n\nThen, the user wants to add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, which is the same as before. The commit message and branch name can be left as defaults unless specified. Finally, the user needs to commit and push the changes. The parameters for push_git_changes_to_github include directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, I'll use the defaults.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push function automatically adds them. So maybe the commit message and branch name are optional. But the user might want to specify them. However, the problem says to use the steps provided. So I'll proceed with the defaults.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n3. create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and defaults.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters. clone_repo requires repo_url, destination is default, recursive and depth are optional. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is required. The Docker and Kubernetes functions also require directory_name. The push function needs directory_name, commit message, branch name, and force_push. Since the user hasn't provided those, I'll use the defaults.\n\nSo the final function calls should be:\n\n[\n  {\"function\": \"clone_repo\", \"parameters\": {\"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}}\n]\n\nWait, but the push function's parameters include commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't specified these, so using defaults. The commit message defaults to \"Update changes\", branch to \"main\", and force_push to false. So that's correct."}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The functions provided are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe user wants to find classes related to 'CellResult'. The get_relevant_classes function seems relevant here. The parameters required are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search_string should be 'CellResult'. The case sensitivity is default false, so maybe it's okay. Including subdirectories is optional, but the user mentioned including them, so I'll set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. For 'setCellValue', the method is 'setCellValue', so class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue'. For 'getCellValue', the method is 'getCellValue', so same parameters. The include_private is optional, but since the user is overriding, maybe include_private is true. Wait, the default is false, so maybe set it to true to include private methods. \n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search 'CellResult', include subdirectories, and get_signature for both methods in AbstractCellHandler. Also, check if the get_imports function is needed, but the user's error is about method signatures, so maybe not. The user's error is about the method not existing, so the get_relevant_classes and get_signature should cover that."}

The user specified Queenstown Singapore, so I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it as default (fahrenheit).
