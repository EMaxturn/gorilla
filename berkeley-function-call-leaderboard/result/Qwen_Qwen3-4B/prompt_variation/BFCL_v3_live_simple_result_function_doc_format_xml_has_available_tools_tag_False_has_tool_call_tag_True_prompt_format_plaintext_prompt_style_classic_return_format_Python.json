The parameters required are the URL and a params dictionary.\n\nThe URL needs to be constructed with the base path. The example given in the function description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

The user mentioned node ID 12 in pod 10. The parameters likely need to include 'pod' and 'nodeId' as keys. So the params should be {'pod': '10', 'nodeId': '12'}.\n\nWait, but the function's params are a dictionary. I need to make sure that the keys are correct. The problem is, the function's parameters for the GET request might expect specific query parameters. Since the user is asking for Ethernet interface stats, maybe the API expects parameters like 'interfaceType' or 'ethernet' but the question doesn't specify. However, the user's query doesn't mention specific interface types, just Ethernet. But the function's parameters are not detailed beyond the example. The example URL in the function's description doesn't include query parameters, but the params parameter is required. So perhaps the params are for filtering, like pod and node ID.\n\nSo, the params should include 'pod' as 10 and 'nodeId' as 12. The function's params are a dict, so that's correct. Therefore, the function call would be requests.get with the constructed URL and the params dictionary as {'pod': '10', 'nodeId': '12'}.\n\nI need to check if all required parameters are present.

Maybe the function is part of a larger system where getting the service ID allows finding providers.

The function is called with these parameters to retrieve the service ID, which might then be used to find the housekeeper. But the user's question is to find a housekeeper, so maybe the function is part of the process. However, the function's description says it retrieves the service's unique ID, not the providers. \n\nBut given the available functions, the only possible call is to get_service_id with the specified parameters. The user might need to use this function to get the service ID, and then perhaps another step (not available here) to find the provider.

The user provided all three: JFK as the location, 16th March 2024 as the date, and 14:00 as the time. \n\nWait, the date format needs to be dd/mm/yyyy.
