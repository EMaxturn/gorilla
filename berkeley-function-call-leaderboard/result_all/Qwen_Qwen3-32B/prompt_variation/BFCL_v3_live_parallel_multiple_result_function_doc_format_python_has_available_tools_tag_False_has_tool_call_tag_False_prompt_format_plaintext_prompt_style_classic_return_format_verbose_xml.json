There's get_news_report which takes location, category, and language. The location needs to be in 'City, State' format, but since Ireland and France are countries, it should be 'City, Country'. The examples given in the function include 'Paris, France' and 'San Francisco, CA', so that's correct.\n\nFor Paris, France, the user wants general news in English. So the parameters would be location='Paris, France', category='General' (default), language='en' (default). But since the user specified English, maybe it's better to explicitly set language='en' even though it's the default. But the default is already 'en', so maybe it's optional. However, the user did mention \"in English\", so including it makes sense.\n\nFor Letterkenny, Ireland, the category is technology. So location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en'. The function allows category to be specified, so that's straightforward.\n\nI need to make two separate function calls.

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is the right choice here. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so I'll use that. The destination is not specified, so I'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters unless specified, so I'll omit them.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The function analyse_repo_contents takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the destination was default). Wait, the clone_repo's destination is defaulting to '.', so the directory name after cloning would be the repo name without the .git, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. So I'll use that as the directory_name parameter for analyse_repo_contents.\n\nOnce the analysis is done, I need to create/update the Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file requires the directory_name. Again, it's 'nodejs-welcome'. Since the analysis might indicate that Node.js is the primary language, the Dockerfile should be tailored for Node.js, but the function doesn't require any other parameters, so just the directory name is enough.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAML files. The function create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type can be left as defaults unless specified. The user didn't provide specific values, so I'll use the defaults. The image_name is set to 'latest' by default, which might not be ideal, but since the user didn't specify, it's acceptable. The deployment name could be the same as the directory, but the function allows defaults. \n\nAfter creating the files, the user wants to add all changes to git. However, the functions provided don't include a 'git add' step. The push_git_changes_to_github function automatically adds all changes, so I can use that. The directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message can be the default 'Update changes', branch_name 'main' as default, and force_push false unless specified. \n\nWait, the user step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", but the push function's description says it automatically git adds all changes. So maybe I don't need a separate step for adding. The push function will handle that. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push with commit.\n\nI need to make sure all functions are called in order. Let me check the parameters again. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, the image_name is default 'latest', but maybe the user expects a specific image name based on the repo. However, the user didn't specify, so default is okay. The deployment_name is required, but the function says to use defaults if not provided. Wait, the function's args for deployment_name say \"use Defaults if not provided.\" So maybe the default is the directory name. The function's parameters for deployment_name is a required arg, but the default is not specified in the parameters. Wait, looking back: the function's args for create_kubernetes_yaml_file have deployment_name as a required parameter with a note to use defaults if not provided. That's a bit confusing. The function's default for deployment_name isn't specified in the parameters, but the description says to use defaults if not provided. So perhaps the function can handle it without the parameter. But in the function definition, the parameters are listed as directory_name (required), deployment_name (required?), but the description says to use defaults if not provided. Maybe the function allows deployment_name to be optional, defaulting to the directory name. So I can omit deployment_name, and it will use the directory name. Similarly, image_name is default 'latest', which is acceptable here.\n\nPutting it all together, the function calls should be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination default.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and other defaults.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, default commit message, branch, and force_push.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called in order. The analysis might influence the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, but the functions don't take the analysis result as a parameter. So the functions are called sequentially, assuming the analysis is done before creating the files. The functions are designed to handle the creation based on the directory, so the analysis step is just to determine the language, but the subsequent functions don't require that info. Maybe the analysis is just for the user's info, but the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files are created regardless. So the steps are as outlined."}

I'll set the resolution to default (1280x720), color mode RGB, and image quality 80 unless specified otherwise. Wait, the user didn't mention resolution or quality, so using defaults makes sense. But the prompt needs to be detailed to capture the image requirements accurately.\n\nI need to make sure both functions are called correctly. The first function call for the search and the second for the image generation. Parameters are set as per user instructions. No missing parameters here.

They're working on a Java project and encountering a compilation error related to the 'StringNumberHandler' class extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The specific issue is that the method 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are the search string, case sensitivity, and whether to include subdirectories. Since they mentioned including subdirectories, I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and case sensitivity is probably not an issue here, so default to False.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to check their overrides. The 'get_signature' function is the right choice here. I'll need to call it twice, once for each method. The class name is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method names are provided. Since the user didn't mention private methods, 'include_private' can stay as default False.\n\nI should make sure all required parameters are included.

I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the first function call is get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True. Then two calls to get_signature for each method in AbstractCellHandler. That should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The get_class_info function can retrieve info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. So I should call that with class_name set to 'Weather'. The include_private parameter is optional, defaulting to False, which is fine unless the user wants private methods, which they didn't mention.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. The parameters required are a and b, both non-negative integers. Since 36 and 48 are both non-negative, I can use this function. The larger number is 48, but the function's parameters don't specify that a has to be larger than b, but the description mentions a is the first and larger integer. Wait, the function's Args say a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So maybe I should pass 48 as a and 36 as b? Or does it matter? Well, GCD is commutative, so the order shouldn't affect the result. But to follow the function's specifications, maybe a should be the larger one. Let me check the function's Args again. The first argument a is described as the first and larger non-negative integer. So I should pass 48 as a and 36 as b. But actually, mathematically, GCD(36,48) is the same as GCD(48,36). So maybe the function is designed to take any order. Hmm, but the function's parameter a is specified as the larger one. To be safe, I'll pass a=48 and b=36. But the user's question says \"for 36 and 48\", so maybe the order is as given. Wait, the function's first parameter is a, which is the first and larger. So if the user lists 36 first, but 48 is larger, maybe the function expects a to be the larger. But the user might not know that, so perhaps the function is designed to handle any order. Let me think. The GCD function in math libraries typically doesn't care about the order. For example, math.gcd(36,48) in Python returns 12, same as math.gcd(48,36). So the function's parameters might not require a to be larger. But the description here says a is the first and larger. Maybe it's a mistake in the description. To be safe, I'll pass a=36 and b=48, even though a is smaller. Wait, but the description says a is the first and larger. The user's input is 36 and 48. So if the user passes a=36 and b=48, but the function expects a to be larger, maybe the function will swap them internally. Or maybe the description is incorrect. Since the function's actual implementation might not care, but according to the given function definition, I should follow the Args as described. The Args for math_gcd are a (int): first and larger non-negative integer. So the user's input is 36 and 48. The first is 36, but the larger is 48. So perhaps the function expects a to be the first argument given, regardless of size. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger. So if the user provides 36 as the first argument, but it's smaller than b (48), does that matter? The function might still compute the GCD correctly. But the description says a is the larger. Maybe it's a requirement. If the function is implemented with Euclidean algorithm, the order doesn't matter. But according to the function's Args, a is supposed to be the larger. So to comply with the function's specifications, I should pass a=48 and b=36. But the user's question lists 36 and 48. Hmm. Maybe the function's description is a bit misleading. Let me proceed by passing a=36 and b=48, since the user's question lists them in that order, and the function's parameters might not strictly require a to be larger. The result will be the same either way.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: determining how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x=5. Steepness refers to the derivative of the function at that point. The derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x, so at x=5, the derivative is 10. But the user might want a numerical approximation using the estimate_derivative function. The function requires the mathematical function as a callable, the point x, and optionally dx and method. The function f(x) = x\u00b2 can be represented as a lambda function. The point x is 5. The default dx is 0.0001 and method is 'central'. So I need to call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. The dx and method can be omitted since they have defaults. \n\nSo the two function calls needed are math_gcd with a=36 and b=48, and estimate_derivative with the function, x=5. \n\nWait, but the user's first part is to find the HCF (which is GCD) of 36 and 48, then the second part is about the steepness of x\u00b2 at x=5. So the first function call is math_gcd(a=36, b=48) or a=48, b=36? Let me check again. The function's Args for math_gcd: a is the first and larger non-negative integer. The user's input is 36 and 48. So if the first argument is a, which is supposed to be the larger, then a should be 48 and b 36. But the user's question lists 36 first. However, the function's parameter a is supposed to be the larger. So to comply with the function's Args, I should pass a=48 and b=36. But the user's question says \"for 36 and 48\", which might imply the order. However, the function's description says a is the larger. So perhaps the correct way is to pass a=48 and b=36. But since the GCD is the same regardless of order, maybe the function is designed to handle that. Let me proceed with a=36 and b=48, as the user listed them, even if the function's description says a is the larger. Maybe the description is just a note, and the actual function can handle any order. \n\nIn conclusion, the two function calls needed are:\n\n1. math_gcd with a=36 and b=48.\n2. estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5.\n\nSo the final answer should be two function calls."}

The user wants two things: first, calculate the GCD of 36 and 48, and then estimate the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5.\n\nStarting with the GCD. The math_gcd function requires two positive integers. The user provided 36 and 48, which are both positive integers. So that's straightforward. I'll call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. Wait, the function's parameters say a is the first and larger integer. Oh right, the Euclidean algorithm typically takes the larger number first. So even if the user lists 36 first, the function expects a as the larger one. So I should set a=48 and b=36 to ensure the larger number is first. That should work.\n\nNext, the derivative estimation. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2. The estimate_derivative function needs a callable function, the x-value, and optionally dx and method. The user didn't specify dx or method, so I'll use the defaults: dx=0.001 and method='central'. To represent f(x) = x\u00b2, I can use a lambda function like lambda x: x**2. The x-value is 5. So the parameters for estimate_derivative would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5, dx=0.001, method='central'. Since dx and method have defaults, I can omit them in the function call if the user didn't specify, but the function's parameters include them with defaults. Wait, the user's instruction says to use the default values if not provided. So in the function call, I should include the parameters as per the function's definition. But in the actual code, if the user didn't specify, we can leave them out. However, in the function call representation here, do I need to include the default parameters? The problem says to make the function calls based on the user's question. Since the user didn't mention dx or method, I should only include the required parameters. The function's required parameters are 'function' and 'x'. So the call would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. The dx and method can be omitted, relying on defaults.\n\nSo putting it all together, first call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, then estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2 and x=5. The order is important here as per the user's request. The system will handle the sequence of function calls."}

The 'getCurrentTime' function can handle that. The timezone parameter should be 'Europe/Berlin', and include_date needs to be True.

Keep_original is also a boolean with a default. So I should call rotateImageAction with degrees=20.\n\nNext, the \"flip it horizontally\" part. The flipImageAction function is for flipping.

Like, should I rotate first then flip, or the other way around? The user's instruction is to turn (rotate) first and then flip. The functions are applied in the order they are called.

So the function calls should be first rotateImageAction with 20 degrees, then flipImageAction with horizontal. \n\nI need to make sure there are no missing parameters.

The date is in YYYY-MM-DD format, cities are in \"City, State\" format, and the category is set to direct. Both functions are necessary to address the user's two main requests. No other functions seem relevant here, like flights or hotels, since the user didn't mention those. I'll proceed with these two function calls."}

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so the city is set. They didn't mention unisex, so I'll default is_unisex to 'dontcare'.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is needed. The parameters are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' as the salon name, 15:00 as time, and 2023-05-10 as date. All required parameters are present.\n\nI need to make sure the date formats are correct. The city format for FindProvider is 'City, State (abbr)', which Sunnyvale, CA fits. The appointment date is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The time is in 24-hour format. Everything checks out. So I'll call both functions in order."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThere's a function called get_current_weather. Its parameters are location (string in 'City, State' format) and unit (default 'fahrenheit'). The user specified both locations and wants Fahrenheit, which is the default. So I need to call this function twice, once for each city.\n\nFirst call: location 'Boston, MA', unit 'fahrenheit'. Second call: location 'San Francisco, CA', since the user mentioned San Francisco but the state abbreviation isn't given. I'll assume CA as the state abbreviation for San Francisco. The unit is already default, so maybe it's optional, but the user explicitly said 'fahr', so including it makes sense.\n\nWait, the function's unit parameter has a default of 'fahrenheit', so even if not specified, it would use Fahrenheit. But the user specified 'fahr', so maybe include it to be explicit. Let me structure the function calls accordingly.\n\nCheck if the parameters are correct. The location for Boston is correct as 'Boston, MA'. San Francisco is in California, so 'San Francisco, CA'. The unit is 'fahrenheit' as per the user's request.

The user wants all pending and active mandates for users Parath and Bhanu. Hmm, the functions available are user.mandates and partner.mandates. \n\nFirst, the user.mandates function takes a name and status. The partner.mandates function is for the partner's own mandates. Since the user is asking about specific users (Parath and Bhanu), I should use user.mandates for each of them.\n\nThe status needs to be either 'pending' or 'active'. But the user wants both. Wait, the function's status parameter defaults to 'active'. So to get both, maybe I need to call the function twice for each user once with 'pending' and once with 'active'? Or does the API allow multiple statuses in one call? The function's parameters don't mention an array for status, so probably not. So I need to make separate calls for each status.\n\nWait, the user wants all pending and active mandates. So for each user (Parath and Bhanu), I need to call user.mandates twice: once with status 'pending' and once with 'active'. That would cover both statuses. Let me check the parameters again. The user.mandates function's status is a string, defaulting to 'active'. So each call can only fetch one status at a time. Therefore, four function calls in total: two users times two statuses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the API allows a different approach, but based on the given functions, I can't combine the statuses. So the correct approach is to call user.mandates for each user and each status. So the function calls would be:\n\nFor Parath:\n- user.mandates with name 'parath' and status 'pending'\n- user.mandates with name 'parath' and status 'active'\n\nFor Bhanu:\n- user.mandates with name 'bhanu' and status 'pending'\n- user.mandates with name 'bhanu' and status 'active'\n\nThat should retrieve all pending and active mandates for both users. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function's requirements. The name is a string, and status is a string. The default for status is 'active', but since we need both, we have to specify both statuses explicitly."}
