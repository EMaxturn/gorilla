They specified that the results should be in text format and limited to a maximum of 10. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, the HNA_WQA.search function is for retrieving up-to-date information via web search, which fits here. The parameters needed are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user mentioned the keyword is '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format should be text, and max_results 10.

The user said \"\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\", so result_format should be 'text'. Max_results is 10.

The user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday and wants a congratulatory message sent to him. First, I need to figure out how to get Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions don't include a direct way to look up personal information like birthdays unless it's stored in the core or archival memory.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' for editing core memory, which includes the 'human' section for user details. But the user hasn't provided any information about Shishir Patil in the conversation history. So, maybe the birthday isn't in the core memory. \n\nNext, the 'recall_memory_search' function allows searching through conversation history. However, the user hasn't mentioned Shishir Patil before, so searching the recall memory might not yield results. The 'archival_memory_search' could be used if the birthday was stored there, but there's no indication that the user has provided that information.\n\nSince the user is asking for a birthday and a message, but there's no function to retrieve personal data like birthdays from external sources, I might need to inform the user that I can't find the birthday. However, the user might expect me to use the 'send_message' function to send a message. But without the birthday, I can't create a congratulatory message. \n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to generate a generic message. But the query specifically asks for a congratulatory message to Shishir Patil, implying that the birthday is known. Since the functions don't allow me to look up external data, I should check if the birthday is in the core or archival memory. If not, I can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the birthday is in the core memory under the 'human' section. But since the user hasn't provided that info, I can't assume. Therefore, I should respond that I can't find the birthday and can't send the message. But the user might want me to proceed with a generic message. However, the functions require specific parameters. \n\nWait, the 'send_message' function requires a message and recipient. If I don't have the birthday, I can't create a personalized message. So, the correct approach is to inform the user that the birthday isn't available. But the user might expect me to use the 'core_memory_search' or other functions. However, the available functions don't include a way to search for personal data. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the birthday isn't in the memory, so I can't send the message. But the user might have intended for me to use the 'core_memory' or 'archival_memory' functions. Since the user hasn't provided the birthday data, I can't proceed.

The account number is given, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and maybe the individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dict. The BankStatementOverView function might require that, but the user hasn't given individual transactions. However, the user did mention the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. Maybe the transaction_overview can be constructed with those totals. But the function's description says it's a summary of transactions within the period, including totals and counts. So perhaps the transaction_overview is a dictionary that includes those totals.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to create that summary. However, the user is asking for the BankStatementOverView, which requires the transaction_overview. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be used to generate the transaction summary, which can then be passed to BankStatementOverView.\n\nWait, looking at the functions again. The transaction_summary.generate function takes transactions array, starting and ending dates, total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, and customer info. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate isn't applicable here because it requires the list of transactions. However, the user might not have that data. Alternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView can be called with the totals as part of the transaction_overview.\n\nBut the parameters for BankStatementOverView require transaction_overview as a dict. The user provided the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with those values. However, the function's parameters might expect a more detailed summary, but given the user's input, that's the best we can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the transaction_summary.generate is used to create the transaction overview, but since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, that function might not be applicable. However, the user's question is to provide an overview of the bank statement, which includes the transaction summary. So perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the right function here, and the transaction_overview can be constructed with the totals provided by the user.\n\nSo, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n  \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n  \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n  \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n  \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut the transaction_overview is supposed to be a summary of transactions, which might include more details. However, given the user's input, this is the best we can do. The user hasn't provided individual transactions, so the transaction_summary.generate might not be necessary here. Therefore, the BankStatementOverView function is the one to call with the provided parameters."}

Maybe the function allows an empty string, but the parameters don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake. But since I have to proceed, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's say the user wants any category, so I'll use a general category like 'American' as a default. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle it without, but according to the parameters, it's required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's query is missing the category, but the function requires it. So perhaps the user needs to provide a category. But since the user didn't, maybe I should proceed with a default. Let me check the function again.

Therefore, the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as \"concert\" and then \"play,\" but since the user is asking for either, perhaps the first call with \"concert\" would suffice, and if there are no results, then \"play.\" But the user might not know that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can accept \"music\" as the event_type, which would include concerts, and \"theater\" for plays.

However, the user's question is a single query. \n\nBut according to the function's parameters, event_type is a single string.

The Music_3_LookupMusic function can search based on genre and year. But they also mentioned an album, \"Gotta Be Me\". However, the LookupMusic function parameters include artist, album, genre, and year.

Then, if there are results, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name from the lookup result. But since the user hasn't provided specific track names, maybe the lookup is needed first.\n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a song\" in that style and album. So the steps would be: look up songs in Hillbilly from 2019 on the album Gotta Be Me, then play one of them. However, the functions might need to be called in sequence. But the system might need to chain them. However, the user's message is a single request, so maybe the assistant should first call LookupMusic to find the songs, then PlayMedia to play one.

However, the PlayMedia function requires the track name. So perhaps the assistant needs to first use LookupMusic to find the track names that match the criteria, then use PlayMedia with that track. But since the user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\", maybe the lookup should include the album parameter.\n\nSo, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\", album=\"Gotta Be Me\". Then, once the songs are found, the assistant can take the track name from the result and call PlayMedia with that track, possibly specifying the album and artist if known. But the user didn't mention the artist, so maybe leave that out. However, the PlayMedia function's artist parameter is optional. So after getting the track from Lookup, play it.\n\nBut the user's message is a single request. The assistant needs to make the necessary function calls. Since the user is asking to \"hear a song\" in that style and album, the assistant should first look up the songs that match the criteria, then play one. However, the assistant can't know the track name yet, so the first step is the lookup. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. Then, once the tracks are found, the next step would be to play one of them. But since the user hasn't provided specific track names, the assistant must first perform the lookup.

The available functions are Buses_3_FindBus and Buses_3_BuyBusTicket, along with Hotels_4 related ones. Since the user is asking to find an itinerary, not purchase a ticket yet, the Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Buses_3_FindBus: from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles, and departure_date as March 10th, 2023. The date format needs to be MM/DD/YYYY, so March 10th would be 03/10/2023. The user is traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1. The category is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it out or set to default. \n\nWait, the parameters for FindBus require from_city and to_city as strings in 'City, State' format, which the user provided. The departure_date is required, so converting March 10th, 2023 to 03/10/2023. Num_passengers is 1, which is within the allowed range of 1-5. Category is optional, so if the user didn't mention it, we can omit it. \n\nSo the function call should include from_city=\"Fresno, CA\", to_city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", departure_date=\"03/10/2023\", and num_passengers=1. The category parameter isn't needed here since the user didn't specify any preferences on the bus route category. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.

But since the user didn't specify, maybe the function is called without that parameter, and the system will return the tokens as per the default. Alternatively, the assistant might need to call both functions to get all possible tokens. Wait, the get_shareable_api_tokens is for custom dashboards. The user is asking for all API tokens, so maybe the get_api_tokens is the right one. So the correct function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\". The include_expired is optional, but since the user is trying to remember all tokens, maybe set it to true. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the assistant should call it without that parameter. However, the function's include_expired is a boolean, and the user might not know if they want expired tokens. But the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, so including expired ones would be better. Therefore, the assistant should call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to true. But wait, the function's include_expired is optional, so the assistant can choose to include it. However, the user didn't mention expired tokens, so maybe it's safer to not include it. But the user might have expired tokens that they need to remember. Hmm. The function's default for include_expired is false, but the user might want all tokens. So maybe the assistant should call the function with include_expired set to true. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the assistant should call the function without that parameter. Alternatively, the assistant can call both functions. Wait, the get_shareable_api_tokens is for custom dashboards. The user is asking for all API tokens, so maybe the get_api_tokens is the right one. So the correct function call is get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\". The include_expired is optional, so the assistant can choose to include it or not. Since the user is trying to remember all tokens, including expired ones, the assistant should set include_expired to true. Therefore, the function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired true. But the user didn't mention that, but maybe that's the right approach. Alternatively, the assistant might not know, so just call the function without that parameter. But the user might need all tokens, so including expired ones. So the assistant should make the call with include_expired set to true. Therefore, the function call is get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired true."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the threshold is 5% error rate, and notifications should go to two emails.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The functions available are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application\", the create_global_application_alert_config is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (string, required), alert_type (string, required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (boolean, optional). \n\nThe user provided the name, threshold as 5%, which is a float (0.05?), but maybe they meant 5.0. The recipients are two emails. The alert_type isn't specified, but the threshold is for error rate. Maybe the alert_type should be 'error_rate'? But the user didn't mention it. Wait, the function requires alert_type. Oh, the user didn't specify the alert type, but the threshold is for error rate. Maybe I need to infer that. But the function requires alert_type, so I have to include it. However, the user didn't mention it. Wait, the question says \"for an error rate threshold of 5%\", so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate'. But the user didn't explicitly state that. Hmm, but the function requires alert_type. So I have to include it. Maybe the user expects that the alert_type is 'error_rate' based on the context. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is something else. But since the user mentioned error rate, I'll assume that's the alert type.\n\nSo parameters would be name: 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type: 'error_rate', threshold: 5.0 (as a float), recipients: ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], and enabled is optional. The user didn't mention enabling it, so maybe leave it as default (probably false). But the function has enabled as optional, so maybe it's okay to omit it. Wait, the function's parameters for create_global_application_alert_config have enabled as required=false, so it's optional. So the function call would include name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The user didn't mention enabling, so maybe the default is false. But the user might want it enabled. Wait, the question says \"set up a new global application alert configuration\", which might mean creating it but not necessarily enabling it. But maybe the user wants it enabled. However, the user didn't specify, so perhaps we should not include enabled unless specified. So the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with the given parameters, and enabled is not provided. But the function requires the parameters name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. So that's all. So the answer is to call create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked boolean. The user didn't mention anything about revoked tokens, so maybe I should default to not including them unless specified. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe include_revoked should be true? Wait, the function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Hmm, maybe that's not the right function.\n\nLooking at the other function: api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. This one also retrieves API tokens for the user. The parameters are include_expired (boolean), page (integer), and page_size (integer). The user wants all tokens, so maybe we need to fetch all pages. But the user didn't specify page or page_size. The default page_size is probably 100, but since the user wants all, maybe we need to handle pagination. However, the user might not know about pagination, so maybe the system should handle it by making multiple calls. But the current task is to make the function calls. Since the user hasn't specified page or page_size, perhaps we should use the default values. But the function requires those parameters as optional. Wait, the parameters are not required, so maybe we can call it without them, but the API might default to page 1 and a certain page size. However, the user might need all tokens, so maybe we need to set a high page_size. But the maximum is 100. So if the user has more than 100 tokens, we need to fetch multiple pages. But the user hasn't provided that info. \n\nWait, the user's main request is to get all API tokens. The function get_api_tokens might return a list, but if there are many, it might require multiple pages. However, the user hasn't specified page or page_size, so maybe the function will return the first page by default. But the user wants all, so perhaps the assistant should call the function with page=1 and page_size=100, and then check if there are more pages. But since the user is asking for all, maybe the assistant should make the call with the maximum page_size and handle pagination. However, the user hasn't provided the necessary parameters, so maybe the assistant should just call the function with the default parameters. But the user might need to know if there are more pages. However, the current task is to make the function call. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the shareable tokens, which would be the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens. But the user said \"all API tokens\", which might include both shareable and non-shareable. But the function get_shareable_api_tokens only gets shareable ones. So perhaps the correct function is get_api_tokens. \n\nSo, the user's user_id is 12345. The function get_api_tokens doesn't take user_id as a parameter. Wait, looking back at the functions: the get_api_tokens function's parameters are include_expired, page, page_size. But how does it know which user's tokens to retrieve? The function's description says \"associated with the user's account\", but the parameters don't include user_id. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the function is part of the APITokenApi, which might be authenticated, so the user is already logged in, and the function retrieves the tokens for the current user. But the user provided their user_id, which might be necessary. Wait, but the parameters for get_api_tokens don't include user_id. That's a problem. \n\nWait, looking at the function definitions again. The get_api_tokens function is part of api_token_api.APITokenApi. The parameters are include_expired, page, page_size. But how does it know which user's tokens to retrieve? Maybe the API is designed such that the user is already authenticated, so the function doesn't need the user_id. But the user provided their user_id, which might be necessary. However, the function's parameters don't include user_id. That's a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which requires user_id. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the get_api_tokens function, but since the user provided their user_id, maybe that's not part of the parameters. This is confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the user is using the APITokenApi's get_api_tokens, which is for the current user. But the user provided their user_id, which might be needed. However, the function's parameters don't include user_id. So perhaps the user's user_id is not required here. Maybe the function is designed to retrieve the tokens for the current user, which is authenticated. \n\nIn that case, the user's request is to get all API tokens, so the correct function is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The parameters are include_expired (default false), page (default 1), page_size (default 100). The user wants all tokens, so maybe set page_size to 100 and page to 1. But the user didn't specify, so the function will return the first page. However, the user might need to know if there are more pages. But the current task is to make the function call. \n\nSo the correct function call would be to use get_api_tokens with the default parameters. But the user provided their user_id, which is 12345. However, the function doesn't take user_id as a parameter. So maybe the user's user_id is not needed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the shareable tokens, which would be the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens. But the user said \"all API tokens\", which might include both shareable and non-shareable. But the function get_shareable_api_tokens only gets shareable ones. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The user's user_id is 12345, but the functions don't take that as a parameter. So perhaps the user is authenticated, and the functions are designed to retrieve the tokens for the current user. Therefore, the correct function is get_api_tokens. \n\nSo the function call would be to api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired set to true to include expired tokens, but the user didn't specify that. However, the user wants all tokens, so maybe include_expired is true. But the user didn't mention expired tokens. \n\nAlternatively, the user might not want to include expired ones. But the function's parameter is optional. So the assistant should call the function without specifying include_expired, which defaults to false. \n\nBut the user is asking for all tokens, which might include expired ones. So maybe set include_expired to true. However, the user didn't specify that. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But given the user's request, the best approach is to call the get_api_tokens function with the default parameters, which would return the first page of tokens. Since the user wants all, maybe the assistant should handle pagination, but the current task is to make the function call. \n\nSo the correct function call is to use api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The parameters are not specified, so the function is called with default values. However, the user provided their user_id, but the function doesn't take it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the shareable tokens, so the function is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens. The user's user_id is 12345, so that function is called with user_id=12345 and include_revoked set to false (since the user didn't mention revoked tokens). \n\nBut the user said \"all API tokens\", which might include both shareable and non-shareable. However, the function get_shareable_api_tokens only gets shareable ones. So maybe the user is referring to shareable tokens. \n\nBut the user's message is \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So the user is asking for all tokens, which might include both shareable and non-shareable. But the available functions don't have a function that retrieves all tokens. The get_api_tokens function might be the right one, but it doesn't take user_id. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the user is using the APITokenApi's get_api_tokens, which is for the current user. The user's user_id is 12345, but the function doesn't require it. So the assistant should call get_api_tokens with default parameters. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to use api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The parameters are not specified, so the function is called with default values. The user's user_id is 12345, but the function doesn't take it. \n\nSo the final answer is to call get_api_tokens with default parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, the functions provided are set_alarm and set_countdown. The user is asking for a reminder at a specific time, which sounds like an alarm. The set_alarm function allows specifying a time in various formats, including date and time. The parameters needed are alarm_time and purpose. \n\nThe user mentioned the date as 2023-12-1, which is in the correct YYYY-MM-DD format. The time is 7:00 AM. Since the alarm can take a 12-hour format with AM/PM, '7:00 AM' is acceptable. The purpose is to wake up for a meeting. \n\nSo, I should call set_alarm with alarm_time set to '2023-12-01 07:00:00' (including the date and time) and purpose as 'wake up'. Wait, the user said \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is a typo for tomorrow. But the date given is 2023-12-1. Assuming that's the correct date. However, if today's date is 2023-11-30, then tomorrow would be 2023-12-1. So the alarm time is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the date is 2023-12-1, which is tomorrow. So the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. The purpose is 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function allows the purpose parameter, so including that would be helpful. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up for meeting'. But the purpose is optional, so maybe just 'wake up' is sufficient. The user might not need the purpose, but including it could make the alarm more specific. However, the function's purpose parameter is optional, so it's okay to omit it if not needed. Wait, the user says \"to wake up early for a meeting\", so the purpose could be 'meeting' or 'wake up'. But the function's purpose is optional. \n\nSo the main thing is to set the alarm time correctly. The user might have a typo in the date, but the given date is 2023-12-1. So the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up for meeting' or similar. But the purpose is optional, so maybe just the time is enough. However, the user specified the purpose, so including it would be better. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time set to '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up for meeting'."}
