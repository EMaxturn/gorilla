Since we are only checking one region and one platform, the price we get will be the only one.\n However, it is possible that the same game might have different editions (like standard, deluxe) and hence different prices. But the function does not specify edition.\n Given the function's description, it likely returns the price for the base game or the standard edition. If we need to compare multiple editions, we might need more functions, but they are not provided.\n\n Since the function `video_games.store_price` exists and we have the required parameters (game_title, platform, region), we can call it.\n\n But note: the question says \"cheapest\" - if the game is on sale, then the sale price might be cheaper than the regular price.\n We should also check if the game is on sale? However, the function `video_games.store_price` should return the current selling price, which would be the sale price if it's on sale.\n\n Therefore, we can simply call `video_games.store_price` for the given parameters and that will be the current price.\n\n However, the problem is: the function `video_games.store_price` does not return multiple editions. So we are only getting one price? \n But the function's description does not specify how it handles multiple editions. Since we are not given a function that lists editions, we have to assume that `video_games.store_price` returns the standard edition price or the base game.\n\n Alternatively, it might be that the store only lists one price for the base game and then has DLCs and editions as separate products? \n But without more functions, we cannot check multiple editions.\n\n Therefore, we will assume that we are checking the standard edition.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can get the current price for the standard edition of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on PlayStation in the US.\n\n But note: the question asks for the cheapest selling price. Since we are only getting one price (for the standard edition) and we don't have a function to get other editions, we can only return that one.\n\n Alternatively, if the game is on sale, then the current selling price is the sale price. We can also check the sale status to confirm, but that doesn't give us a cheaper price beyond what `store_price` returns.\n\n So, we can simply call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n However, note that the function `video_games.on_sale` exists. We could check if it's on sale and then get the sale price? But the `store_price` function should already return the sale price if it's on sale.\n\n Therefore, we can directly use `video_games.store_price`.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"cheapest\" - what if there are multiple stores? We are only given one store per platform? The function is for the PlayStation Store. So we are only getting the price from that store.\n\n Therefore, we will call the function for the given parameters.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.store_currency` might be needed to know the currency? But the question asks for the price, and the price will be in the currency of the region. We are not asked for the currency.\n\n But the price might be in a currency that we need to convert? The question does not specify. We are only asked for the price. We can assume that the price is returned as a number and we don't need to convert.\n\n Therefore, we only need to call `video_games.store_price`.\n\n However, to be safe, we can also get the currency? The question doesn't ask for the currency, but the price without currency might be ambiguous. But the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price and likely includes the currency? Or we can get the currency by calling `video_games.store_currency`? \n\n The function `video_games.store_currency` returns the currency used in a specific region and platform. Since the user might want the currency to interpret the price, but the question does not explicitly ask for the currency. \n\n Since the question only asks for the cheapest selling price, and we are in the United States, the currency is USD. But to be generic, we can also get the currency and then return the price with currency? However, the instruction says to return the function calls. We cannot combine two calls in one response? \n\n But note: the format allows multiple function calls in one response. We can do:\n\n   [video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'), \n    video_games.store_currency(platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\n But wait: the question only asks for the price, not the currency. However, without the currency, the price number might be meaningless. But the user's question is in the context of the US, so they expect USD. \n\n However, the function `video_games.store_price` might return the price as a number without currency. We don't know the exact return format. The function `video_games.store_currency` returns the currency. So if we want to present the price with currency, we need both.\n\n Alternatively, the system that uses these functions might combine the results. But the instruction says to output the function calls.\n\n Considering the above, we can do two calls: one for the price and one for the currency. Then the system can combine them.\n\n But note: the question asks for the \"cheapest selling price\". Since we are only getting one price (for the standard edition) and in one store, we are returning that price. And the currency is for that region.\n\n Therefore, we will call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n   video_games.store_currency(platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n However, note the default for `store_currency` region is 'True'? That doesn't make sense. Looking at the docstring: `region (str, default='True')`. This is likely a mistake. We should pass the region as 'United States'.\n\n Alternatively, if we are sure that the US store uses USD, we might skip the currency? But the function exists and we are in the US, so we can get it.\n\n But the question does not ask for the currency. So if the system only requires the price, then we might not need the currency. However, the problem says: \"What is the cheapest selling price\". Without currency, the price is ambiguous.\n\n Therefore, to be safe, we will get both.\n\n Alternatively, we can assume that the `store_price` function returns a string with currency symbol? We don't know. The docstring doesn't specify.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the return format, and we are allowed to call multiple functions, we call both.\n\n However, note that the user's question is only about the price. The currency is implicit (US store -> USD). But let's do as per the available functions.\n\n Therefore, the function calls are:\n\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n   video_games.store_currency(platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But wait: the function `video_games.on_sale` might be relevant? We are getting the price, which should be the current selling price (including sale). So we don't need to check sale separately.\n\n However, if we want to know if it's on sale, we can call `on_sale` too? But the question doesn't ask for sale status.\n\n So we stick to the two calls above.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` has a default for region of 'True'. That seems odd. We are passing region='United States'. So it should be fine.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n [video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'), video_games.store_currency(platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\n However, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n We are calling two functions. This should be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what if there are multiple editions? We don't have a function to list editions. So we cannot get the price for every edition. Therefore, we are returning the price for the standard edition (as per the function's behavior).\n\n If the user meant the cheapest among all editions, we don't have the means. So we do the best we can.\n\n Therefore, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n [video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'), video_games.store_currency(platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]"}

However, we are missing the final speed (which we are trying to find) and we have distance and time.\n\n 2. kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest:\n      This function seems more appropriate because:\n        - It calculates the speed (which is what we want) of an object that starts from rest.\n        - It takes distance and time (and initial_speed which we know is 0).\n\n However, note the function signature: \n      calculate_speed_from_rest(distance, time, initial_speed=0)\n\n But wait: the function name suggests it calculates speed from rest, and the parameters are distance and time. However, in kinematics, if an object starts from rest and moves with constant acceleration, then:\n\n      distance = (initial_speed * time) + (1/2 * acceleration * time^2)\n\n      and since initial_speed is 0, we have: distance = (1/2) * acceleration * time^2.\n\n      Then, the final speed: v = u + a*t => v = a*t.\n\n      But note: the function calculate_speed_from_rest might be using a different formula? The docstring doesn't specify the formula.\n\n Alternatively, we might not have a function that directly returns the final speed? \n\n Let me reexamine:\n\n  The function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest has parameters: distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). It returns the speed. \n\n  However, note that the standard formula for an object starting from rest (u=0) under constant acceleration is:\n\n      v = u + a*t = a*t   ... (1)\n      s = (u+v)/2 * t   => s = (0+v)/2 * t = (v*t)/2  => v = (2*s)/t   ... (2)\n\n  So we can get the final speed without knowing acceleration by equation (2).\n\n  Therefore, we can use:\n\n      kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0)\n\n  But note: the function might be using that exact formula? \n\n  However, the function name and parameters match our requirement.\n\n  Alternatively, if we were to use the first function (calculate_acceleration) we would need to compute acceleration first and then compute the speed? But that would require two steps and we are only allowed to output one function call per turn? Actually, the instruction says we can output one or more function calls until we complete the task. But note: we are to output the function calls in the format [func1(...), func2(...)] if we need to chain.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"find out how fast an object was going\", meaning the final speed.\n\n  Since we have a function that directly returns the speed given distance and time (and initial_speed=0), we can use:\n\n      kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)\n\n  because initial_speed defaults to 0.\n\n  Therefore, we call:\n\n      [kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)]\n\n  But note: the function requires distance and time as integers? The docstring says they are integers. We have integers (20 and 4). So it's okay.\n\n  However, what if the function internally uses a formula that requires acceleration? Then we might need to break it down? But the function is designed for exactly this scenario.\n\n  Let me check the function description again: \"Calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest under a constant acceleration over a specified distance.\" So it should be using the formula that relates distance and time for constant acceleration starting from rest.\n\n  Therefore, we use that function.\n\n  Alternatively, if we didn't have that function, we might have to calculate acceleration first and then the final speed. But we do have it.\n\n  So the answer is to call:\n\n      kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(20, 4)\n\n  But note: the parameters are named. We can use named parameters for clarity.\n\n  Since the function expects:\n      distance (int)\n      time (int)\n      initial_speed (int, default=0)\n\n  We can write:\n\n      kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)\n\n  We don't need to specify initial_speed because it defaults to 0.\n\n  However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have all the required parameters.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      [kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)]\n\n  But note: the function name is exactly as given? Yes: \"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\"\n\n  Also, the parameters are named: distance and time.\n\n  We are not missing any required parameters.\n\n  Let me double-check: the function does not require acceleration? No, because it is designed to compute the speed from distance and time (and initial_speed=0).\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  However, what if the function uses a different formula? That is not our concern because the function is provided and we assume it does the correct calculation.\n\n  Therefore, the function call is:\n\n      [kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)]\n\n  But note: the function expects integers? We are passing integers.\n\n  Alternatively, if we were to use the acceleration function, we would do:\n\n      Step 1: Find acceleration using kinematics.calculate_acceleration? But note: we don't have final_speed (which we are trying to find). We have initial_speed (0), time (4), and distance (20). The function calculate_acceleration has an argument for distance? Yes, it has a parameter 'distance' (with default 0). So we can use:\n\n          acceleration = kinematics.calculate_acceleration(initial_speed=0, final_speed=?, time=4, distance=20)\n\n      But we don't know final_speed. So we cannot use that function because we are missing final_speed.\n\n      Alternatively, the function might be able to compute acceleration without final_speed? The function signature has both initial_speed and final_speed. So we must provide both? The function description doesn't specify which combinations are allowed. But typically, acceleration can be calculated by:\n\n          a = (v - u) / t   ... if we have u, v, and t.\n\n      Or by:\n\n          s = u*t + (1/2)*a*t^2   => a = 2*(s - u*t) / t^2\n\n      So if we don't have v, we can use the second formula. But the function calculate_acceleration might require either both speeds and time OR the other set? The docstring doesn't specify. \n\n      Since the function has a parameter for distance (with default 0) and we are providing it, it might use the second formula. But we don't know. And the function also requires final_speed? The function signature has:\n\n          initial_speed, final_speed, time, distance (default=0)\n\n      So we must provide final_speed? But we don't have it. Therefore, we cannot use this function for this particular problem because we are missing the final_speed.\n\n      Hence, the only option is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\n  Therefore, we call:\n\n      [kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)]"}

It takes two arguments: `room` and `period`.\n - The `room` should be specified. In this case, the room is \"living room\".\n - The `period` is set to default 'Daily', but the question says \"currently\", so we can use the default or specify a period that implies current (like 'Daily' or 'Weekly'). Since the function defaults to 'Daily', we can omit it or set it to 'Daily'. However, to be explicit, we can set period='Daily' or perhaps 'Current'. But the function only accepts the period as described, and the default is 'Daily'. Since the question says \"currently\", we can use the default.\n\n However, note: the function description says the period is a string and the default is 'Daily'. We are not required to specify the default, but we can. Since the user wants the current popularity, we can use the default by not including the period, but the problem says if we lack parameters we should point it out? But we are not lacking because the period has a default.\n\n But the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" Here, we have the room and the period is optional. So we can call the function with just the room.\n\n Alternatively, we can set period to something that implies current, like 'Daily'. However, the function doesn't specify what values are allowed. Since the default is 'Daily', we can rely on that.\n\n But note: the function call format must be exact. We are allowed to skip optional parameters? The problem does not specify, but in Python we can. However, in the format we are to output, we must use the exact parameter names.\n\n Since the function has an optional parameter (with default), we can call it with only the required parameter.\n\n However, the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and in the format [func_name(param1=value1, ...)]\n\n So, we can do: [paint_color.trends(room='Living room')]\n\n But note: the function expects the room as a string. We are using 'Living room'. The original question says \"living rooms\" (plural). We can use singular as in the example? The function doesn't specify. But the example in the function docstring says \"Living room\", so we can use that.\n\n Alternatively, we could use 'living room' (case may not matter, but to be safe, we follow the example). The example uses \"Living room\", so we use that.\n\n Let's call the function with room='Living room' and without period (since it's optional and we want the current, which is default). However, the format requires named parameters. We must include the parameter names.\n\n But note: the instruction says to put in the format [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]. So we must use the exact parameter names.\n\n Since period is optional and we are okay with the default, we can skip it? Or should we include it? The instruction doesn't say we must include optional parameters. But the example in the function call format in the instruction shows multiple parameters. However, we are allowed to skip optional ones.\n\n However, the problem says: \"if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the required parameter is `room` and we have it. The period is not required because it has a default.\n\n So, we can call without period.\n\n But to be safe, let's look at the function description: it says \"Default 'Daily'\". So we can omit period.\n\n Therefore, the function call is: [paint_color.trends(room='Living room')]\n\n However, note the function name is `paint_color.trends` and we have to write it exactly.\n\n But wait: the function is named `paint_color.trends` in the list, but in the call we have to use the same. However, in the function call format, we are to write it as a string in the list. The example in the instruction uses `func_name` without module? Actually, the function is given as `paint_color.trends`. So we should use the full name.\n\n Therefore, the call is: [paint_color.trends(room='Living room')]\n\n But note: the function name in the call must be exactly as provided. It includes the dot? Actually, in the function list, it is given as:\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n\n And in the function call example in the instruction, they use `func_name` which might be a simple name? But the instruction says: \"put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\" and the example functions are given with a dot.\n\n However, in the provided functions, the function is named with a dot. That might be a module. But in the context of the tool call, we are to use the fully qualified name? The instruction does not specify. But the example in the instruction does not show a dot. But wait, the instruction example is generic. The functions we are given are:\n\n    # Function: weather_forecast\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n    # Function: house_price_trends\n\n So we have two without a dot and one with. How should we call the one with a dot?\n\n Since the instruction says to use the function name, we should use exactly what is after \"Function: \". That is, for the paint color function, it is \"paint_color.trends\". So we must call it as `paint_color.trends`.\n\n However, in the function call format, we are to write it as a string. So we write: `paint_color.trends(room='Living room')`\n\n But note: the function `paint_color.trends` has a dot. Is that allowed in a function name in the format? The instruction does not forbid it.\n\n Therefore, we output: [paint_color.trends(room='Living room')]\n\n However, let me check: the question says \"living rooms\" (plural). We are using singular \"room\". That's acceptable? The function expects a room type. The example in the function docstring is \"Living room\". So we use the same.\n\n Alternatively, we could try 'living rooms'? But the function doesn't specify plural or singular. We should follow the example in the function: \"Living room\".\n\n So we use 'Living room'.\n\n But note: the function might be case sensitive? We don't know.

So we can omit `month` and rely on default.\n We want \"top rated\" -> set `user_ratings` to 'high'? But note the default for `user_ratings` is already 'high'. \n However, to be explicit and ensure top rated, we can set `user_ratings` to 'high' (or maybe even higher? but the function only takes string and default is 'high').\n\n But note: the function description says \"Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\".\n So we can set:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\" (but note the user said \"modern sculpture\" - however, the function doesn't have a parameter for era. \n   We might have to rely on the function to return modern ones? Or perhaps the function's results are already filtered by modern? \n   The function doesn't specify. Since we cannot pass era, we have to hope that the function returns modern ones? \n   Alternatively, we can note that the user said \"modern\" and maybe we should adjust the art_form? \n   But the function only takes a string for art_form. Let's stick to \"sculpture\" and then we might have to filter? \n   But we cannot filter because we are only calling one function. \n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` returns the most popular exhibitions. We are using user_ratings='high'. \n And the user wants top rated. We are also specifying the art_form as \"sculpture\". \n\n But what about \"modern\"? We don't have a way to specify that. So we have to rely on the function to return modern ones? \n Or maybe we can interpret \"modern\" as the art_form? But the function's art_form is just a string. We could try \"modern sculpture\"? \n\n The function's docstring says: `art_form (str): The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.`\n\n It doesn't specify if we can combine terms. Let's try to be specific: we can set `art_form` to \"modern sculpture\". \n\n Alternatively, we can leave it as \"sculpture\" and then in the results we might get modern ones? \n\n Since we cannot be sure, we'll try to use \"modern sculpture\" if the function allows free text. \n\n So we'll call:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n But note: the function has a parameter `month` that we are leaving as default (which returns upcoming events). \n\n However, the user said \"upcoming month\", which is the next month? The function's default is to return upcoming events, which may include the next month? \n We are not sure, but since we don't have a way to specify \"next month\" exactly, we rely on the default.\n\n So the function call should be:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings='high')\n\n But note: the function parameter for user_ratings is a string and we are using the default value? Actually, the default is 'high'. \n We are setting it to 'high' again? That's the same as default. But to be explicit, it's okay.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n We are providing the required parameters: location and art_form. The other two are optional and we are using defaults.\n\n But note: the function requires `location` and `art_form`? Actually, the function signature shows:\n   location (str): required\n   art_form (str): required\n   month (str): optional\n   user_ratings (str): optional\n\n So we must provide `location` and `art_form`.\n\n Let's write the call:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n But wait, the function name is `find_exhibition` (with an 'i')? Yes, the function is named `find_exhibition`.\n\n However, note: the function is defined as `find_exhibition` (with an 'i') in the function header.\n\n But in the user's request, we are looking for an exhibition. So we are good.\n\n However, we are not sure if \"modern sculpture\" is a valid art_form. It might be that the function expects only basic terms? \n But we don't have any other function to get exhibition by era. So we try.\n\n Alternatively, we could try without \"modern\" and then hope that the top rated ones are modern? \n But the user specifically said \"modern\". \n\n We have to do our best with the provided function.\n\n So we'll call the function with \"modern sculpture\". If the function doesn't return anything, then we might have to adjust? \n But we are only allowed to call the functions we have.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n But note: the function parameter `user_ratings` is spelled correctly? In the function definition it's `user_ratings` (with an 's').\n\n Also, the location: \"New York, NY\" - note the comma and space.\n\n Let me check the function: the example in the docstring for location is \"New York, NY\".\n\n So we are good.\n\n However, what if the function returns multiple exhibitions? The function says \"Locate the most popular exhibitions\", so it returns a list? \n But we are only calling one function and we are to output the function call. We are not processing the results.\n\n So we output the call as above.\n\n But note: the user said \"top rated\", and we set user_ratings='high'. The function returns the most popular (which might be by rating and popularity?).\n\n We are following the function's capabilities.\n\n Therefore, the function call is:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]"}
