{"id": "parallel_multiple_14", "result": "Alright, I have this task to get some data about tiger populations in different countries, both historical and projected. Let's see what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I need the population size of tigers in Bangladesh and India for the last 5 years. So, that sounds like I need historical data for these two countries over the past 5 years.\n\nThen, I also need the projected population size of tigers in Nepal and Malaysia for the next 10 years. That means I need future projections for those two countries, 10 years ahead.\n\nLooking at the functions I have, there's one for getting historical animal population data and another for getting projections.\n\nSo, for Bangladesh and India, I should use the \"animal_population.get_history\" function, right? And for Nepal and Malaysia, I should use \"animal_population.get_projection\".\n\nLet me make sure I understand the parameters for these functions.\n\nFor \"animal_population.get_history\", I need:\n\n- country: string, required\n\n- species: string, required\n\n- years: integer, required\n\nAnd for \"animal_population.get_projection\", I need:\n\n- country: string, required\n\n- species: string, required\n\n- years: integer, required\n\nOkay, so for both functions, I need to specify the country, the species, and the number of years.\n\nIn this case, the species is always \"tigers\", correct? So, species=\"tigers\".\n\nFor the historical data:\n\n- Countries: Bangladesh and India\n\n- Years: 5 (for the last 5 years)\n\nAnd for the projections:\n\n- Countries: Nepal and Malaysia\n\n- Years: 10 (for the next 10 years)\n\nSo, I need to make function calls for each of these.\n\nFirst, for historical data:\n\nI need to call \"animal_population.get_history\" twice:\n\nOnce for Bangladesh:\n\nanimal_population.get_history(country=\"Bangladesh\", species=\"tigers\", years=5)\n\nAnd once for India:\n\nanimal_population.get_history(country=\"India\", species=\"tigers\", years=5)\n\nThen, for projections:\n\nI need to call \"animal_population.get_projection\" twice:\n\nOnce for Nepal:\n\nanimal_population.get_projection(country=\"Nepal\", species=\"tigers\", years=10)\n\nAnd once for Malaysia:\n\nanimal_population.get_projection(country=\"Malaysia\", species=\"tigers\", years=10)\n\nWait a minute, does the projection function give me the population size for each year in the future, or just the total projection for the entire period?\n\nLet me check the description again.\n\nIt says: \"Predict the future population size of a specific species in a given country.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify if it's a total projection or yearly projections. Maybe it's just a single projection for the end of the period.\n\nIf it's just a single projection for 10 years ahead, that might be sufficient. But if it provides yearly projections, that would be even better.\n\nI think I should assume it gives a single projection for the specified number of years into the future.\n\nSo, for the historical data, I'll get the population sizes for the last 5 years for Bangladesh and India.\n\nAnd for the projections, I'll get the projected population sizes for 10 years ahead for Nepal and Malaysia.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements of the task.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider?\n\nOh, I should make sure that the function calls are correctly formatted.\n\nThe instructions say to format them like this:\n\n[func_name1(param1=value1, param2=value2), func_name2(param1=value1)]\n\nSo, for my case, it would be:\n\n[animal_population.get_history(country=\"Bangladesh\", species=\"tigers\", years=5), animal_population.get_history(country=\"India\", species=\"tigers\", years=5), animal_population.get_projection(country=\"Nepal\", species=\"tigers\", years=10), animal_population.get_projection(country=\"Malaysia\", species=\"tigers\", years=10)]\n\nMake sure that all parameters are correctly named and typed.\n\nLooking back at the function definitions:\n\n- country: string, required\n\n- species: string, required\n\n- years: integer, required\n\nYes, I've got all of them as strings except for \"years\", which is an integer.\n\nSo, country=\"Bangladesh\", species=\"tigers\", years=5\n\nLooks good.\n\nI think that's all I need to do for this task.\n\n**Final Output**\n\n```output\n[animal_population.get_history(country=\"Bangladesh\", species=\"tigers\", years=5), animal_population.get_history(country=\"India\", species=\"tigers\", years=5), animal_population.get_projection(country=\"Nepal\", species=\"tigers\", years=10), animal_population.get_projection(country=\"Malaysia\", species=\"tigers\", years=10)]\n```\n", "input_token_count": 666, "output_token_count": 990, "latency": 29.63839602470398}

I need to provide the file path, which is \"dataset.csv\".

So, I need to find out these values for both particles.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the weights. The question asks for the weight of neutrons and protons in amu. I remember that amu stands for atomic mass units, which is a unit used to measure the masses of atoms and subatomic particles. So, I need to find the atomic weights of neutrons and protons in amu.\n\nLooking at the functions I have, there's one called \"scienceFacts.getWeight\". This seems perfect for getting the weight of atomic particles. The function requires two parameters: \"particle\" and \"unit\". The \"particle\" parameter is straightforward; it's the name of the particle, like \"Neutron\" or \"Proton\". The \"unit\" parameter specifies the unit in which the weight should be retrieved, and in this case, it's \"amu\".\n\nSo, for neutrons, I'll call the function with particle=\"Neutron\" and unit=\"amu\". Similarly, for protons, particle=\"Proton\" and unit=\"amu\". That should give me the weights I need.\n\nNext, the question also asks for the diameters of protons and neutrons in femtometers. Again, I have a function for that: \"scienceFacts.getDiameter\". This function also takes two parameters: \"particle\" and \"unit\".

I'm making sure to specify the correct particles and units for each function call.\n\nOne thing to note is that I need to ensure that the function names and parameter names are exactly as specified, because even a small typo could cause the function to fail or return incorrect results.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are spelled correctly.

{"id": "parallel_multiple_59", "result": "\"Alright, I've got this task to prepare a worksheet for my geometry class, and I need to include some area calculation problems. Specifically, I need to calculate the area of a triangle using Heron's formula, the area of a triangle using base and height, and the area of a circle. I have the dimensions for each shape: for the triangle using Heron's formula, the sides are 7 units, 10 units, and 5 units; for the triangle using base and height, the base is 8 units and the height is 6 units; and for the circle, the radius is 4 units.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. Heron's formula allows you to find the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides. The formula involves calculating the semi-perimeter first and then using it to find the area. I think there's a function for that in the math module. Looking at the list of functions, there's one called \"math.triangle_area_heron\" which takes three parameters: side1, side2, and side3. Perfect, that's what I need. So, I'll call that function with side1=7, side2=10, and side3=5.\n\nNext, for the triangle using base and height, there's a straightforward formula: half of the base times the height. I see there's a function for that too, called \"math.triangle_area_base_height\". It requires two parameters: base and height. So, I'll use base=8 and height=6 for this calculation.\n\nLastly, for the circle, the area is calculated using the formula \u03c0 times the radius squared.

{"id": "parallel_multiple_91", "result": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I've got this scenario where I'm studying bacteria that consume glucose and produce energy, some of which is converted into biomass. Then, I need to use that energy to power a machine and calculate the work done. Okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming glucose. I know that the bacteria consumed 5 moles of glucose, and each mole of glucose produces 2800 kJ of energy. So, total energy should be the amount of glucose in moles multiplied by the energy per mole. I think there's a function for that. Looking at the functions provided, there's one called \"biological.calc_energy\". Let's see what it does.\n\nAccording to the description, \"biological.calc_energy\" calculates energy from the amount of substance based on its molecular composition. It takes parameters: mols, substance, and optionally joules_per_mol, with a default value for glucose of 2800 kJ/mol. Perfect, that's exactly what I need.\n\nSo, I'll call biological.calc_energy with mols=5 and substance='C6H12O6'. Since the default joules_per_mol is 2800 kJ/mol for glucose, I don't need to specify it unless I have a different value. In this case, it's 2800 kJ/mol, so I can stick with the default.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure about the units. The energy is given in kJ/mol, but I need to ensure that it's consistent throughout the calculations. Maybe I should confirm the units for the other functions as well.\n\nLooking at \"biological.calc_biomass\", it calculates biomass from energy given the conversion efficiency. The energy parameter is expected in joules, I think. Wait, it just says \"total energy produced\" without specifying units, but probably it's in joules. Similarly, \"physical.calc_work\" takes energy in joules and distance in meters to calculate work.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that the energy I calculate from glucose is in joules. Since 1 kJ = 1000 joules, I need to convert 2800 kJ/mol to joules/mol.\n\nSo, 2800 kJ/mol * 1000 = 2,800,000 joules per mole.\n\nTherefore, when I call biological.calc_energy, I should make sure that joules_per_mol is 2,800,000 joules per mole.\n\nBut the default is probably in kJ, so I need to check that. Wait, the description says \"joules_per_mol\" with a default value for glucose of 2800 kJ/mol. I need to confirm if this default value is in kJ or joules.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll specify joules_per_mol explicitly in joules.\n\nSo, joules_per_mol = 2800 * 1000 = 2,800,000 joules per mole.\n\nTherefore, the function call should be:\n\nbiological.calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800000)\n\nThis should give me the total energy produced in joules.\n\nOkay, once I have the total energy, the next step is to calculate the biomass produced. The conversion efficiency is 10%, meaning that only 10% of the energy is converted into biomass.\n\nLooking at \"biological.calc_biomass\", it takes energy and efficiency as parameters. Efficiency is optional with a default of 10%, which is perfect for this case.\n\nSo, I can call biological.calc_biomass(energy=total_energy_from_glucose, efficiency=0.10)\n\nBut since the default efficiency is 10%, I can omit the efficiency parameter.\n\nTherefore, biological.calc_biomass(energy=total_energy_from_glucose)\n\nwill give me the biomass produced.\n\nNow, for the third part, I need to calculate the work done by the machine. The machine moves a distance of 2 meters, and I need to use the total energy produced by the bacteria.\n\nLooking at \"physical.calc_work\", it calculates work from energy and distance. It takes energy and distance as required parameters.\n\nSo, I'll call physical.calc_work(energy=total_energy_from_glucose, distance=2)\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Work is typically calculated as force multiplied by distance, not directly from energy. Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nActually, energy can be transformed into work, but in this context, it seems that the function is defined to calculate work directly from energy and distance.\n\nPerhaps it's assuming that the energy is used to apply a certain force over that distance, and work is the energy expended in doing so.\n\nBut in physics, work is equal to force times distance, and energy can be converted into work, but the relationship might not be direct without knowing the force involved.\n\nHowever, given the functions provided, I have to work with what's available.\n\nSo, if \"physical.calc_work\" takes energy and distance to calculate work, I'll proceed with that.\n\nAssuming that the energy is entirely converted into work over the given distance.\n\nTherefore, physical.calc_work(energy=total_energy_from_glucose, distance=2)\n\nwill give me the work done by the machine.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the units are consistent. Energy is in joules, and distance is in meters, so work should also be in joules.\n\nWait, actually, in physics, work and energy are both measured in joules, so this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of function calls should be:\n\n1. Calculate the total energy from glucose consumption:\n\nbiological.calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800000)\n\n2.

Calculate the work done by the machine:\n\nphysical.calc_work(energy=total_energy_from_glucose, distance=2)\n\nI think that covers all the parts of the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy produced by bacteria from glucose consumption, the biomass produced from that energy, and the work done by a machine powered by this energy.

The parameters are straightforward: principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate.\n\nSo, the function call will be:\n\n`calc_Simple_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4)`\n\n**Option 2: Compound Interest**\n\n- Principle amount: $5000\n\n- Duration: 5 years\n\n- Annual interest rate: 3.5%\n\n- Compounding frequency: annually (which means compound_freq=1)\n\nFor compound interest, I'll use the `calc_Compound_Interest` function. I need to specify the principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and since it compounds annually, compound_freq=1.\n\nSo, the function call will be:\n\n`calc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1)`\n\n**Option 3: Future Value with Semi-Annual Compounding**\n\n- Initial investment: $3000\n\n- Annual interest rate: 5%\n\n- Time: 6 years\n\n- Compounding frequency: twice a year (num_compoundings=2)\n\nFor this option, I need to use the `future_value` function. The parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the interest rate from percentage to decimal. 5% is 0.05.\n\nSo, the function call will be:\n\n`future_value(initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2)`\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the `future_value` function description, it says \"interest_rate as a decimal.\" So, 5% should indeed be 0.05.\n\nLet me summarize the function calls I need to make:\n\n1. `calc_Simple_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4)`\n\n2. `calc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1)`\n\n3. `future_value(initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2)`\n\nI think that covers all the options John is considering. Once these functions are executed, they should provide the returns for each investment option, which John can then compare to make his decision.\n\n**Final Function Calls:**\n\n```\n\ncalc_Simple_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4),\n\ncalc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1),\n\nfuture_value(initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2)\n\n```\n\n", "input_token_count": 854, "output_token_count": 877, "latency": 26.59442925453186}

I look at the functions, and there's one called \"european_history.get_monarchs.\" That sounds perfect for this part. It needs the country and the century. So, for France in the 17th century, I need to input country=\"France\" and century=17. Wait, the description says that for the 1700s, input '18', so for the 1600s, it should be '17'. Got it.\n\nNext, it mentions major wars that took place in England during the 18th century. Looking at the functions, there's \"european_history.get_events,\" which can provide major historical events based on country and century, and optionally, the type of event. Since it specifically asks for wars, I can set event_type='war'. So, country=\"England\", century=18, and event_type='war'.\n\nLastly, it wants prominent art movements in Italy during the 19th century. There's a function called \"european_history.get_culture\" that provides information on cultural aspects including art movements. It needs country and century, and optionally, the aspect of culture. Since it's art movements, I can set aspect='art'. So, country=\"Italy\", century=19, and aspect='art'.\n\nSo, to summarize, I need to make three function calls:\n\n1. european_history.get_monarchs(country=\"France\", century=17)\n\n2. european_history.get_events(country=\"England\", century=18, event_type='war')\n\n3. european_history.get_culture(country=\"Italy\", century=19, aspect='art')\n\nI think that covers all the parts of the question.

Who the top scorer of Manchester United is in the same competition (Premier League), and how that compares to Cristiano Ronaldo's goals.\n\n3. Who the top scorer of the Premier League was in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nI have a set of functions available that can help me fetch this information. Let's see which functions are relevant for each part of the query.\n\nFirst, for getting the all-time goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United in the Premier League, I can use the `player_stats.get_all_time_goals` function. This function requires the player's name and the team's name, and optionally, the competition, which in this case is the Premier League. Since the user specified the Premier League, I should include that in the parameters to ensure the data is accurate.\n\nSo, for the first part, I'll call:\n\n`player_stats.get_all_time_goals(player_name=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\")`\n\nNext, the user wants to compare Ronaldo's goals with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. To find the top scorer of a specific team, I can use the `team_stats.get_top_scorer` function. This function requires the team's name and optionally the competition, which again is the Premier League.\n\nSo, for the second part, I'll call:\n\n`team_stats.get_top_scorer(team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\")`\n\nThis should give me the top scorer for Manchester United in the Premier League, and presumably, the number of goals they scored. I can then compare this with Ronaldo's all-time goals to see how they stack up.\n\nLastly, the user wants to know who the top scorer of the Premier League was in the 2019-2020 season. For this, I can use the `league_stats.get_top_scorer` function. This function requires the league's name and optionally the season.

{"id": "parallel_multiple_124", "result": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, you need help planning your meals for the day. You have specific requirements for each meal, so I'll break it down.\n\nStarting with breakfast: you want a recipe that uses eggs, milk, and bread, and it should not exceed 300 calories. I think the 'recipe_search' function can help with this. It allows you to search for recipes based on a list of ingredients and a maximum caloric value. You also mentioned that it's for breakfast, so I can specify the meal type as breakfast.\n\nSo, for breakfast, I'll use:\n\nrecipe_search(ingredients=['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories=300, meal='breakfast')\n\nNext, for lunch, you want to try a new restaurant that serves dishes with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, and the dishes should not be more than 500 calories. There's a 'restaurant_search' function that seems perfect for this. It searches for restaurants based on preferred ingredients and maximum calorie count. Again, since it's for lunch, I can specify the meal type as lunch.\n\nSo, for lunch, I'll use:\n\nrestaurant_search(ingredients=['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories=500, meal='lunch')\n\nNow, for dinner, you have a recipe that uses beef, but you want to replace the beef with tofu and keep the total calories under 600. There's an 'ingredient_replace' function that replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute while keeping the calories below a certain number. However, I need to make sure that this function can be used in this context.\n\nWait a minute, the 'ingredient_replace' function seems to be designed to replace an ingredient in an existing recipe and adjust the calories accordingly. But in this case, you already have a recipe that uses beef, and you want to replace beef with tofu, ensuring the total calories are under 600.\n\nSo, for dinner, I'll use:\n\ningredient_replace(original_ingredient='beef', replacement_ingredient='tofu', calories=600)\n\nBut, I need to consider if this function requires more information, like the original recipe or its calorie count. Looking back at the function description, it says it replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute, keeping the calories below a certain number. It seems to assume that the recipe is known, and it adjusts the substitution accordingly.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, you have an existing recipe that uses beef, and you want to replace beef with tofu, ensuring the total calories are under 600. But the function doesn't specify how to input the original recipe or its calorie count. It only takes the original ingredient, replacement ingredient, and the maximum calories.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps I should first find a recipe that uses beef and then replace the beef with tofu, but I need to ensure that the total calories are under 600. Alternatively, maybe I should search for recipes that use tofu instead of beef and have calories under 600.\n\nWait, but you specifically have a recipe that uses beef and want to replace beef with tofu in that recipe, keeping calories under 600. In that case, perhaps I need to use the 'ingredient_replace' function, assuming it can handle this scenario.\n\nSo, for dinner, I'll proceed with:\n\ningredient_replace(original_ingredient='beef', replacement_ingredient='tofu', calories=600)\n\nBut I should note that this might not consider the specific recipe you have; it might just provide a general substitution that keeps the calories under the specified limit.\n\nAlright, summarizing the function calls:\n\n1. recipe_search(ingredients=['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories=300, meal='breakfast')\n\n2. restaurant_search(ingredients=['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories=500, meal='lunch')\n\n3. ingredient_replace(original_ingredient='beef', replacement_ingredient='tofu', calories=600)\n\nI think these function calls should help you plan your meals according to your requirements.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo plan the user's meals for the day with specific ingredient and calorie constraints, the following functions will be utilized:\n\n1. **Breakfast Recipe Search**:\n   - Function: `recipe_search`\n   - Parameters:\n     - ingredients: ['eggs', 'milk', 'bread']\n     - calories: 300\n     - meal: 'breakfast'\n   - Purpose: Find a breakfast recipe using the specified ingredients with a calorie limit.\n\n2. **Lunch Restaurant Search**:\n   - Function: `restaurant_search`\n   - Parameters:\n     - ingredients: ['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce']\n     - calories: 500\n     - meal: 'lunch'\n   - Purpose: Find a restaurant offering lunch dishes with the specified ingredients and within the calorie limit.\n\n3. **Dinner Ingredient Replacement**:\n   - Function: `ingredient_replace`\n   - Parameters:\n     - original_ingredient: 'beef'\n     - replacement_ingredient: 'tofu'\n     - calories: 600\n   - Purpose: Replace beef with tofu in a dinner recipe while ensuring the total calories do not exceed the specified limit.\n\n**Function Calls**\n\n```python\nrecipe_search(ingredients=['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories=300, meal='breakfast')\nrestaurant_search(ingredients=['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories=500, meal='lunch')\ningredient_replace(original_ingredient='beef', replacement_ingredient='tofu', calories=600)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- The `recipe_search` function is used to find a suitable breakfast recipe using eggs, milk, and bread, ensuring it does not exceed 300 calories.\n- The `restaurant_search` function helps in finding a restaurant that serves lunch dishes containing chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, with each dish having no more than 500 calories.\n- The `ingredient_replace` function is employed to substitute beef with tofu in a dinner recipe, adjusting the recipe to keep the total calories under 600.", "input_token_count": 825, "output_token_count": 1296, "latency": 34.45269823074341}

I'll proceed to call these functions in sequence.\n\nFirst, predict the house price:\n\npredict_house_price(area=2000, rooms=4, year=1985, location=\"San Francisco\")\n\nThen, search for lawsuits:\n\nlawsuit_search(entity=\"Mr. John Doe\", county=\"San Francisco\")\n\nAnd finally, calculate the probability:\n\ncalculate_probability(total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3)\n\nThat should give me all the information the user is looking for.\n\n**Final Output**\n\nTo fulfill the user's request, the following function calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Predict House Price**\n\n   - Function Name: `predict_house_price`\n\n   - Parameters:\n\n     - area: 2000\n\n     - rooms: 4\n\n     - year: 1985\n\n     - location: \"San Francisco\"\n\n   - Call: `predict_house_price(area=2000, rooms=4, year=1985, location=\"San Francisco\")`\n\n2. **Search for Lawsuits**\n\n   - Function Name: `lawsuit_search`\n\n   - Parameters:\n\n     - entity: \"Mr. John Doe\"\n\n     - county: \"San Francisco\"\n\n   - Call: `lawsuit_search(entity=\"Mr. John Doe\", county=\"San Francisco\")`\n\n3. **Calculate Probability**\n\n   - Function Name: `calculate_probability`\n\n   - Parameters:\n\n     - total_outcomes: 1000\n\n     - favorable_outcomes: 5\n\n     - round_to: 3\n\n   - Call: `calculate_probability(total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3)`", "input_token_count": 828, "output_token_count": 959, "latency": 27.014352798461914}
{"id": "parallel_multiple_167", "result": "Alright, let's tackle these tasks one by one.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what types of fish are collectable in the game 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. For this, I'll use the function get_collectables_in_season. I'll specify the game_name as 'Animal Crossing', the season as 'Summer', and the item_type as 'fish'.\n\nNext, I need to find the highest score achieved by any player in the game 'Fortnite' on the 'Playstation' platform in the 'Asia' region. I'll use the function game_score.highest for this, setting the game to 'Fortnite', the platform to 'Playstation', and the region to 'Asia'.\n\nThen, I need to get details of lawsuits involving the company 'Apple Inc.' in the year 2018. I'll use the function lawsuit_details.find, providing the company_name as 'Apple Inc.' and the year as 2018.\n\nLastly, I need to calculate the binomial probability for 10 trials, with 3 successes and a probability of success of 0.7 on an individual trial. I'll use the function calculate_binomial_probability, setting number_of_trials to 10, number_of_successes to 3, and probability_of_success to 0.7.\n\nSo, the function calls will be:\n\nget_collectables_in_season(game_name='Animal Crossing', season='Summer', item_type='fish'),\n\ngame_score.highest(game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation', region='Asia'),\n\nlawsuit_details.find(company_name='Apple Inc.', year=2018),\n\ncalculate_binomial_probability(number_of_trials=10, number_of_successes=3, probability_of_success=0.7)", "input_token_count": 976, "output_token_count": 361, "latency": 12.220542669296265}
