Also, the time parameters need to be lists, so 5 pm and 7:30 pm. \n\nBut the function's parameters are movie (list) and time (list).

Similarly, for navy using acrylic, the parameters would be paint_type 'acrylic' and color 'navy'. \n\nI should make sure there are no other parameters needed. The function only requires paint_type and color, so both calls should be sufficient. The user also asked for quantities, but the function doesn't mention quantity. Wait, maybe the function returns the combination without quantities, but the user might need to calculate them. However, the problem statement doesn't specify quantities, so perhaps the function is designed to return the colors, and the quantities are implied. \n\nSince the user's question includes both color and quantity, but the function doesn't require quantity, I can only provide the color combinations. The quantities might be part of the function's output, but since the user hasn't provided them, I can't include them.
