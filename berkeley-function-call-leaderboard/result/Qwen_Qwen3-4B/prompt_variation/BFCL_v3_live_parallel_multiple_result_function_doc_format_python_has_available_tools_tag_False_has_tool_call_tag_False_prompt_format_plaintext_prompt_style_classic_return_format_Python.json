There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user wants a Caesar salad but without anchovies. The ChaFod function takes foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. So foodItem is \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". New ingredients might not be needed here since they didn't specify adding anything else. Special instructions could be anything else, but the user didn't mention any, so maybe leave that blank.\n\nThen the drink: They want to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function requires drink_id and new_preferences. Drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should be a dictionary with keys like size, type, sweetness, milk. So \"large\", \"hot coffee\", \"regular\", \"almond milk\". Wait, the function's new_preferences is a dict, so I need to structure that correctly. Maybe {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nCheck if all parameters are provided. For the food, the user didn't mention new ingredients, so newIngredients is default empty. RemoveIngredients is \"anchovies\".

The get_news_report function can retrieve news based on location, category, and language. The parameters required are location, category, and language. The location needs to be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, France, since it's a city in a country, I can use 'Paris, France'. For Letterkenny, Ireland, it should be 'Letterkenny, Ireland' as well. The category for the second query is technology, and the language is English for both.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"again in English\" for the second one.

The user wants me to follow specific steps to clone a repo, analyze it, create Docker and Kubernetes files, then commit and push changes. \n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function clone_repo requires repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. The default destination is current directory, so I can leave that as is. Recursive and depth aren't specified, so I'll use defaults. So the first function call should be clone_repo with the repo_url provided.\n\nNext, step 2.1 says to analyze the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents takes directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' or maybe the current directory. Wait, the clone_repo's destination is default to '.', so the repo is in the current directory. But the function analyse_repo_contents expects a directory name relative to the root. So maybe the directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'? Or maybe the current directory? Hmm, the user's step 2.1 says \"analyse the contents of the repo\", so the directory name would be the name of the cloned repo. So I think the directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter analyzing, step 2.1 says to create/update Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file takes directory_name, which should be the same as the repo directory. So again, 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs. The function create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name, which is the same as before. But wait, the parameters for create_kubernetes_yaml_file include deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I need to use defaults. The default for deployment_name is not provided, but the function's args say deployment_name is a parameter with default. Wait, looking back: the create_kubernetes_yaml_file's args have deployment_name as a parameter with default? Let me check the function definition again.\n\nLooking at the function create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n\nArgs:\n    directory_name (str): The name of the directory where the repo is located. This will be used to name the Kubernetes deployment and service.\n    deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n    image_name (str, default='latest'): The name of the Docker image to be used in the deployment. use latest if not provided\n    replicas (int, default=1): The number of pod replicas to be deployed.\n    port (int, default=80): The container port that the service will expose.\n    service_type (str, default='ClusterIP'): The type of the Kubernetes service to create.\n\nWait, the deployment_name has a default? The description says \"use Defaults if not provided\", but in the parameters, it's listed as a required argument? Wait, the function's parameters are defined as:\n\nArgs:\n    directory_name (str): ...\n    deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n    image_name (str, default='latest'): ...\n    replicas (int, default=1): ...\n    port (int, default=80): ...\n    service_type (str, default='ClusterIP'): ...\n\nSo, the deployment_name is a required parameter? Or is it optional with a default? The description says \"use Defaults if not provided\", but in the parameters, it's not marked as optional. Wait, the function's parameters are defined with default values? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the function definition:\n\nThe create_kubernetes_yaml_file's args are:\n\n- directory_name (str): required\n- deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n- image_name (str, default='latest'): ...\n- replicas (int, default=1): ...\n- port (int, default=80): ...\n- service_type (str, default='ClusterIP'): ...\n\nSo, the deployment_name is a required parameter? Or is it optional? The description says \"use Defaults if not provided\", which might imply that if not provided, it uses a default. But in the parameters, it's not marked as having a default. So maybe the user is supposed to provide it, but the function has a default? Wait, the function's parameters are written as:\n\ndeployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n\nBut in the parameters, the image_name has a default. So perhaps deployment_name is required, but the user can provide a default? Or maybe the function is designed to have a default for deployment_name. But the way it's written, the parameters for the function are:\n\ndef create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name, deployment_name, image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP'):\n\nSo, the deployment_name is a required parameter. Therefore, the user must provide it. However, the user's instruction says to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. But the user hasn't specified the deployment name, image name, etc. So perhaps the function uses the directory name as the deployment name. The function's description says: \"directory_name (str): The name of the directory where the repo is located. This will be used to name the Kubernetes deployment and service.\" So the deployment_name is derived from the directory name. Therefore, in this case, the deployment_name would be the directory name, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. So the user doesn't need to specify it, but the function requires it. Wait, but the function's parameters have deployment_name as a required argument. Therefore, the user must provide it. But the function's description says that the directory name is used to name the deployment and service. So maybe the deployment_name is set to the directory name. Therefore, in this case, the deployment_name would be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo for step 2.2, the function call would be create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', and the other parameters using their defaults. So the parameters would be:\n\ndirectory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP'.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified any of these, so we have to use the defaults. However, the function's parameters for deployment_name is required. Therefore, the user must provide it. But the function's description says that the directory name is used to name the deployment and service. Therefore, the deployment_name is set to the directory name. So in this case, the deployment_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo the function call would be create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP').\n\nBut the user's instruction says to create the YAMLs based on the analysis. The analysis would determine the programming language, which might influence the Dockerfile and Kubernetes setup. However, the user hasn't provided any specific details, so we proceed with the defaults.\n\nThen step 3 is to add all changed files to git. The function push_git_changes_to_github is for pushing, but step 3 says \"add all changed files to git changes\". Wait, the function push_git_changes_to_github is for pushing, but adding changes is done with git add. However, the available functions don't include a git add function. The user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", but the available functions don't have a function for that. However, the push_git_changes_to_github function does a git add automatically. Wait, the function push_git_changes_to_github's description says: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, perhaps the user's step 3 is to add changes, but the function push_git_changes_to_github does that. However, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is equivalent to git add. But the available functions don't have a separate git add function. Therefore, maybe the user's step 3 is to call push_git_changes_to_github, which would add the changes and then push. But the user's step 3 is to add the changes, then step 4 is to commit and push. Wait, the user's steps are:\n\n3. add all changed file to git changes \n4. commit / push to repo\n\nBut the available functions don't have a function to add changes. However, the push_git_changes_to_github function does git add automatically. So perhaps the user's step 3 is to call push_git_changes_to_github, but that would also push. But the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a commit function. The push_git_changes_to_github function does a commit and push. Wait, the function's description says: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, the function does git add, commit, and push. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github does both adding and pushing. Therefore, perhaps the user's step 3 and 4 can be handled by calling push_git_changes_to_github once, which would add, commit, and push. But the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the function does both. So maybe the user's steps 3 and 4 are combined into one function call.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes, which is git add. The function push_git_changes_to_github does that. Then step 4 is to commit and push. But the function push_git_changes_to_github does that as well. Therefore, perhaps the user's steps 3 and 4 can be handled by calling push_git_changes_to_github once. However, the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. But the function does both. Therefore, the correct function call would be push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message as 'Update changes', branch_name as 'main', and force_push as False.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github does both. Therefore, the user's steps 3 and 4 can be handled by calling this function once.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStep 1: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='.', recursive=False, depth=None)\n\nStep 2.1: analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nStep 2.2: create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nStep 2.2: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP')\n\nStep 3: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github does that. So the function call would be push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name as the repo directory.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github does both. Therefore, the correct function call is to use push_git_changes_to_github once.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the function does both. Therefore, the answer would be to call the push function once.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github does both. Therefore, the answer is to call that function once.\n\nSo the final function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut need to check if all parameters are provided.\n\nFor clone_repo, the repo_url is given, destination is default, recursive and depth are default.\n\nFor analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', deployment_name is 'nodejs-welcome', image_name is 'latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP'.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message is 'Update changes', branch_name is 'main', force_push is False.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)]"}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and also get the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, the user asked to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The search_string should be 'CellResult', and since they want to include subdirectories, I'll set include_subdirectories to True. The case_sensitive parameter is optional and defaults to False, so I can leave that as is.\n\nNext, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. For each method, I'll call get_signature with class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. The include_private parameter is optional and defaults to False, so unless they need private methods, which they didn't mention, I can omit it.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. But the error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class is part of the same repository, and the user needs to check its methods. However, the user's main request is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get the method signatures from 'AbstractCellHandler'. So the first step is to use get_relevant_classes with the search string 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then, get the signatures for the two methods in AbstractCellHandler.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. For get_relevant_classes, the args are search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True. Then for each method, call get_signature with the respective method names. So three function calls in total: one to get relevant classes and two to get the method signatures."}

The unit isn't specified, but the function's default is Fahrenheit, but wait, that's for temperature. Oh, no, the get_area_of_square function's parameter is 'size' as a float. So 5 cm is the size, so the area would be 5 squared, which is 25 cm\u00b2. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. Maybe that's a typo? But the function get_current_weather requires a location. The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\", which might be a mistake. But the function can take a location like 'City, Country'. So maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but the user wrote Singapore. However, the function can handle that. So I'll call get_current_weather with location 'Queenstown, Singapore' and unit as default Fahrenheit. But wait, Singapore is a country, so maybe the correct location is 'Queenstown, New Zealand', but the user specified Singapore. Hmm. But the function can take 'City, Country' format. So I'll proceed with the given location as per the user's question.\n\nSo two function calls: one for the area, and one for the weather. The parameters are clear.

The event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play\", and the city is Los Angeles. The date is 2023-03-10. \n\nWait, the user mentioned both music concerts and theater plays. So maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. Or maybe the event_type can handle both? But the parameters specify event_type as a single string. So perhaps I should make two separate calls: one with event_type=\"concert\" and another with event_type=\"theater play\" or \"play\". \n\nThe city should be formatted as 'Los Angeles, CA' since the function examples use that format. The date is 2023-03-10. So the function calls would be:\n\nEvents_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\")\nEvents_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"play\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\")\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"theater play\" is the exact term. But the function's example uses \"concerts and plays\", so \"play\" might be sufficient. Let me check the function's description again. The event_type is the category, so \"concert\" and \"play\" should work. \n\nI think that's the right approach. So two function calls are needed here."}

They want two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the first part about searching a hair stylist would use Services_1_FindProvider. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The city is given as Sunnyvale, CA, which fits the format 'City, State (abbr)'. The user didn't mention anything about the salon being unisex, so I should set is_unisex to 'dontcare' as that's the default.\n\nNext, booking the appointment requires Services_1_BookAppointment. The parameters here are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user specified 'Elegant Styles' as the salon, so that's the stylist_name. The time is 15:00, which is in 24-hour format, and the date is 2023-05-10. All required parameters are provided here.\n\nI need to make sure both functions are called. The first function to find the provider and then the second to book the appointment. No missing parameters here, so both should work."}
