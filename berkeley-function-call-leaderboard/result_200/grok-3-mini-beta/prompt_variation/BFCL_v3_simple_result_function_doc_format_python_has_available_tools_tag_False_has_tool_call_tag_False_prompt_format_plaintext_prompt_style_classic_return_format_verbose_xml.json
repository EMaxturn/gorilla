In the format, it's probably as a string representation, like \"['pet-friendly']\", but I need to make sure it's correct. The instructions don't specify, but in XML, it might just be a string that represents the value.\n\nIn the example, it's <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>, so for an array, value should be something like \"['pet-friendly']\", assuming it's serialized as a string.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nAlright, that's my response."}
