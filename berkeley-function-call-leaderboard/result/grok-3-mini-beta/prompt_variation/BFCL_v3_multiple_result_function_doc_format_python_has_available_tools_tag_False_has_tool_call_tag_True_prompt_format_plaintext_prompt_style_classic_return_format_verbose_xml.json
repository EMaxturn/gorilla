I think I just put it as a string representation, but I need to ensure it's correctly formatted.\n\nLooking back at the instructions: \"value=\"value1\"\" \u2013 it should be a string that represents the value. For a dict, I can use a string that looks like a Python dict.\n\nIn the example, it's like value=\"value1\", so for a dict, I'll use something like value=\"{'math':90, 'science':75, 'history':82, 'music':89}\" and type=\"dict\".\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"calculate_average\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"gradeDict\" value=\"{'math':90, 'science':75, 'history':82, 'music':89}\" type=\"dict\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nI think that's it. This should fulfill the user's request in one turn.\n\nThe user mentioned \"for student John\", but the function doesn't take a student name as a parameter. It just needs the gradeDict. So, I don't need to do anything extra for that.\n\nI've checked if any other functions are needed, but no, this is straightforward."}

It allows deletion or addition of columns.\n\n   - Args: db_name (str), table (str), operation (str: 'delete' or 'add'), columns (list)\n\n2. **database.create_backup**: This is for creating a backup before modification.\n\n   - Args: db_name (str), backup_location (str), timestamp (bool, optional)\n\nBefore modifying, it's a good practice to create a backup, as mentioned in the function description: \"This function creates a backup of the database before modification\".\n\nSo, I should first call **database.create_backup** to ensure data safety, and then call **database.modify_columns** to delete the columns.\n\nThe user didn't specify a backup location or whether to use a timestamp. The function requires db_name and backup_location, and timestamp is optional with a default.\n\nThe question lacks the backup_location parameter. I need to point that out if required, but in the instructions, it says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" However, for function calls, I have to use what's available.\n\nIn the response format, I should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. I can't add extra text.\n\nI need to make assumptions or use defaults where possible. For backup_location, it's required, so I can't call the function without it.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in the response, I should only return the function calls or nothing if not possible.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But then it specifies to only return the function calls in <TOOLCALL>.\n\nThere's a conflict. The prompt says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" So, if I need to point something out, how do I do that?\n\nPerhaps I should only proceed if I can make a valid call. For database.create_backup, backup_location is required, and the user didn't provide it.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, I have all the info: db_name is \"employees\", table is \"personal_data\", operation is \"delete\", columns are [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] or something similar.\n\nThe user said: \"delete some columns from my employees database on personal_data table. I want to remove their email addresses and social security numbers\"\n\nSo, inferred:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\"\n\n- table: \"personal_data\"\n\n- operation: \"delete\"\n\n- columns: [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] \u2013 I'm assuming the column names are \"email\" and \"social_security_number\".\n\nFor backup, I don't have backup_location.\n\nI should call database.create_backup first, but I need backup_location. Since it's not provided, I can't call it.\n\nThe function has timestamp as optional, but backup_location is not.\n\nPerhaps I can skip the backup if I don't have the info, but that might not be safe.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nTo complete the task, I need to modify the columns, so I can call that function directly.\n\nBut the function descriptions suggest creating a backup first.\n\nHowever, since backup_location is missing, I should just call the modify function.\n\nI need to check if I can make the call with what I have.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, I have all parameters:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\" (string)\n\n- table: \"personal_data\" (string)\n\n- operation: \"delete\" (string)\n\n- columns: list, e.g., [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] (array of strings)\n\nSo, I can call that.\n\nFor backup, I can't because of missing backup_location.\n\nI should just call database.modify_columns.\n\nTo be thorough, perhaps call backup first if possible, but since it's not, proceed to the main task.\n\nThe prompt doesn't specify creating a backup; it's just an available function. The user didn't ask for it, so maybe I don't need to.\n\nThe user said: \"I need to delete some columns...\", so directly, I can use modify_columns.\n\nI think the best is to call database.modify_columns with the available info.\n\nSo, my response should be just the <TOOLCALL> for that function.\n\nFormat:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"database.modify_columns\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"db_name\" value=\"employees\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"table\" value=\"personal_data\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"operation\" value=\"delete\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"columns\" value=\"['email', 'social_security_number']\" type=\"array\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor the columns parameter, it's a list of strings, so value should be something like \"['email', 'social_security_number']\", and type=\"array\".\n\nIn the prompt, it says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nSo, for columns, it's an array.\n\nI assumed the column names; the user didn't specify exact names, but \"email addresses\" likely means \"email\", and \"social security numbers\" likely means \"social_security_number\".

Default value is -9.81\n\nIn my tool call, I need to provide the params that are required or that I want to override.\n\nFrom the function: initial_velocity and time are required, acceleration is optional.\n\nSo, I'll provide initial_velocity and time.\n\nTypes:\n\n- initial_velocity: int (as per function, even though user said 40 m/s, which is an integer)\n\n- time: int (6 seconds, integer)\n\nIn the function doc: initial_velocity (int), time (int), so I need to pass them as integers.\n\nIn my response, for the tool call, I specify the type as per the actual value: integer.\n\nNow, format for tool call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"kinematics.final_velocity\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"initial_velocity\" value=\"40\" type=\"integer\"/>\n\n<param name=\"time\" value=\"6\" type=\"integer\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct. I don't need to include acceleration since it's default.\n\nThis should fulfill the user's request in one call.\n\nOnce I make this call, the system will execute it and provide the result, so I don't need to do anything else in this turn."}

I need to match this.\n\nIn the provided code, it's: features (list, default='timings, exhibitions')\n\nBut in the Python format, it's likely expecting a string that can be split, or perhaps a list.

The type should be one of the specified: string, integer, etc. Since it's a list of strings, I should probably pass it as a string, like \"timings, exhibitions, accessibility\", and specify the type as \"string\".\n\nThe tool call format says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nSo, for a list, I can use \"array\".\n\nIn the function definition, it's \"features (list, ...)\", so in the tool call, I should use type=\"array\" for it.\n\nTo be precise, I'll pass it as an array.\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- Function name: museum_info\n\n- Params:\n\n  - museum: \"Natural History Museum\" (type: string)\n\n  - city: \"London\" (type: string)\n\n  - features: [\"timings\", \"exhibitions\", \"accessibility\"] (type: array)\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nI need to format it exactly as specified in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe response should only contain the <TOOLCALL> part, nothing else.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"museum_info\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"museum\" value=\"Natural History Museum\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"city\" value=\"London\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"features\" value=\"['timings', 'exhibitions', 'accessibility']\" type=\"array\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor the value of an array, how should I format it?

The user provided 'Cyberpunk 2077', so I can use that.\n\n- platform (str): The gaming platform, e.g., Xbox, Playstation, PC. The user specified 'Xbox', so that's good.\n\n- region (str): Optional, default is 'global'.

Vegan is a subset of vegetarian, but not exactly the same. Also, none of the functions mention gluten-free.\n\nKey issues:\n\n1. The functions only provide vegan products, not vegetarian or gluten-free.\n\n2. Even for Walmart, it's only vegan products, and it doesn't filter for gluten-free.\n\nThe function walmart.vegan_products has parameters:\n\n- location: str, e.g., Denver, CO\n\n- categories: list, default empty array\n\nIt doesn't have a way to specify vegetarian (which might overlap with vegan) or gluten-free. The categories parameter might be used for subcategories, but the description doesn't specify what categories are available, and it's not clear if \"gluten-free\" is a category.\n\nThe user asked for \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", but the function is for \"vegan_products\". I need to check if this matches:\n\n- Vegan products are vegetarian, but not all vegetarian products are vegan.\n\n- There's no mention of gluten-free in any function.\n\nSo, this function doesn't fully match the request because:\n\n- It only gets vegan products, not all vegetarian.\n\n- It doesn't filter for gluten-free.\n\nIf I call walmart.vegan_products, I could get vegan products, which are a subset of vegetarian, but it won't ensure gluten-free.\n\nThe question lacks parameters for categories. The user didn't specify any categories, but the function allows an empty array, which might return all vegan products.\n\nHowever, since the function doesn't support gluten-free, I can't fulfill the entire request.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIn this case, the functions don't match the query precisely, so I should not call any function or indicate that.\n\nBut the response format is strict: I should only return function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section, or if not, perhaps not respond with anything, but the instructions say: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nRe-reading: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I don't invoke any, what should I do? The system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But it also says to only return function calls in that format.\n\nThis is conflicting. Let me check: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then, \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to not output anything if I can't call a function, but that doesn't make sense. The prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI could output an empty response or just not include <TOOLCALL>.\n\nTo be precise, I think I should not make a function call if it's not appropriate.\n\nMaybe I can call walmart.vegan_products with the location, as it's the closest match, and assume that vegan products might include some that are gluten-free, but that's not accurate.\n\nThe function is for vegan_products, and the user asked for vegetarian and gluten-free. It's not a perfect match.\n\nPerhaps I can call it and let the system handle it, but I need to be accurate.\n\nAnother thought: The function might allow categories like [\"gluten-free\"], but the description doesn't specify. It's risky.\n\nThe best action is to not call any function because it doesn't fully match.\n\nThe instructions: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, perhaps call walmart.vegan_products for Denver, with no categories, as a partial response.\n\nBut the user specified \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", so I should point out the mismatch.\n\nI can't point it out in the response; I have to use the <TOOLCALL> format or not.\n\nPerhaps I should just not output anything, but that seems wrong.\n\nLet's look back: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... If you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nFor this, I can decide not to invoke any.\n\nIn practice, I think the expectation is to only output <TOOLCALL> if calling a function.\n\nPerhaps I can call it with categories that might match, like [\"vegetarian\", \"gluten-free\"], even if it's not exact.\n\nThe function description says: \"Product categories to search within. Default empty array\"\n\nIt doesn't specify what categories are available, so I could try.\n\nFor example, pass categories as [\"vegetarian\", \"gluten-free\"].\n\nBut the function is named vegan_products, so it might only return vegan items, and categories might be subcategories of vegan products.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume I can call it with the location and try the categories.\n\nSo, for the user: location = \"Denver, CO\"\n\ncategories = [\"vegetarian\", \"gluten-free\"]  # Even though it might not work, it's the best I can do.\n\nThe function is for vegan_products, so passing \"vegetarian\" might not make sense.\n\nPerhaps just pass an empty array and get all vegan products, as they are vegetarian.\n\nBut that ignores gluten-free.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the system expects me to call it as is.\n\nLet me decide: I'll call walmart.vegan_products with location \"Denver, CO\" and categories [\"gluten-free\"], hoping that \"gluten-free\" is a category.\n\nSo, function call: walmart.vegan_products with location as string, categories as array of strings.\n\nYes.\n\nFinal decision: Make the function call."}

I need to format this as a list.\n\nWhat should the list look like? The function description doesn't specify the exact format, but in programming, conditions for a query are often a list of strings or dictionaries.

The args say conditions (list), so I'll assume it's a list of strings or something similar. For example, it could be [\"age > 25\", \"job = 'engineer'\"].\n\nI need to make sure I provide the correct type. In the tool call, for each param, I specify the type, which must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\nFor conditions, since it's a list, I should use \"array\" as the type in the tool call.\n\nIn the tool call format: <param name=\"conditions\" value=\"some_value\" type=\"array\"/>\n\nWhat should the value be? I need to serialize it appropriately. Probably as a JSON-like string or directly as a list representation.\n\nIn the example format, it's like value=\"value1\", so for a list, I might need to use a string that represents the list, like \"['age > 25', 'job = \\'engineer\\']\".\n\nThe tool call format says: value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\", and for arrays, it should be something that can be parsed.\n\nTo be precise, I'll assume I need to provide a string that represents the array, as in Python.\n\nSo, for database.query, I need:\n\n- name: \"database.query\"\n\n- params:\n\n  - param name=\"table\" value=\"user\" type=\"string\"\n\n  - param name=\"conditions\" value=\"['age > 25', 'job == \\'engineer\\']\" type=\"array\"  (or perhaps type=\"string\" if it's a string representation)\n\nThe type for the param should match what's expected: for conditions, it's a list, so type=\"array\".\n\nIn the tool call, value should be a string representation of that array.\n\nI think it's fine to use a string like \"['age > 25', 'job == \\'engineer\\'']\".\n\nDoes the function expect a specific format for the conditions list? The description doesn't specify, so I'll go with a simple list of strings.\n\nThe user said: \"age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'\". So, in query terms, that's two conditions combined with AND.\n\nIn the function, it's just a list of conditions, so perhaps the function handles the AND logic, or I need to include it.\n\nI'll assume passing a list like [\"age > 25\", \"job = 'engineer'\"] is sufficient.\n\nOne function call should suffice here.\n\nFinally, structure the response only with the <TOOLCALL> section."}

Re-reading: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIt says to point it out, but then specifies to only return function calls in <TOOLCALL>. Perhaps I shouldn't make the call if parameters are missing.\n\nThe exact instruction: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nSo, if I can't invoke it properly, I shouldn't include it.\n\nIn practice, for this exercise, I think I need to either call it with what I have or not at all.\n\nI could call it and provide a value for language based on inference. The text is English, so language=\"english\" or \"en\".\n\nIn the function, it's \"language (str)\", so something like \"English\" should work.\n\nI think it's reasonable to assume English.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with calling sentiment_analysis with text as the provided string and language as \"English\".\n\nFunction call format:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"sentiment_analysis\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"text\" value=\"I love the food here!

This seems relevant.\n\n3. **get_sculpture_info**: This retrieves info about a specific sculpture by an artist, including year and details. It's not about finding exhibitions; it's about individual artworks.\n\nThe most appropriate function is **find_exhibition** because it deals with exhibitions and allows specifying location, art form, month, and user ratings.\n\nLet's map the user's query to the function's parameters:\n\n- **location**: The user specified \"New York\". I should use \"New York, NY\" as per the example, but the user said \"New York\", so I'll assume it's fine, but to be precise, the function example uses \"New York, NY\". I'll use what's given: \"New York\".\n\n- **art_form**: The user said \"modern sculpture\". The function's description says e.g., \"sculpture\". I need to check if \"modern sculpture\" fits. The parameter is \"art_form (str): The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" So, probably \"sculpture\" is the art form, and \"modern\" might be implied or not directly supported. I'll use \"sculpture\" as it's the closest.\n\n- **month**: The user said \"in the upcoming month\". The function says \"month (str): The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" If I don't specify, it defaults to upcoming events, which matches \"upcoming month\". So, I might not need to specify it, or I could if I knew the exact month, but since it's upcoming, default should work.\n\n- **user_ratings**: The user said \"top rated\", which implies high user ratings. The function says \"user_ratings (str): Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\". So, the default is 'high', which probably means top rated. I can rely on the default.\n\nFor **find_exhibition**, I need to provide:\n\n- location: \"New York\" (or \"New York, NY\"? I'll use \"New York\" as per user input)\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (since \"modern sculpture\" \u2013 I'll assume \"sculpture\" covers it)\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will use default for upcoming events.\n\n- user_ratings: Not specified, so it will use default 'high', which is what we want for \"top rated\".\n\nThis seems perfect. I can call **find_exhibition** with location and art_form, and let the others default.\n\nThe function call format must be exact: <TOOLCALL><functions><function name=\"find_exhibition\"><params><param name=\"location\" value=\"New York\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"art_form\" value=\"sculpture\" type=\"string\"/></params></function></functions></TOOLCALL>\n\nTypes: location is string, art_form is string.\n\nI don't think I need to call any other functions.

The function might not have a sub-category for \"modern\", so I'll proceed with \"sculpture\".\n\nOnce I make this call, the system will execute it, and if needed, I can follow up, but for now, this seems to complete the task.\n\nMy response should only be the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else."}

The function allows for the deck to be optional, so I don't need to provide it; it will use a standard deck by default.\n\nI need to make a function call in the exact format specified:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n...\n</params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor this, the function name is \"find_card_in_deck\".\n\nParameters:\n- rank: 'Queen', which is a string.\n- suit: 'Hearts', which is a string.\n- deck: Not provided by the user, so I can omit it.\n\nSo, the params should include:\n- name=\"rank\" value=\"Queen\" type=\"string\"\n- name=\"suit\" value=\"Hearts\" type=\"string\"\n\nI should only return the TOOLCALL section and nothing else.\n\nThis seems to fulfill the user's request in one go, so I don't need multiple turns.\n\nFinally, ensure the types are correct: string for both rank and suit."}

However, looking at the example, it shows <params> with params inside.\n\nTo be safe, if there are no parameters to pass, I can omit them or have an empty <params>.\n\nThe example has: <params><param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/></params>\n\nIf no params, perhaps just <params></params> or omit it. But the format seems to require it if there are params.\n\nThe instructions: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of...\"\n\nI think I should include <params> even if empty, but let's assume if there are no params to specify, I can have an empty <params>.\n\nFor this function, since defaults are fine, I'll call it without specifying params.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"poker_probability.full_house\">\n\n<params>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nIs that correct?

This relates to the Hardy-Weinberg Principle.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called \"calculate_genotype_frequency\". Let me check its description:\n\n- Function: calculate_genotype_frequency\n\n  - Args:\n\n    - allele_frequency (float): The frequency of the dominant allele.\n\n    - genotype (str): The genotype which frequency is needed, default is homozygous dominant.\n\nThis matches perfectly. The user wants the frequency of AA, which is the homozygous dominant genotype. So, I can use this function.\n\nParameters needed:\n\n- allele_frequency: 0.3, which is a float.\n\n- genotype: The user specified \"AA genotype\", so I should pass \"AA\" as the genotype string.\n\nThe description says the default is homozygous dominant, which is typically \"AA\", so if I don't specify, it might default to that. But to be precise, I should specify it as \"AA\".\n\nNow, for the function call format, I need to use the exact format specified:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n...\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, the function name is \"calculate_genotype_frequency\".\n\nParams:\n\n- allele_frequency: value=0.3, type=float\n\n- genotype: value=\"AA\", type=string\n\nI need to ensure the types are correct: float for 0.3, string for \"AA\".\n\nThis seems to be all I need for this query. Once I call this function, it should provide the answer.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSince this function directly addresses the question, I can call it now.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY contain the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else."}
