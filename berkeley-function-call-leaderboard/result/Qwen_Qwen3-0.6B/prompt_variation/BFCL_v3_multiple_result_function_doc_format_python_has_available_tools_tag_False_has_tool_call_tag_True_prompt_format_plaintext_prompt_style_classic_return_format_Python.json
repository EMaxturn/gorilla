The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nThe parameters required for calculate_displacement are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, but maybe the user wants two decimal places. \n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention rounding, but the default is 2. Maybe I should include it. So the parameters would be initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5, rounding=2. \n\nI should make sure there are no missing parameters. All required ones are present. So the function call should be calculate_displacement with those values."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going. They mentioned it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas related to motion. Since the object started from rest, initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The formula for constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. But since initial speed is 0, that simplifies to s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Solving for acceleration a gives a = 2s/t\u00b2. Plugging in the numbers: 2*20/(4\u00b2) = 40/16 = 2.5 m/s\u00b2. But wait, the user is asking for the final speed, not acceleration. Oh, right, the question is about the final speed. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_speed_from_rest. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. The default initial_speed is 0. So if the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. So using calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters should give the final speed. \n\nWait, but the user didn't mention initial_speed. Since it's starting from rest, initial_speed is 0. So the function call should include distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. That should compute the final speed correctly. Let me check the parameters again. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). So yes, passing those values should work. \n\nI don't see any other functions needed here. The other function is for acceleration, which isn't required. So the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

The user provided both quantities and temperatures. So I need to use that function. The parameters are all there: quantity1 is 2, temperature1 is 300, quantity2 is 3, temperature2 is 400. \n\nI should check if there's any missing parameters. The function requires all four arguments, and the user provided all four. So the correct call would be to use calculate_final_temperature with those values.

Wait, but the problem says 30 feet by 12 feet. Maybe the wall is 30 feet in one dimension and 12 feet in another. So area is 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.\n\nNow, the coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. So, to find out how many gallons are needed, divide the total area by the coverage rate. That would be 360 / 400 = 0.9 gallons. But wait, maybe they need to round up because you can't have a fraction of a gallon. So 1 gallon would cover 400, which is more than 360.
