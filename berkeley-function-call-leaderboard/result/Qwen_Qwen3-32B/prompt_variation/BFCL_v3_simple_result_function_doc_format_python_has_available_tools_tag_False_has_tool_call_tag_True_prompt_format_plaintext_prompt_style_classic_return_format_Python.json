The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The user provided the height as 150 meters and the initial velocity as zero. The gravity parameter has a default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2, so if it's not provided, it will use that.

For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance.

So I need to call the function with rank='Queen' and suit='Hearts'. The deck parameter is optional, so I can omit it. The function should handle the rest. I'll make sure the parameters are correctly named and in the right order. That's all, no other functions are needed here."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the find_recipe function which takes recipeName and maxCalories. The default maxCalories is 1000, but the user specified less than 500. So I need to set maxCalories to 500. The parameters are recipeName as a string and maxCalories as an integer. I'll call find_recipe with recipeName=\"pasta carbonara\" and maxCalories=500. That should get the right recipe."}
{"id": "simple_380", "result": "<TOOLCALL>[hotel_booking(location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"March 10th, 2023\", preferences=[\"pet friendly\"])]</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 404, "output_token_count": 379, "latency": 7.7336273193359375, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function requires location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences. The user specified location as Manhattan, New York, room_type is single, duration is 3 nights, start_date is March 10th, 2023. The pet-friendly requirement would go into preferences. \n\nWait, the preferences parameter is a list. So I should include \"pet friendly\" in the preferences list. The function's parameters are all there: location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences. Let me make sure the date format is correct. The start_date is given as March 10th, 2023. The function expects a string, so \"2023-03-10\" might be better, but the user wrote it as \"March 10th, 2023\". Maybe the function can handle that format, but sometimes systems prefer YYYY-MM-DD. However, since the user provided it that way, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nSo putting it all together: location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is \"single\", duration is 3, start_date is \"March 10th, 2023\", preferences is [\"pet friendly\"]. \n\nI think that's all. The function should be called with these parameters."}
