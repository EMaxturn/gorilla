So I need to replace {ip} with the provided IP address, 192.120.45.67.\n\nThen, the params parameter is a dictionary of query parameters. The user mentioned the node ID, pod, and fabric. So I need to include those in the params. The node ID is 12, pod is 10, and fabric is Network1. Also, since it's Ethernet interface stats, maybe there's a parameter for interface type or specific interface, but the question doesn't specify a particular interface name.

But since the function's parameters aren't fully detailed, I'll assume that nodeId, podId, and fabricName are sufficient. \n\nSo the function call would be requests.get with the URL and those params.

The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example has {ip} as a placeholder, so I should replace that with the actual IP provided by the user, which is 192.120.45.67.\n\nThe params parameter is a dictionary of query parameters. The user provided several parameters: fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType. These should all be included in the params dict. The function requires that the params are passed as a dictionary, so I need to structure them accordingly.\n\nWait, the function's parameters are url and params. The url should include the base path. Let me check the example again. The example URL is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So replacing {ip} with the user's IP gives 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. \n\nThen, the query parameters would be the ones provided by the user: fabricName=Network1, nodeId=12, podId=10, interfaceType=Ethernet, infoType=Speed. These should be part of the params dictionary. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The function expects the params as a dict, so each key-value pair should be in the dict. The values should be of the correct type. For example, nodeId and podId are integers, but in the params, they can be passed as strings since HTTP parameters are typically strings. However, the function's param type is dict, which can handle both. But the user's input specifies them as integers, so I'll use them as integers in the dict. Wait, but in HTTP requests, query parameters are usually strings. However, the function's parameter for params is a dict, which can have values of any type. But when sent in the request, they'll be converted to strings automatically. So in the function call, I can pass them as integers, and the requests library will handle the conversion.\n\nSo the params would be:\n{\n  \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n  \"nodeId\": 12,\n  \"podId\": 10,\n  \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n  \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n}\n\nPutting it all together, the function call would use the requests.get function with the constructed URL and the params dictionary. I need to make sure that the URL is correctly formatted with the IP address. Also, check if the API version in the URL is correct. The example uses 'sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. The user's API name is \"get information of an interface\", which might correspond to this endpoint. Since the user provided the parameters, it's likely that this is the correct endpoint.\n\nNo other functions are available, so this is the only function needed.

The district_name should be Sankampang, and sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating is 4.5. \n\nWait, the function parameters include service_id, province_id, district_name, sub_district_name, and rating. All of these are optional except service_id and province_id.
