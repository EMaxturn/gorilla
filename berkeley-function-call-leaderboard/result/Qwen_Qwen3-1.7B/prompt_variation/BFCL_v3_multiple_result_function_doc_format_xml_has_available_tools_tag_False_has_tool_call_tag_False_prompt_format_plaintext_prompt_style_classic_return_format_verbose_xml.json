The user wants to calculate the displacement of a car. The initial speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, and the time is 5 seconds. The question mentions straight line motion, so I should use the kinematics function.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_displacement which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters are all required except rounding. The user didn't specify rounding, so maybe I can leave it out or set it to 2 decimals. But the function allows it as optional. So I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. The rounding parameter is optional, so I can omit it. Let me check the parameters again. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, time are required, and rounding is optional. So the function call should include those three parameters. The answer should be the displacement calculated using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Let me compute that: 20*5 + 0.5*10*25 = 100 + 125 = 225 meters. So the function should return 225.0.

The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might show if it's on sale, but the user is asking for the cheapest price. However, the store_price function gives the current price, which could be the cheapest. But maybe there's a sale price that's lower. But the question is about the cheapest selling price, so perhaps the store_price function is the one to use here.\n\nThe parameters required for store_price are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call video_games.store_price with those parameters. The region is optional, but since the user specified United States, I should include it. So the function call would be store_price with those values.

The user is asking to find out the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about finding the final speed.\n\nThe formula that relates distance, initial speed, final speed, and time is: \ndistance = (initial_speed * time) + (0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2). \n\nBut since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So the equation simplifies to distance = 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. \n\nBut the user wants the final speed, which can be found using the formula: \nfinal_speed = initial_speed + acceleration * time. \n\nSince initial_speed is 0, final_speed = acceleration * time. \n\nBut we need to find acceleration first. Using the first equation: 20 = 0.5 * acceleration * (4)^2. \n\nSolving for acceleration: acceleration = (20 * 2) / (4^2) = 40 / 16 = 2.5 m/s\u00b2. \n\nThen final speed is 2.5 * 4 = 10 m/s. \n\nBut the user might want the answer using the provided functions. Let me check the available functions. \n\nThere's a function called kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So the parameters would be distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (integer, optional). So the user's question fits this function. \n\nSo the correct function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, initial_speed 0. \n\nI should make sure that the parameters are correctly set. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds, initial speed is 0. The function should return the final speed. \n\nYes, that's the right approach. So the function call is needed here."}

The formula is (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2) = T_final. So in this case, n1 is 2, T1 is 300, n2 is 3, T2 is 400. Let me check the available functions.

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability.\n\nThe dice_roll_probability function seems relevant here. Let me check its parameters. The required parameters are desired_sum, sides_per_die, and n_rolls. The desired_sum is 7, which is given. The sides_per_die is usually 6 for a standard die, so that's default. The n_rolls is 2 because they're rolling two dice. Wait, the function's parameters: n_rolls is optional and defaults to 1. So even if they roll two dice, the function should handle that. So I need to set desired_sum to 7, sides_per_die to 6 (though maybe it's default, but the function might require it). Wait, the parameters say sides_per_die is required. Oh, right, the required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. Wait, looking back: the parameters for dice_roll_probability are desired_sum (required), n_rolls (optional), and sides_per_die (required). So both desired_sum and sides_per_die are required. So I need to specify both. The user didn't mention the number of sides, but standard dice have 6 sides. So I should set sides_per_die to 6. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, sides_per_die=6, and n_rolls=2. Wait, but n_rolls is optional. The default is 1, but since they're rolling two dice, maybe n_rolls should be 2. But the function's description says \"number of dice to be rolled\", so if they're rolling two dice, n_rolls is 2. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, sides_per_die=6, n_rolls=2. That should calculate the probability correctly. Let me make sure.
