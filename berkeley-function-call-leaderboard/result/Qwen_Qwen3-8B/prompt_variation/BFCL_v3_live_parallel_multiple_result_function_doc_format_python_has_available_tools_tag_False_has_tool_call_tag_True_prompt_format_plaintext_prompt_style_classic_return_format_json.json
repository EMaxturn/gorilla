The user wants to modify both their food and drink orders. \n\nFirst, looking at the food part: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is available for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they specified removing anchovies, maybe that's covered under removeIngredients. So, I'll call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink is for modifying drinks. The args are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should be a dictionary. The user specified \"large hot coffee\" as the drink, but the function might expect the drink ID instead. Wait, the function's description says it's for updating the drink order based on preferences. The parameters are drink_id and new_preferences. So, the drink_id is 123, and new_preferences would include the modifications. The user wants the drink to be a large hot coffee, but maybe the drink ID is already 123, and the preferences are the size, temperature, sweetness, and milk type. So new_preferences could be {\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}. But the exact keys might depend on the system's setup. Since the user didn't specify existing preferences, I'll assume the function can handle these parameters. So call ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences as the specified details.\n\nWait, the function's new_preferences is a dict. The user's request for the drink includes \"large hot coffee\" which might be the drink type, but the function's purpose is to update preferences, not the drink type. Maybe the drink ID 123 is already a coffee, and the user wants to adjust the preferences. So the new_preferences would include size, sweetness, and milk. So the parameters would be drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nSo both functions need to be called. Let me check if all parameters are provided. For ChaFod, foodItem is given, removeIngredients is specified. For ChaDri.change_drink, drink_id is 123, and new_preferences includes the necessary details. I think that's all."}

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the clone_repo function. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents requires the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or the default path. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination is defaulting to '.', so the repo will be in the current directory. So the directory_name for analysis would be '.' or the actual folder name. But the function expects a path relative to the repo root. Maybe the directory_name is just the folder name. Let me assume it's 'nodejs-welcome' unless specified otherwise. But the user didn't mention a specific directory, so maybe the analysis is done on the cloned directory. So I'll use the directory name as the cloned repo's folder.\n\nAfter analysis, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, same as above. Then, create Kubernetes YAMLs with create_kubernetes_yaml_file. The parameters here include directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify custom names, so use defaults for deployment_name and image_name. Replicas and port can default to 1 and 80, service_type to ClusterIP.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git using push_git_changes_to_github. The directory_name is the same as before, commit message and branch can default to 'main' and 'Update changes'.\n\nWait, but the steps mention adding changed files. The push function automatically adds changes, so after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we need to call push_git_changes_to_github. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changes to git\" or \"git add\". However, the push function does git add, so maybe that's covered. But the user's step 3 might be separate from step 4. Let me check the original steps again.\n\nSteps:\n3. add all changed file to git changes \n4. commit / push to repo\n\nSo step 3 is to add changes, step 4 is commit and push. But the push function already does git add, so maybe step 3 is redundant. However, the user might want to explicitly add changes before committing. But according to the functions provided, the push_git_changes_to_github function automatically git adds all changes. So perhaps step 3 is not needed, but the user's instruction says to do both. Maybe the user wants to first add the changes (using git add) and then commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a git add function. The push function does git add, so maybe step 3 is covered by the push function. But the user's steps are separate. Hmm, maybe the user wants to first add the changes (using git add) and then commit and push. But since the push function does git add, perhaps the steps are overlapping. To follow the user's steps exactly, maybe step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is commit and push. However, the functions don't have a separate git add function. So perhaps the push function handles both adding and committing. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to first add the changes (using git add) and then commit and push. But since the functions don't have a git add, the push function does that. So perhaps the steps are meant to be followed as per the functions. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, call push_git_changes_to_github to add, commit, and push. But the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. So I need to make sure that the functions are called correctly."}

The class StringNumberHandler extends AbstractCellHandler and overrides methods like getCellValue, setCellValue, getExcelType, and getDefaultExcelFormat. The error is about the method getNumericValue() not being found in CellResult.\n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to CellResult, including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True. The search_string would be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. I'll need to call this twice, once for each method. For each call, the class_name is AbstractCellHandler, and the method_name is setCellValue and getCellValue respectively. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe include_private should be considered, but the default is False. However, if the methods are private, they might need to be included. But the user hasn't specified that, so stick with default.\n\nWait, the user is extending AbstractCellHandler, so those methods are in that class. The error is about getNumericValue() in CellResult, which might mean that the methods they're overriding are expecting a different return type or parameters. So checking the signatures would help ensure they match.\n\nAlso, the user might need to check if CellResult has getNumericValue, but the error says it's missing. Maybe the user is using a different version of the library or there's a typo.

The unit is cm, but the function might not require the unit in the parameters since it's just a numerical value. So the first function call should be straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but I'm not 100% sure. However, the function's location parameter can take 'City, Country' format. So I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify, so maybe it's okay to leave it out or use the default. \n\nWait, the user might be confused because Queenstown is a real place in New Zealand, but the question mentions Singapore.
