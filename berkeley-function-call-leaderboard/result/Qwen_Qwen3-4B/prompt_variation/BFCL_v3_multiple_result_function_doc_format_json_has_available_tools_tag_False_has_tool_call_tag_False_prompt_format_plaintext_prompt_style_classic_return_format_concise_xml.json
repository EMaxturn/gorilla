The function's default is United States, but since the user explicitly mentions it, including it makes sense. \n\nI don't see any other functions that would help here. The on_sale function checks if a game is on sale, but the user is asking about the cheapest price, which might be on sale. However, the store_price function should return the current price, which would include any sales.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem statement since it starts from rest. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed isn't needed here because it's defaulting to 0. That should give the final speed.

Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of thermal energy. The formula is (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2), where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a 'calculate_final_temperature' function that takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters.

The n_rolls is optional and defaults to 1, but since the user mentioned two dice, maybe that's covered by sides_per_die? Wait, no. Wait, the parameters for dice_roll_probability: n_rolls is the number of dice rolled. Wait, the description says \"number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\". So if the user is rolling two dice, then n_rolls should be 2. But the desired_sum is 7. Wait, but the function's parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls (optional, default 1), and sides_per_die (required). So in this case, the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls is 2. The sides_per_die is 6. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the function's required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. So n_rolls is optional. So the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls is 2.
