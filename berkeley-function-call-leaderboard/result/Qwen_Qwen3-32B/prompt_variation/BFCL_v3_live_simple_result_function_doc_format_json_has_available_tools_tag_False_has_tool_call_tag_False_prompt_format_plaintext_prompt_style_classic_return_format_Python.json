The 'url' should be the base path without query parameters, and 'params' is a dictionary of query parameters.\n\nThe user's parameters include fabricName: Network1, nodeId: 12, podId: 10, interfaceType: Ethernet, infoType: Speed. The function's parameters for the GET request include fabricName (string), nodeId (integer), podId (integer), interfaceType (from enum, which includes 'ethernet'), and infoType (from enum, which includes 'Speed'). \n\nWait, the interfaceType in the function's enum is listed as 'ethernet' (lowercase), but the user provided 'Ethernet' with a capital E. I need to make sure to use the correct enum value. The function's enum for interfaceType is ['gigabitethernet', 'fastethernet', 'ethernet', 'serial'], so 'ethernet' is valid. The user's input is 'Ethernet', but it should be converted to lowercase as per the enum.\n\nSimilarly, the infoType is 'Speed', which matches the enum's 'Speed' (case-sensitive?), but the enum shows 'Speed' as an option, so that's okay.\n\nThe URL needs to be constructed. The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example seems a bit off. Let me check again. The example URL in the parameters is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. But the actual API path might vary based on the version. However, the user is using version 6.3.1, but the function's example doesn't specify the version in the URL path. Maybe the user expects to replace {ip} with the provided IP address.\n\nSo the base URL would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Then, the query parameters are added as per the 'params' dictionary.\n\nPutting it all together, the function call would use requests.get with the url and params. The params should include fabricName='Network1', nodeId=12, podId=10, interfaceType='ethernet' (lowercase), and infoType='Speed'.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The function's parameters for 'params' are a dictionary with the specified properties. So the params would be:\n\n{\n    'fabricName': 'Network1',\n    'nodeId': 12,\n    'podId': 10,\n    'interfaceType': 'ethernet',\n    'infoType': 'Speed'\n}\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is requests.get with the url and these params. The URL is constructed by replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67. The example in the function's parameters shows the URL without query parameters, so the params are passed as the 'params' argument in the requests.get function, which automatically appends them as query parameters.\n\nI think that's all. Let me double-check the parameters and the enum values. Yes, interfaceType is 'ethernet' in lowercase, and infoType is 'Speed' as given. The other parameters are integers where required. So the function call should be correct."}
