Since the question is about displacement, I should use the calculate_displacement function.\n\nChecking the parameters for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. The rounding is optional and defaults to 2 decimals. So I just need to plug those values into the function. No missing parameters here. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed.

The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided. \n\nWait, the region has a default value of United States, but the user explicitly mentioned it, so I should include it. The other functions like store_currency and on_sale don't seem relevant here. The user isn't asking about currency or sales status, just the price.

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, both integers. The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I should call that function with those parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem statement since it starts from rest. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, so even if not provided, it's okay. But the user mentioned it started from rest, so explicitly setting initial_speed=0 might be better, but the function's required parameters are distance and time. So the correct call is calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4). That should give the final speed."}

The question is about mixing gases and finding the final temperature, so the calculate_final_temperature function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_final_temperature: it requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided all these values: quantity1 is 2, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3, and temperature2 is 400 K. All the required parameters are present. \n\nI don't see any missing information here. The function should be called with these values.

Wait, the parameters for dice_roll_probability have 'n_rolls' as optional, defaulting to 1. But the user is rolling two dice, so I need to set n_rolls=2. Also, sides_per_die is required. Assuming standard dice, which have 6 sides. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Let me check the required parameters: desired_sum and sides_per_die are required.

The frequency can be omitted since it's optional and defaults to annually.\n\nAnother function is stock_market_data, but that's for stock market data, not specifically dividends.

The month parameter has a default value, so specifying 'upcoming' might be necessary. Wait, the parameters say the month is a string, and the default is to return upcoming events.
