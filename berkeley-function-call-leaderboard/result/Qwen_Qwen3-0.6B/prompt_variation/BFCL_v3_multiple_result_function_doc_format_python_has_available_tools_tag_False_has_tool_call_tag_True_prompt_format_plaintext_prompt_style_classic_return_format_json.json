The rounding is optional, but maybe the user wants two decimal places. \n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention rounding, but the default is 2. Maybe I should include it. So the parameters would be initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5, rounding=2. \n\nI should make sure there are no missing parameters. All required ones are present.

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going when it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas related to motion. Since the object started from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, and the time is 4 seconds. The formula for constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. But since the object started from rest, u is 0. So the equation simplifies to s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Solving for acceleration a gives a = 2s/t\u00b2. Plugging in the numbers: 2*20/(4\u00b2) = 40/16 = 2.5 m/s\u00b2. But wait, the user is asking for the final speed, not acceleration. Oh, right, the question is about the final speed. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_speed_from_rest. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. The default initial_speed is 0. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed should be 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. So using this function with those parameters should give the final speed. \n\nWait, but the user didn't mention initial_speed. But since it's starting from rest, initial_speed is 0. So the function call would be to calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, and initial_speed 0. That should give the answer."}
