The function requires commands in Korean, specifying room, appliance, and action. The example given in the function's description matches the format the user is using. \n\nFor the first part, \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" should be a command to power on the air conditioner in the living room.

The given URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination is optional, so I can leave it as default. So the first function call should be clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the language. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned to the current directory by default, the directory_name would be 'nodejs-welcome'. So I call that function next.\n\nOnce I know the language (probably Node.js), I need to create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Again, it's 'nodejs-welcome'. Then, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name, and maybe other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. But the user says to base it on the analysis. Since the repo is Node.js, the image name might be something like 'nodejs-welcome:latest' by default. The deployment name could be derived from the directory name. The other parameters like replicas, port, service_type can use defaults unless specified. So I'll call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and let the other parameters default.\n\nAfter modifying files, push the changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs the directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push.

So the final step is to push with these parameters.\n\nWait, the user step 2.1 says create/update Dockerfile based on analysis. The create_a_docker_file function might need to check if it exists, but the function's description says it generates a Dockerfile. So maybe it creates it if it doesn't exist. So I can call that function regardless.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url.\n2. analyse_repo_contents on the directory.\n3. create_a_docker_file in the directory.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name.\n\nI need to make sure the functions are called in order.

The prompt should include all the described elements: masked woman, peacock feathers, cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha style, green lines, complex patterns. I'll set the resolution to default unless specified, but since they mentioned \"digital painting,\" maybe higher quality. But the default resolution is 1280x720, which is okay. Image quality is set to 80 by default, but maybe they want higher? Wait, the parameters for generate_image have image_quality as an int default 80. The user didn't specify, so stick with default unless told otherwise. Also, color_mode is RGB by default, which is fine.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention anything about color mode or resolution, so defaults are safe.

The user wants to find out Shishir's birthday from previous conversations and send a congrats message.\n\nFirst, I need to check how to retrieve past conversations. The available functions include recall_memory_search, which searches prior conversation history. So I should use that with query \"Shishir's birthday\". The function requires a query, page number (default 0), and heartbeat request. Let's start with page 0 and set request_heartbeat to False unless needed.\n\nOnce I get the search results, if there's a match, I can extract the birthday date. Then, use send_message to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir. The send_message function needs the message, recipient, and urgent flag. The recipient here would be Shishir, but the parameter expects an identifier like email. Wait, the user didn't specify Shishir's contact info. The original problem says \"send a message regardless\", but the function requires a recipient. If the previous conversations have Shishir's contact details, maybe the search will include that. But if not, I might not have the recipient parameter. Hmm, but the user is asking to send the message regardless, so maybe they expect that the recipient is known. Alternatively, maybe the system has Shishir's details stored elsewhere. Since the function requires a recipient, I'll have to assume that the search results provide it. So first, do the recall_memory_search for \"Shishir's birthday\", then parse the result to get the date and possibly the recipient. Then send the message. If the search doesn't find anything, maybe the user's request can't be fulfilled, but the user says \"regardless\", so maybe proceed to send the message even without the date? Wait, the user wants to find out the birthday first and then send the message. If the search doesn't find the birthday, then the message can't be sent with the date. But the user says \"regardless\", so maybe they just want to send the message without the date. But the instruction is to first find out the birthday. So if the search doesn't find it, perhaps the function can't proceed. But the user wants to send the message regardless. Hmm, maybe the user wants to send the message even if the birthday isn't found. But the first step is to find it. So the first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\". Then, based on the result, send the message. If the result is found, extract the date and send. If not, maybe send a generic message. But the user says \"regardless\", so maybe send the message even without the date. However, the user's instruction is to first find out the birthday. So the correct approach is to first search, then send. If the search doesn't return the birthday, perhaps the message can't be sent properly, but the user wants it regardless. But without the date, the message is just \"Happy Birthday!\" without the date. The user might want to include the date, but the problem says \"congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\". So maybe the message is just \"Happy Birthday!\" regardless of whether the date is found. Wait, the user says \"find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\". So the first part is to find the birthday, then send the message. If the birthday is found, include it in the message? Or just send the message regardless. The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the message to send is specified as 'Happy Birthday!', so maybe the date isn't part of the message. So regardless of whether the birthday is found, send the message. But why search then? Maybe the user wants to confirm the birthday exists in the history. But the user's instruction is to first find it, then send. So the process is: 1. Search for Shishir's birthday in memory. 2. Send the message. The message itself is fixed as \"Happy Birthday!\". So the send_message function's parameters would be message: \"Happy Birthday!\", recipient: Shishir's contact info. But how to get the recipient? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe the search result includes Shishir's contact info. So the first step is to search for \"Shishir's birthday\" using recall_memory_search. The result might include the birthday date and Shishir's contact details. Then, use that info to send the message. If the search doesn't find anything, then the recipient isn't known, and the function can't be called. But the user says \"regardless\", so maybe proceed to send the message even without knowing the recipient. However, the send_message function requires a recipient. So if the search doesn't find the recipient, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct approach is to first perform the search, then if the recipient is found, send the message. If not, perhaps the user's request can't be fulfilled. But the user says \"regardless\", which might imply that even if the birthday isn't found, send the message. But without the recipient, it's impossible. So the assistant must first search for the birthday and Shishir's contact info. Therefore, the first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\". Then, based on the result, extract the recipient and send the message. Since the user is asking for the function calls, the assistant should first output the recall_memory_search call, then in the next step, if the result is available, output the send_message call. But in this case, the user is asking for the function calls in one go. Wait, the instructions say that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But in this case, the assistant needs to first search to get the necessary parameters (recipient). So the first step is to call recall_memory_search. Then, once the result is obtained, the assistant can call send_message with the recipient from the search result. However, since the assistant is to output the function calls in the current turn, and the user's question is a single request, the assistant must first make the search call, and then in a subsequent turn (if the system allows) make the send call. But according to the problem setup, the assistant should output the function calls needed in the current turn. Since the assistant doesn't have the recipient parameter yet, it can't call send_message yet. Therefore, the correct initial response is to call recall_memory_search with the query \"Shishir's birthday\". Then, once that result is obtained, the next step would be to send the message. But in this case, the user is asking for the function calls in the current turn, so the assistant can only output the first function call (recall_memory_search) and wait for the result before proceeding. Therefore, the answer is to first call recall_memory_search with the appropriate parameters."}

They're having a compilation error in their Java project involving the StringNumberHandler class. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want two things: first, to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository including subdirectories, and second, to get the method signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to check their overrides.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding relevant classes for 'CellResult'. The user mentioned including subdirectories. Looking at the available functions, get_relevant_classes seems appropriate. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive (default false), and include_subdirectories (default false). Since they want to include subdirectories, I need to set include_subdirectories to True. The search_string is 'CellResult'. So the first function call would be get_relevant_classes with those parameters.\n\nNext, the second part: getting the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. For each method, the get_signature function is needed. The parameters are class_name, method_name, and include_private (default false). Since the user is overriding these methods, they might need to check if they're correctly implemented. So two separate calls to get_signature for each method. The class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private can stay as default unless the methods are private, but since they're being overridden, they're likely public. So no need to include private.\n\nI should make sure that the functions are called correctly. The user is working in Java, but the functions don't specify language, so assuming the functions are language-agnostic. Also, the module_name for get_class_info isn't specified here, but since the user is asking about method signatures, maybe the get_signature function is sufficient without needing the module. The functions provided don't require module names unless specified, so it's okay to omit them if they're in the current module.\n\nSo the plan is to first call get_relevant_classes for 'CellResult' with include_subdirectories=True, then call get_signature twice for the two methods in AbstractCellHandler. That should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method found for get_weather(String). They want to know the available methods and properties of the 'Weather' class and the signature of the 'get_weather' method if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to check what functions are available. The get_class_info function can retrieve info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. So I should call that with class_name set to 'Weather'. The include_private parameter is optional and defaults to False, which is fine unless the user wants private methods, but they didn't mention that. The module_name is optional too, so if the Weather class is in the current module, we can omit it.\n\nNext, the user specifically asked for the signature of the 'get_weather' method. The get_signature function requires the class_name, method_name, and include_private. So I'll use class_name 'Weather' and method_name 'get_weather'. Again, include_private is default False unless needed.\n\nWait, but what if the Weather class isn't in the current module? The user didn't specify the module, so maybe the module_name is required. However, the get_class_info function's module_name is optional. If the class is in a different module, the function might not find it. But since the user hasn't provided the module name, I can only assume it's in the current module. If that's not the case, the function might return no info, but that's beyond our control here. We proceed with the given info.\n\nSo the first step is to call get_class_info for 'Weather' to see what methods are available. Then call get_signature for 'get_weather' in the same class. If the method doesn't exist, the second call might return nothing, but that's part of the answer. The user needs to know if the method exists and its signature, or if it's missing.\n\nI should structure the function calls accordingly. First, get_class_info, then get_signature. Both functions are needed to answer the user's question fully."}

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. The parameters required are a and b, both non-negative. Since 36 and 48 are both positive integers, I can use this function. The larger number is 48, but the function's parameters don't specify that a has to be larger than b, but the description mentions a is the first and larger. Wait, the function's Args section says a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So I should pass a as 48 and b as 36? Or does it matter? Wait, GCD is commutative, so the order doesn't affect the result. But the function's parameters might require a to be the larger one. Let me check the function's Args again. The description says a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So I should pass a as 48 and b as 36. But maybe the function handles it regardless. To be safe, I'll pass a as 48 and b as 36.\n\nNow, the second part: the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. That's the derivative of f at x=5. The function provided is estimate_derivative. The parameters needed are function, x, dx (optional), and method (optional). The function argument should be a callable. Since f(x) = x\u00b2, I can represent that as a lambda function or a reference to a function that computes x squared. However, in the context of the user's question, they might not have defined it yet, but the assistant can create a lambda. Wait, the user is asking to use the provided functions. The estimate_derivative function requires the function as an argument. So I need to pass the function f(x) = x\u00b2. Assuming that in the code, this would be represented as a lambda function, like lambda x: x**2. But since the user is not writing code, but the assistant is generating the function calls, I need to structure the parameters correctly. The 'function' parameter here is expecting a callable, so in the JSON, how do I represent that? The user's input is in natural language, so the assistant has to translate that into the appropriate parameters. So for the 'function' argument, the value would be something like \"lambda x: x**2\" or a reference to a predefined function. However, in the context of the provided functions, maybe the user expects that the assistant can generate the correct callable. Since the user is asking about f(x) = x\u00b2, the assistant can pass that as a lambda. Therefore, the parameters for estimate_derivative would be function: (lambda x: x**2), x: 5, and possibly dx and method, which have defaults. So the function call would be estimate_derivative with those parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, the user's question requires two function calls: first math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, then estimate_derivative with function as x squared, x=5. The order is important because the user asks for the HCF first, then the steepness. So the JSON should list the math_gcd call first, then the estimate_derivative call."}

The user wants two things: first, the GCD of 36 and 48, and then the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5.\n\nStarting with the GCD. I remember that the greatest common divisor is the largest number that divides both numbers without a remainder. The math_gcd function is available, which uses the Euclidean algorithm. The parameters needed are two positive integers, a and b. Here, a is 36 and b is 48. Wait, the function's description says a is the first and larger integer. Oh, but 36 is smaller than 48. Does that matter? The Euclidean algorithm works regardless of the order because GCD(a, b) is the same as GCD(b, a). So even if a is smaller, the function should still compute correctly. So I can call math_gcd with a=36 and b=48. Alternatively, maybe the function expects a to be the larger one. Let me check the function's args again. The description says \"a (int): The first and larger positive integer...\" Oh, right, the function expects a to be the larger one. So I should swap them. Wait, but if I pass a=36 and b=48, the Euclidean algorithm would first compute 48 divided by 36, remainder 12, then 36 divided by 12, remainder 0, so GCD is 12. So even if a is smaller, the function might still work, but according to the description, maybe it's intended for a to be larger. To be safe, I should pass a=48 and b=36. But the user provided 36 and 48 in that order. The function's parameters are a and b, but the order might not matter in the calculation. Hmm. Well, the function's code isn't shown, but the Euclidean algorithm works regardless of order. So maybe the function is designed to handle that. So I can proceed with the given numbers as a=36 and b=48. The result should be 12 either way.\n\nNext, estimating the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The estimate_derivative function is available. The parameters needed are function, x, dx (optional, default 0.001), and method (optional, default 'central'). The function argument should be a callable. Since the user provided f(x) = x\u00b2, I can represent that as a lambda function: lambda x: x**2. The x value is 5. The default dx is 0.001, and the default method is 'central', which is probably the central difference method. So the parameters would be function: lambda x: x**2, x:5. So the call would be estimate_derivative with those parameters. The derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x, so at x=5, the exact derivative is 10. The estimate should be close to that, depending on dx and method.\n\nSo the two function calls needed are first math_gcd with a=36 and b=48, then estimate_derivative with the function, x=5. Let me make sure I have the parameters right. For math_gcd, the user's numbers are 36 and 48. For the derivative, the function is x squared, x is 5. The other parameters can use defaults. So the JSON should have two function calls in order."}

The function get_area_of_square requires the size of the side. The user provided 5 cm. The function's parameter is 'size', which should be a float. So I'll use 5.0 as the value. The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention handling units, so I just pass the numerical value. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a location. The example given is 'San Francisco, CA', but the user specified 'Queenstown Singapore'. I need to format the location correctly. Since Singapore is a country, maybe it's 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The function allows formats like 'City, Country', so that should work. The unit parameter defaults to fahrenheit, but since Singapore uses Celsius, maybe I should specify 'celsius' here. Wait, the function's args say unit is a str with default 'fahrenheit'. So I can set unit to 'celsius' for the second function call.\n\nSo two function calls are needed. First, get_area_of_square with size 5.0. Second, get_current_weather with location 'Queenstown, Singapore' and unit 'celsius'. Let me check if all parameters are provided. The user mentioned 5 cm, so size is given.

The image_format has a default, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different format. Since they didn't mention it, I'll stick with the default. Also, keep_original is default True, which means the original is kept. The user didn't mention overwriting, so that's probably okay.\n\nNext, flipping horizontally. The flipImageAction function is there. The flip_direction needs to be 'horizontal'. Again, the user didn't mention any specific image format here, but the flip function doesn't have an image_format parameter. Wait, maybe the image format is handled in the rotation step. Since the functions are applied in sequence, maybe after rotating, the image is in the default format, and then flipping it would use that. The parameters for flipImageAction don't include image format, so maybe it's handled internally. So I just need to call flipImageAction with flip_direction as 'horizontal'.\n\nSo the order of operations: first rotate by 20 degrees, then flip horizontally. The user didn't specify any other parameters, so I'll use the defaults where applicable. So the function calls should be first rotateImageAction with degrees=20, then flipImageAction with flip_direction='horizontal'.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted.

But the parameter is a string, not a list. So no, each call can only fetch one status.\n\nWait, but the user's request says \"all pending and active mandates\". So the user wants mandates that are either pending or active. But the function can't handle multiple statuses. So perhaps the user needs to make two separate calls for each user. So for Parath, two calls (pending and active), same for Bhanu. That's four function calls total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the default is 'active', so if you don't specify, it's active. So for pending, you have to specify. So the user wants both, so for each user, two calls. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call user.mandates for each user with status 'pending' and 'active' each time. So four function calls. Let me structure that in JSON format as per the required output."}
