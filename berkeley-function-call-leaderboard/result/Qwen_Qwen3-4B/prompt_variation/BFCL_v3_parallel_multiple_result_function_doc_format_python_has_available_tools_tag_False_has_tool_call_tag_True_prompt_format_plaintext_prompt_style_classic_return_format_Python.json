The functions provided are animal_population.get_history and animal_population.get_projection. The get_history function retrieves historical population data, requiring country, species, and years. The get_projection function predicts future population, needing country, species, and years into the future.\n\nFor the first part of the query, Bangladesh and India's tiger populations over the last 5 years. The get_history function can handle this. Each country needs a separate call. So, two function calls: one for Bangladesh with country=\"Bangladesh\", species=\"tiger\", years=5, and another for India with country=\"India\", species=\"tiger\", years=5.\n\nNext, the projected population in Nepal and Malaysia for the next 10 years. Here, the get_projection function is needed.

The user wants to use the data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model where x is the 'sales' column and y is 'future_sales'. They also want the residuals calculated and returned.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's data_loading to load the CSV file and linear_regression_fit to perform the regression. \n\nThe data_loading function requires the file_path and an optional delimiter. The user mentioned dataset.csv, so I'll use that as the file path. The delimiter is defaulting to comma, which is standard for CSVs, so that's probably fine.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to call linear_regression_fit. The parameters needed are x and y, which are data['sales'] and data['future_sales']. The user also wants the residuals, so the return_residuals parameter should be set to True.\n\nWait, the linear_regression_fit function's return_residuals argument is a boolean, defaulting to False. So I need to explicitly set it to True to get the residuals. \n\nBut wait, how does the data_loading function structure the data? The user is referring to data['sales'] and data['future_sales'], which implies that after loading, the data is in a dictionary-like structure with columns 'sales' and 'future_sales'. So the data_loading function must return a data structure that allows accessing these columns. The function's description says it loads into a data structure, so I assume it's a DataFrame or similar.\n\nSo the steps are: first load the data using data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv', then pass the relevant columns to linear_regression_fit with x and y set to those columns and return_residuals=True.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The user didn't mention the delimiter, so using the default comma is acceptable. Therefore, the function calls should be:\n\n1. data_loading(file_path='dataset.csv')\n2. linear_regression_fit(x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], return_residuals=True)\n\nBut wait, the data is loaded in the first step, so the second function call would use the data from the first. However, in the function definitions, the parameters for linear_regression_fit are x and y, which are lists. So after loading the data, the code would extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns as lists. But the user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], which suggests that the data is already loaded and accessible as a dictionary with those keys. Therefore, the first function call loads the data, and the second uses that data. However, in the function calls, the parameters for linear_regression_fit would need to reference the data from the first step. But since the functions are called in sequence, the second function would have access to the data from the first. So the correct approach is to first load the data, then call the regression function with the appropriate parameters."}

The available functions are get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nThe get_sculpture_details function requires the museum location and sculpture ID.

But the user is asking for price, which is handled by get_artwork_price. \n\nLooking at get_artwork_price, it needs museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user provided both materials (marble and bronze) and dimensions for each sculpture, along with the museum locations. So I can use this function for each sculpture.\n\nWait, but the function's parameters are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user has provided all these for both sculptures. So I can call get_artwork_price twice: once for Philadelphia's marble statue and once for New York's bronze sculpture. \n\nBut the user is asking for the average price. So I need to get the price of each sculpture and then average them. However, the functions might return individual prices. So I need to call the function for each sculpture and then compute the average. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided sculpture IDs, so maybe the get_sculpture_details is needed first to get the ID? But the get_artwork_price function doesn't require the ID, it uses material and size.

Then, once I have both prices, calculate the average. \n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"average price of a 4 ft x 4 ft... and 6 ft x 3 ft...\". So they might be asking for the average of the two prices. Therefore, I need to make two function calls to get each price and then compute the average. \n\nBut the system here is to make the function calls.

The user has a question involving three parts. First, they need to calculate the total energy from glucose. The problem states that 5 moles of glucose are consumed, and each mole provides 2800 kJ. So I should use the biological.calc_energy function here. The parameters would be mols=5 and substance=\"C6H12O6\". The default for joules_per_mol is 2800, but since it's specified, I'll include it.\n\nNext, the second part is to calculate the biomass using the energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step is needed, and the efficiency is 10% (0.1). The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. So after getting the energy from the first calculation, I'll plug that into this function with efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, the work done by the machine. The work function requires energy and distance. The energy here is the total energy from the glucose, which is the same as the first calculation. The distance is 2 meters. So using physical.calc_work with energy= (value from first step) and distance=2.\n\nWait, but the user mentions \"the total energy produced by the bacteria\" for the work calculation. Wait, the first part's energy is from glucose, but the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%, so the energy available for work would be the biomass energy? Or is the total energy from glucose used directly? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance...\" The total energy produced by the bacteria would be the energy from glucose multiplied by efficiency? Or is the total energy the initial energy from glucose? Wait, the first part says \"total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming the glucose\" which would be the energy calculated in the first step (5 moles * 2800 kJ/mol). But then the conversion efficiency is 10% for biomass. However, the third part says \"total energy produced by the bacteria\" which might refer to the energy available after conversion. Wait, the problem says:\n\nFirst, calculate total energy from glucose (which is 5*2800 = 14000 kJ).\n\nSecond, calculate biomass using that energy and efficiency (10% of 14000 is 1400 kJ biomass).\n\nThird, calculate work done by the machine using the total energy produced by the bacteria. Wait, but the total energy produced by the bacteria would be the biomass energy? Or is it the original energy from glucose? The problem says \"the total energy produced by the bacteria\" which might be the energy that's converted into biomass, which is 1400 kJ. But the machine is using the bacteria's energy, which is the biomass energy. So for the work calculation, the energy is the biomass energy (1400 kJ) and distance 2 meters. But the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance\". So the total energy here is the biomass energy, which is 1400 kJ. Therefore, the work is calculated using that 1400 kJ and 2 meters.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the total energy produced by the bacteria\" which is the energy from glucose (14000 kJ) or the biomass (1400 kJ)? The first part says \"total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming the glucose\" which is 14000 kJ. Then the second part is biomass from that energy. But for the third part, the machine is using the energy produced by the bacteria. If the bacteria's energy is the biomass, then the work is done using the biomass energy. But the problem says \"the total energy produced by the bacteria\" which might be the initial energy from glucose. But the problem's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. However, the first part is about the total energy from glucose, and the second part is biomass. Then the third part is about the work done by the machine, which would use the energy that's available from the bacteria. Since the bacteria's energy is converted into biomass, which is 10% of the glucose energy. So the work would be done using the biomass energy. Therefore, the energy for the work is 1400 kJ. But the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria\", which is the energy from the glucose (14000 kJ) or the biomass (1400 kJ)? The problem says \"the total energy produced by the bacteria\" which is the energy that the bacteria has, which is the biomass. So the work is done using the biomass energy. Therefore, the third step uses the biomass energy (1400 kJ) and distance 2 meters.\n\nBut the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\" So the total energy here is the energy that the bacteria has, which is the biomass energy. Therefore, the third function call would use the biomass energy (from step 2) and distance 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate energy from glucose: calc_energy(mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800)\n2. Calculate biomass: calc_biomass(energy=energy_from_step1, efficiency=0.1)\n3. Calculate work: calc_work(energy=biomass_energy, distance=2)\n\nBut the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria\", which is the energy from step 2 (biomass). Therefore, the third function call uses that energy.\n\nSo the three function calls are:\n\nFirst: biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800.\n\nSecond: biological.calc_biomass with energy= (result from first step), efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird: physical.calc_work with energy= (result from second step), distance=2.\n\nSo the user's question requires three function calls in sequence."}

The principal is $5000, duration is 5 years, annual rate is 4%. The function calc_Simple_Interest requires principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I can call that function with those parameters.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest. The principal is $5000, duration 5 years, annual rate 3.5%, compounded annually. The calc_Compound_Interest function needs principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1. So that's the parameters.\n\nThird option: Future value. The initial investment is $3000, interest rate is 5% (but the function uses decimal, so 0.05?), time is 6 years, compounded twice a year. Wait, the future_value function's interest_rate is a decimal. So 5% is 0.05. The num_compoundings is 2. But wait, the function's time is in years? Wait, the function's description says time is the number of time periods. Wait, the function's parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate (decimal), time (int), num_compoundings. So if the time is 6 years, and compounded twice a year, then the time is 6, and num_compoundings is 2. But wait, the function's time is in years? Or is it the number of periods? Wait, the function's description says \"the number of time periods the money is invested for.\" So if it's compounded twice a year, then each time period is a year, but compounded twice. Wait, maybe the time is in years, and num_compoundings is the number of times per year. So for example, if it's compounded twice a year, then num_compoundings is 2. So for the third option, initial_investment is 3000, interest_rate is 0.05, time is 6, num_compoundings is 2. So the future_value function would be called with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the third option's description says \"annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year.\" So the function future_value is supposed to calculate that. So the parameters are initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2.

The user mentioned that the third option uses the future_value function. So that's correct.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly converted. For example, the annual rate in the first option is 4%, so 4.0, and in the second option 3.5% is 3.5. The third option's rate is 5%, so 0.05. Also, the time for the third option is 6 years, which is an integer. The num_compoundings is 2. So all parameters are present. So the three function calls are correct."}

So I'll set molecule to \"ATP\", organelle to \"mitochondria\", and specific_function to True.\n\nNext, they need the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle this. The origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles, and the unit should be miles. Wait, the default is kilometers, so I must specify unit=\"miles\".\n\nThen, the scientist credited for the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes the discovery as an argument. So discovery should be \"theory of relativity\".\n\nLastly, the current price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function requires brand, model, and finish. Brand is \"Fender\", model is \"Stratocaster\", and finish is \"sunburst\".\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly provided. Let me check each function again. All required parameters are present. No missing info. So I'll call each function in sequence as per the user's request."}

The user has three tasks here. First, modifying a painting's attributes. The original size is 24x36 inches, and they want to change it to 30x40. The medium is changing from acrylic to oil, and the dominant color from blue to red. So I need to call the modify_painting function with these new parameters.\n\nNext, predicting the evolutionary rate for African elephants over 100 years using the Darwin model. The function prediction.evolution requires species, years, and model. The species is \"African elephant\", years is 100, and model is \"Darwin\". So that's the second function call.\n\nThen, calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user says there are 4 possible royal flush outcomes in a 52-card deck. Wait, actually, in a standard deck, there are 4 possible royal flushes (one for each suit). But the total number of possible 5-card hands is 2,598,560. So total_outcomes is 2598560, favorable is 4, and round_to is 3. So that's the third function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, the size is 30x40, medium oil, dominant_color red. For the evolution prediction, species is African elephant, years 100, model Darwin. For the probability, total_outcomes is 2598560, favorable is 4, round_to 3. Let me check if all required parameters are provided. Yes, all functions have their required args. So three tool calls in total."}

First, they want to predict the price of a house in San Francisco. The house details are area 2000 sqft, 4 rooms, built in 1985, located in San Francisco. The predict_house_price function requires area, rooms, year, and location. So I'll need to call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they're interested in lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and state. The entity here is \"Mr. John Doe\", county is \"San Francisco\", and state is California (default). So that's another function call.\n\nThen, there's the lottery probability. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user specified 1000 total, 5 favorable, and round to 3 decimals. So that's the third function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly provided. No missing parameters here. Each function is applicable to part of the query. So three tool calls in total."}

They have four separate requests here, so I need to handle each one individually.\n\nFirst, they want to know the types of fish collectable in 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems appropriate here. The parameters required are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item_type, so I'll set that.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in 'Fortnite' on PlayStation in the Asia region. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. The user provided all three, so I can call that function with those parameters.\n\nThen, they need details on lawsuits involving Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name and year. The case_type is optional, but since they didn't specify, I'll leave it out. So, company_name is 'Apple Inc.' and year is 2018.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability calculation for 10 trials, 3 successes, with a success probability of 0.7. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All parameters are provided here.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called with the correct parameters. Let me check each one again to avoid missing any required fields. All parameters seem to be present. Now, structure each function call in the required format."}
