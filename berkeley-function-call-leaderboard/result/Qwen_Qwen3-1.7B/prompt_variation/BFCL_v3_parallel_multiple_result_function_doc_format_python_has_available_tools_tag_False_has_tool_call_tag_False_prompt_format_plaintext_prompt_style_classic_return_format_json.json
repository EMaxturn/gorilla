So I should call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv' and delimiter=','). That should load the data into a structure.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function takes x and y. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], so I need to extract those columns from the loaded data. But wait, the function's parameters are x and y as lists. So after loading the data, I need to convert the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns into lists. Assuming the data is a DataFrame, I can do something like x = data['sales'].tolist() and y = data['future_sales'].tolist().\n\nThen, the function will fit the model and return residuals.

There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function takes museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The other function gets details like material and size but doesn't mention price.\n\nSo for the first sculpture, Philadelphia, marble, 4x4 feet. I need to call get_artwork_price with those parameters. Similarly, for the second, New York, bronze, 6x3 feet. Each requires a separate call. Then maybe average the two prices. But the functions don't have a function to average, so I can't compute the average directly. But the user asked for the average price, so maybe the functions return the prices, and I can calculate the average from the results. But the user's question is about the average, so I need to call both functions and then compute the average. However, the functions don't have a function to average, so perhaps the answer is the sum of the two prices divided by two. But since the functions don't provide the prices, I can't compute it. Wait, but the user is asking for the average, so maybe the functions return the prices, and I need to call both and then average them. But the problem is that the functions don't have a function to average. So maybe the answer is that the functions can't be used to compute the average, but the user wants the average. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's question is to find the average price. The functions can retrieve the individual prices, but the average would require combining the two. So the steps are: call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, get their prices, then average them. But since the functions don't have a function to average, I can't do that. However, the user might expect that the functions return the prices, and then I can compute the average. But according to the problem statement, the functions are the only tools available. So if the functions return the prices, then I can calculate the average. But the problem is that the functions don't have a function to average. So the answer would be to call both functions and then compute the average. But since the user is asking for the average, and the functions can't compute it, maybe the answer is that the functions can't be used to get the average. But the user might expect that the functions can be used to get the individual prices, and then the average can be calculated. So the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then take the average of the two prices. But since the functions don't have a function to average, the assistant can't do that. However, the user's question is about the average, so the assistant must call the functions and then compute the average. But the assistant can't do that in the current step. Therefore, the answer is to call both functions and then compute the average. But the assistant can only return the function calls. So the correct function calls are for both sculptures. Then, the average would be the sum of the two prices divided by two. But since the assistant can't compute the average, maybe the answer is to call both functions and then state the average. However, the user's question requires the average, so the assistant must provide the function calls. Therefore, the answer is to call get_artwork_price for both sculptures."}

The user has three parts to their question, each involving different calculations.\n\nFirst, they want to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The given energy per mole is 2800 kJ/mol. So, using the biological.calc_energy function, I'll set mols to 5 and substance as glucose. The default joules_per_mol is 2800, so that should work.\n\nNext, they need to find the biomass produced with the energy and 10% efficiency. The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step is the total energy, and efficiency is 10% (so 0.1). That should give the biomass.\n\nThird, the machine needs to move 2 meters. The work done is energy multiplied by distance. But wait, the user mentioned using the total energy from the first step. So, using physical.calc_work with energy from the first step and distance 2 meters. But wait, the energy here is in kJ? The function's parameters don't specify units, but the distance is in meters. The function might handle the units, but the user wants the work done by the machine. So, the third step is straightforward with the energy from the first step and distance 2.\n\nWait, but the first step's energy is in kJ, and the work is in joules. The function might require energy in joules. But the user didn't specify units, so maybe the function handles it. Let me check the parameters. The physical.calc_work has energy as a float, and distance as a float. The default for joules_per_mol is 2800, but that's for the energy function. So, the first step's energy is 5 * 2800 = 14000 kJ, which is 14,000,000 J. Then, the work is 14,000,000 J * 2 m = 28,000,000 J. But the function might just take the energy and distance, so the parameters would be energy=14000000 and distance=2. But the user might expect the answer in kJ or J. However, the function's parameters don't specify units, so the function will handle it. So, the third step is using the energy from the first step and distance 2 meters.\n\nSo, the three function calls would be:\n\n1. biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800.0\n2. biological.calc_biomass with energy (from step 1) and efficiency=0.1\n3. physical.calc_work with energy (from step 1) and distance=2\n\nBut wait, the first step's energy is calculated as 5 * 2800 = 14000 kJ. But the function's parameters for calc_energy have joules_per_mol as default 2800. So, if the user specifies the substance and mols, the function will compute the energy. So, the first call is correct.\n\nThen, the second step uses the energy from the first step and efficiency 0.1 to get biomass. The function's parameters are energy and efficiency, so that's correct.\n\nThird step uses the energy from the first step and distance 2 meters. So, the physical.calc_work function is called with those parameters.\n\nSo, the JSON should have three function calls."}

John has three investment options, and I need to calculate the returns for each using the provided functions. Let me break down each option and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, the first option is a simple interest scheme with a principal of $5000, a duration of 5 years, and an annual rate of 4%. The calc_Simple_Interest function should be used here. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I'll call that function with 5000, 5, and 4.\n\nNext, the second option is compound interest with the same principal of $5000, 5 years, and an annual rate of 3.5%. The calc_Compound_Interest function requires principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it compounds annually, compound_freq is 1. So I'll use that function with 5000, 5, 3.5, and 1.\n\nThird, the third option is an initial investment of $3000 at 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. Here, the principle is 3000, duration is 6, annual_rate is 5, and compound_freq is 2. So I need to call calc_Compound_Interest again with these parameters.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using future_value as well. But the question says to use calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively. Wait, the third option's description mentions future value, but the user wants to calculate returns using the three functions. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe future_value function calculates the future value, which is the same as the compound interest result. But the user wants to use the three functions. However, the third option's description says he can invest $3000 at 5% for 6 years with compounding twice a year. So maybe the future_value function is needed here. But the user's question says to use the three functions. Wait, the first option uses simple interest, the second uses compound interest, and the third uses future value. But the functions available are calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value. So for the third option, maybe the future_value function is needed. But the third option's parameters are different. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe third option's parameters are initial_investment of $3000, annual rate 5%, time 6 years, compound_freq 2. So using future_value with initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2. But the user's question says to use the three functions. Wait, the first option uses calc_Simple_Interest, the second uses calc_Compound_Interest, and the third uses future_value. But the third option's description mentions a third option where he invests $3000, but the user's question says to use the three functions. So maybe the third option is handled by future_value. However, the user might have intended to use calc_Compound_Interest for the third option. But the user's question says to use the three functions. Let me recheck the user's question.\n\nThe user says: \"using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So each option is handled by one of these functions. So the first option (simple interest) uses calc_Simple_Interest, the second (compound interest) uses calc_Compound_Interest, and the third (future value) uses future_value. But the third option's parameters are different. Wait, the third option's description says he invests $3000 at 5% for 6 years with compounding twice a year. So the future_value function would calculate the future value, which is the same as the compound interest result. But the user wants to use the future_value function for this third option. However, the calc_Compound_Interest function is for compound interest, which is the same as future value. But the user's question says to use the three functions. So maybe the third option is handled by future_value. But the user's question says to use the three functions, so perhaps the third option is handled by future_value. But the user's question says to use the three functions, so maybe the third option is handled by future_value. However, the user might have intended to use calc_Compound_Interest for the third option. But the user's instruction says to use the three functions respectively. So I need to make sure each option is assigned to the correct function.\n\nSo, the first option: simple interest \u2192 calc_Simple_Interest.\n\nSecond option: compound interest \u2192 calc_Compound_Interest.\n\nThird option: future value \u2192 future_value.\n\nBut the third option's parameters are initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=5% (so 0.05), time=6, num_compoundings=2. So the future_value function would take initial_investment, interest_rate, time, num_compoundings. So that's correct.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest with 5000, 5, 4.\n\n2. calc_Compound_Interest with 5000, 5, 3.5, 1.\n\n3. future_value with 3000, 0.05, 6, 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should include these three function calls."}

First, they want the function of ATP in the mitochondria with a specific function. The function_lookup function can be used here. The molecule is ATP, organelle is mitochondria, and specific_function is True.\n\nNext, they asked for the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle that. The origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles, and unit is miles.\n\nThen, the user wants who credited the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function with the discovery \"theory of relativity\" should give the answer.\n\nLastly, the retail price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function with brand Fender, model Stratocaster, and finish sunburst.\n\nI need to make sure all functions are called correctly with the right parameters. Let's check each function's required arguments. The first three functions have all necessary parameters. The last one also has the required ones. So, all functions can be called as per the user's request."}

The user has a few tasks here. First, they want to modify the painting's attributes. The original painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant color. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil medium, and red color. So I need to call the modify_painting function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant over 100 years using the Darwin model. The prediction.evolution function is for that. The species is African elephant, years=100, model='Darwin'. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. They want the probability of a royal flush in a 52-card deck, with 4 possible outcomes. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Here, total_outcomes is 52*51*50*48*47*46 (since order matters for a flush?), but wait, the user says 4 possible outcomes for royal flush. Wait, the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user says there are 4 possible outcomes. So favorable_outcomes is 4, and total_outcomes is 52*51*50*48*47*46? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5) which is 2,598,960. But the user is asking about the probability of a royal flush. A royal flush is 4 possible (one for each suit). So the favorable outcomes are 4. The total outcomes are 52C5. So the probability would be 4 / 2,598,960. But the user wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places. So the function calculate_probability would take favorable_outcomes=4 and total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (since that's the number of ways to choose 5 cards, but wait, no. Wait, the total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands. So the total_outcomes is 52C5, which is 2,598,960. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 possible outcomes for royal flush. So the function would need to have total_outcomes as 52*51*50*49*48 (which is the number of possible 5-card hands, but that's not correct. Wait, no. The total number of possible 5-card hands is 52 choose 5, which is 2,598,960. So the function's parameters would be total_outcomes=2598960 and favorable_outcomes=4. But the user says \"there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\" So the function would need to have those values. So the parameters would be total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (but that's not correct). Wait, no. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52C5. So the function's parameters would be total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 / (5*4*3*2*1) = 2,598,960. But the user might not know that, so maybe the function is designed to take the total number of possible outcomes as 52*51*50*49*48 (which is the number of ways to arrange 5 cards, but that's not correct). Wait, the function's description says total_outcomes is the total number of possible outcomes. So if the user is asking for the probability of a royal flush, which is 4 possible (one for each suit), then the favorable_outcomes is 4, and the total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52C5. So the function would need to have total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 / (5*4*3*2*1) = 2,598,960. But the user might not know that, so maybe the function is designed to take the total_outcomes as 52*51*50*49*48 (which is the number of permutations, not combinations). But that's not correct. However, the user's instruction says to use the given functions. So the function calculate_probability requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user says there are 4 possible outcomes for royal flush. So the parameters would be total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (which is 52P5) and favorable_outcomes=4. But that's not correct. Wait, the total number of possible 5-card hands is 52C5, which is 2,598,960. So the function's parameters would be total_outcomes=2598960 and favorable_outcomes=4. So the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=2598960 and favorable_outcomes=4, and round_to=3.\n\nSo putting it all together, the three function calls are:\n\n1. modify_painting with size='30x40', medium='oil', dominant_color='red'.\n2. prediction.evolution with species='African elephant', years=100, model='Darwin'.\n3. calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 / (5*4*3*2*1) (but since the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, maybe the user expects the total_outcomes to be 52*51*50*49*48 (which is 52P5) and favorable_outcomes=4. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 possible outcomes, so favorable_outcomes=4. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52C5. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user might need to input the total_outcomes as 52*51*50*49*48 / (5*4*3*2*1) = 2,598,960. But since the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, the user would need to input those values. However, the user might not know the exact value, but the function can handle it. So the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=2598960 and favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nSo the final answer would be the three function calls."}

The user has three main requests here. First, predicting the house price in San Francisco. Second, finding lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. Third, calculating the lottery probability.\n\nStarting with the house price prediction. The user provided area (2000 sq ft), rooms (4), year (1985), and location (San Francisco). The function predict_house_price requires these parameters. So I'll call that function with those values.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The entity is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco. The function lawsuit_search takes entity, county, and state. The state defaults to California, which is correct here. So I need to call lawsuit_search with entity \"Mr. John Doe\", county \"San Francisco\", and state \"California\".\n\nThen the lottery probability. The user mentioned total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, and wants it rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The round_to is optional, default 2, but here it's 3. So I'll call calculate_probability with those numbers and round_to 3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. For the lawsuit_search, the state is California, which is the default, but including it explicitly might be better. The other functions are straightforward. No missing parameters here.

The game_score.highest function needs game, platform, region. So game is 'Fortnite', platform 'Playstation', region 'Asia'.

The user didn't specify a case type, so I'll use the default 'all'. So company_name 'Apple Inc.', year 2018, case_type 'all'.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability.
