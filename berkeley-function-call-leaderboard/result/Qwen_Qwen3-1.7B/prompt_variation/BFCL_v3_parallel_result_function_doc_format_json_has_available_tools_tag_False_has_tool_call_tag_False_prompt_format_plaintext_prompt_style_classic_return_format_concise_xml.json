The parameters are location (string), movie (array of strings with enum values Tenet and No Time To Die), and time (array of strings for show times).\n\nThe user is asking for two different movies at different times. The function's parameters allow specifying both movies and times. However, the function's 'movie' parameter is an array, so I can include both Tenet and No Time To Die.

Each call will have the location and species parameter. The year is specified for each, but the default is 2000, but the user wants 2015 and 2020, so I have to include those.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nFirst call: ecology.get_turtle_population with location \"Galapagos Islands\", year 2015, species True.\nSecond call: ecology.get_turtle_population with location \"Galapagos Islands\", year 2020, species True.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function's requirements. The species is a boolean, so True is correct. The year is an integer. The location is a string. All required parameters are present. So that's it."}

The user wants to calculate the return on investment for each of the three stocks they mentioned. They bought three stocks at different prices and sold them at different prices, plus received dividends.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available function. The function calculate_return_on_investment takes purchase_price, sale_price, and dividend. The parameters are required except for dividend which has a default of 0. So for each stock, I need to call this function with their respective purchase and sale prices, and the dividends.\n\nFor the first stock: purchase_price $150, sale_price $180, dividend $20. So call the function with these values.\n\nSecond stock: purchase_price $200, sale_price $210, dividend $30. Another function call.\n\nThird stock: purchase_price $250, sale_price $300, dividend $40. Third function call.\n\nEach stock is handled separately. The function should return the ROI for each. The user probably wants each ROI calculated and maybe the total? But the question says \"for each of these stocks,\" so three separate calculations. So I need to make three function calls."}
