The user is asking for an Uber 'Plus' ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and can wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. The first one, uber.ride, requires loc, type, and time. The parameters for loc need to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format. The user provided exactly that: '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA'. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. The time is 10 minutes, which matches the required parameter. \n\nThe second function, uber.ride2, also has loc and type, but the loc format is 'City, State' like 'Berkeley, CA'. However, the user's address includes the street, so maybe that's not suitable. Also, uber.ride2's time has a default of 10, but the user specified 10, so maybe it's okay. But the problem is the loc format. The user's address includes the street, which uber.ride2's loc doesn't account for. So probably, uber.ride is the correct function here. \n\nWait, the description for uber.ride says the loc is in 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided. So uber.ride is the right choice. The parameters are all present: loc, type, time. So the function call should be uber.ride with those parameters."}

They mentioned using the internet with the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' and want the results in text format, up to 10. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's HNA_WQA.search which is for retrieving up-to-date info via web search. The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user specified the keyword as '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format as text, and max_results as 10. The language wasn't mentioned, but the default is EN. Since the user is asking for information in Korean, maybe they want the results in Korean. Wait, the function's language parameter defaults to EN, but the user might prefer Korean. However, the enum for language in HNA_WQA.search includes EN, ES, FR, DE. There's no Korean option. Hmm, but the user's query is in Korean, so maybe they want the results in Korean. But the function doesn't support Korean. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with English results. Since the default is EN, maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the results in Korean, but since the function doesn't have a Korean option, perhaps the default EN is the best possible. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to search using the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' and get text results, max 10. The HNA_WQA.search function can handle that. The parameters needed are keyword, result_format (text), max_results (10). The language is optional, defaulting to EN. So even if the results are in English, it's the best available. So the correct function call would be HNA_WQA.search with keyword='\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format='text', max_results=10. The language parameter can be left as default or set to EN. Since the user didn't specify language, default is EN. So the function call should include those parameters."}

The user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday and wants a congratulatory message sent to him.\n\nFirst, I need to check if I have any existing information about Shishir Patil's birthday. Since the user mentioned using recall memory, I should use the 'recall_memory_search' function to look through past conversations. But wait, the user hasn't provided any previous interaction details here. Maybe the birthday info isn't in the recall memory.\n\nNext, if the birthday isn't found in recall memory, I might need to ask the user for it. But the user's question seems to assume I already know it. Hmm, perhaps the user expects me to have that info stored somewhere else. Let me check the core memory. The core memory has 'human' and 'persona' sections. The 'human' section should have user details, but if Shishir Patil is the user, maybe his birthday is there. However, the initial setup mentions that the 'human' block includes key details about the user. If the user hasn't provided his birthday yet, I can't retrieve it from core memory.\n\nWait, the user might be referring to someone else, not themselves. But the question is phrased as \"send a congratulation message to him,\" implying Shishir is the user. If the birthday isn't in the core or recall memory, I need to prompt the user to provide it. However, the functions available don't include a way to ask the user directly except through 'send_message'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the 'archival_memory_search' to find the birthday. But archival memory is for structured data, and unless it's been inserted before, it won't be there. Since there's no prior insertion mentioned, that's unlikely.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to first search recall memory for any mention of Shishir's birthday. If not found, inform the user that the information isn't available and ask for the birthday. But according to the functions provided, the only way to send a message is via 'send_message'. However, the user's instruction says to send a congratulatory message, which requires knowing the birthday. Without it, I can't proceed. \n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to generate a message regardless, but that's not possible without the date. Therefore, the first step is to check recall memory. If that fails, I need to ask the user for the birthday. But the functions don't allow for an interactive prompt; the only way is to use 'send_message' to ask the user. However, the user's question is a single query, so perhaps the assistant is supposed to handle it by first retrieving the info and then sending the message. \n\nBut given the functions available, the correct steps are: 1. Use 'recall_memory_search' to find Shishir's birthday in conversation history. 2. If found, use 'send_message' with the congratulatory message. 3. If not found, use 'send_message' to ask the user for the birthday. However, the user's question might be testing if I can recognize that the birthday isn't available and handle that. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user is asking to \"send a congratulation message,\" so the assistant must have the birthday info. Since it's not present, the assistant should first retrieve it. Therefore, the first function call should be to 'recall_memory_search' with the query \"Shishir Patil birthday\". If that returns the date, then proceed to send the message. If not, then the assistant can't proceed without additional info. \n\nBut the user's question might be a test case where the birthday is known. However, based on the given functions and no prior data, the assistant must first check recall memory. So the first step is to search recall memory for the birthday."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, account name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant because it's for generating an overview of a bank statement. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date.\n\nThe user provided all these details: bank name is U.S. Bank, account number is 1-523-1713-5704, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The start_date is October 1, 2019, end_date is October 31, 2019. Total deposits are $7,132.76 and withdrawals $5,927.40. They also mentioned beginning and ending balances, but the BankStatementOverView function doesn't require those. However, the transaction_summary.generate function might need them. Wait, the user wants a transaction summary as well. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions (array of individual transactions), starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe they can't use that function directly. However, the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview includes totals, so maybe that's sufficient for the overview. The user might need both the overview and the summary. But since the transaction_summary requires individual transactions, which aren't provided, perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the main one to use here. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned \"include a summary of transactions for this period.\" The BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview includes totals, which might be what they need. The transaction_summary.generate might need more details. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe the BankStatementOverView is the right choice. Let me structure the parameters for BankStatementOverView. The parameters are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these. So I can call BankStatementOverView with those parameters. \n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview is a dict, so in the function call, it should be a nested dict. Let me make sure. The parameters for BankStatementOverView include transaction_overview as a dict with the properties mentioned. So the function call would include that. The user also mentioned the beginning and ending balances, but those aren't part of the BankStatementOverView parameters. However, the transaction_summary.generate function does require starting_balance and ending_balance. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe they can't use that function. So the main function to call is BankStatementOverView with the given data. \n\nSo the correct function call would be BankStatementOverView with the provided details. Let me check if all required parameters are present. Yes, bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview (which includes the totals and dates). The user provided all these. So that's the function to call."}

They want to know the list of movies showing in Noida on the current date. \n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are get_movies, get_show_times, and get_movie_details. The get_movies function seems relevant here because its description says it retrieves a list of movies playing in a specified city and cinema hall, with options to filter by date, language, and format. \n\nThe parameters required for get_movies are city, cinema_hall (optional), movie_date (optional), movie_language (optional), and movie_format (optional). The user provided the city as Noida and mentioned \"today,\" so I need to set the movie_date to today's date in India. Since the system should calculate the current date, I don't need the user to provide it. \n\nThe user didn't specify a cinema hall, so cinema_hall can be left as default (None). They also didn't mention language or format, so those can use their defaults. The default for movie_format is 2D, which is fine. \n\nSo the function call should be get_movies with city set to Noida and movie_date set to today's date. Wait, but how is the current date handled? The user instruction says to consider the current date in India, so the system should automatically use today's date. Therefore, the parameters would be city: 'Noida' and movie_date: 'DD-MM-YYYY' formatted for today. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the date, the system should default it. So the function call would include city as Noida and movie_date as today's date. However, the parameters for get_movies have movie_date with a default of None. Wait, looking back, the parameters for get_movies: movie_date has a default of None. But the user specified \"today,\" so we need to set it. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"today,\" so the function needs to have the current date. But how is that handled? The system is supposed to calculate it. So in the function call, the movie_date should be set to today's date in DD-MM-YYYY format. Let me check the current date. Assuming today is 5th October 2023, the date would be 05-10-2023. But since the actual date isn't provided, the system should generate it. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date set to today's date. Since the user didn't specify cinema hall, language, or format, those can be omitted or set to defaults. \n\nSo the final function call would be get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date=today's date). But how to represent today's date? The user's system should handle that, so in the function parameters, it's passed as a string in the correct format. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to call get_movies with city as Noida and movie_date as today's date. The other parameters can use their defaults."}

Its description says it retrieves the current version information, including name and version number. The parameters required are none, so that's straightforward. \n\nThe user isn't specifying a project name or version, just asking for the version in general. So this function seems perfect. The other functions like get_project_by_name_and_version or get_project_policy_violations_badge1 require parameters like name and version, which the user hasn't provided. \n\nSince the user's question is generic and just wants the current version, I should call get_version. No parameters needed. I don't see any missing parameters here. The other functions aren't applicable because they need more specific info. So the correct call is version_api.VersionApi.get_version with no parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants which searches based on location, category, and other preferences. The parameters include location, category, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors.\n\nThe user specified \"intermediate priced\" which matches the price_range parameter. The enum for price_range includes 'moderate', which I think is the same as intermediate. So I should set price_range to 'moderate'. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, so the location parameter should be 'New York, NY' as per the format. \n\nWait, the location requires the state abbreviation. New York's state abbreviation is NY. So the location is correctly 'New York, NY'. The category isn't specified, but the function requires it. Hmm, the user didn't mention a cuisine type. Maybe the category can be left as a default, but looking at the parameters, category is required. Oh, the function's required parameters are category and location. Since the user didn't specify a category, maybe I need to choose a default or ask for clarification. But the user's question doesn't mention it. Wait, maybe the function allows category to be something else? Wait, no, the enum for category includes options like Mexican, Bistro, etc. But the user didn't specify a cuisine. Wait, maybe the function's category is optional? Wait, no, the required parameters are category and location. So the user's query is missing the category. But the user hasn't provided it. How to handle this?\n\nWait, the user's question says \"find some restaurants\" without specifying a cuisine. But the function requires a category. Maybe the user didn't specify, so perhaps the assistant should proceed without it? But the function requires category. So maybe the assistant needs to make an assumption or point out the missing parameter. However, the user's instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the user's question here is to find restaurants in New York with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Since category is required, but not provided, the function can't be called. Wait, but maybe the category can be left as a default? Looking at the parameters, the category is required, but there's no default mentioned. So the function can't be called without it.

The user wants to book a hotel for studio sessions, starting on the 15th of July and staying for 5 days. First, I need to figure out the check-in date and the length of stay. The user mentioned \"book on the 15th of July\" which I think means check-in is July 15th. Staying for 5 days would mean the stay_length is 5. \n\nLooking at the functions available, the Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function requires place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location, and number_of_rooms. The user didn't specify the location or the hotel name, so I might need to ask for those. But wait, the user might have mentioned the location earlier? Let me check the query again. The user says \"go to the studio sessions\" but doesn't specify the city. Hmm, maybe the location is implied? Or perhaps the user expects me to use the Hotels_4_SearchHotel first to find available hotels. \n\nWait, the user's message is a bit unclear. They mention booking on the 15th of July and staying for 5 days. But they didn't specify the location. The Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function requires location as a mandatory parameter. Since the user hasn't provided the location, I can't proceed with the reservation. I should point out that the location is missing. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the search function first to find hotels in a specific area. But without knowing the location, I can't do that either. \n\nWait, the user might have mentioned the location in a previous message? But in the current query, there's no prior context. So, the user's current message lacks the necessary parameters like location and possibly the number of rooms. The function requires 'location' as a required parameter. So, I need to inform the user that the location is missing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to provide the location but forgot. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to check the required parameters for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel. The required parameters are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, and location. The user provided check_in_date as July 15th (assuming 2023 unless specified), stay_length as 5 days. But location and place_name are missing. The user might not have specified the location, so I need to ask for that. However, the user's instruction says if parameters are missing, point it out. So, the answer should indicate that the location is missing. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Wait, maybe there's a typo here. The user wrote \"2staying\" which might be a mistake. But assuming that's a typo and they meant \"staying for 5 days\". So, the check-in date is July 15th, stay length is 5 days. But location is missing. Therefore, the function call can't be made because location is required. So, the correct response is to point out that the location is missing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the Hotels_4_SearchHotel function first to find available hotels, but that function also requires location. Since the user hasn't provided the location, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the location is missing. \n\nSo, the final answer is to point out that the location is missing. But according to the instructions, if parameters are missing, point it out. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the location is required but not provided."}

Since they're asking what's on, probably FindMovies is the right choice here. \n\nLooking at the parameters for FindMovies: location is required. The user mentioned Danville, but the format needs to be 'City, State'. Wait, Danville is a city, but what state? The user didn't specify. Maybe they assume it's in California? Or maybe the system can handle it without the state? But the function requires the state abbreviation. Hmm, the user might have meant Danville, CA, but since it's not specified, maybe I should proceed with just 'Danville' and see? Or maybe the function can handle it if the state is missing? Wait, the parameters for FindMovies have location as a required field, and the description says to use 'City, State' format. So if the user only provides the city, maybe the function can still work, but it's better to have the state. However, the user didn't mention the state. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville\". Century Theaters are in California, so maybe Danville, CA. But the user didn't specify the state. Should I assume that? Or should I ask for clarification? But the user wants to know what's on, so maybe proceed with the given info. \n\nSo, the location parameter would be 'Danville, CA' assuming California. The theater_name is Century Blackhawk Plaza. The show_type is Imax. So using the FindMovies function with location='Danville, CA', theater_name='Century Blackhawk Plaza', show_type='imax'. That should retrieve the movies showing there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the theater name is part of the location? Wait, the parameters for FindMovies have a theater_name parameter, which is optional. So the user specified Century Blackhawk Plaza as the theater. So including that in the parameters. \n\nSo the function call would be Movies_1_FindMovies with location='Danville, CA', theater_name='Century Blackhawk Plaza', show_type='imax'. \n\nWait, but the user didn't mention the state. If I assume CA, that's okay. But if the actual theater is in another state, that's a problem. But given the context, Century Blackhawk Plaza is in Danville, CA. So proceed with that. \n\nSo the correct function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with those parameters."}

But the user wants songs similar to the album, which might not be the same as the album itself. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to find songs based on the given criteria. If the user wants songs similar to the album, perhaps they want songs by the same artist. But since the user didn't specify the artist, maybe we can't assume. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants songs from the same album, but that's not clear. The user says \"similar to those on the album,\" which could mean songs from the same album or similar in style. However, the function's parameters don't include a genre or other similarity criteria beyond the given ones. So perhaps the best approach is to set the album parameter to 'The New Classic' and the year to 2017. But wait, the album 'The New Classic' was released in 2015, so if the user wants tracks from six years ago (2017), that's conflicting. Wait, the user says \"tracks released around six years ago. This year is 2023.\" So six years ago would be 2017. But the album 'The New Classic' was released in 2015. So the user might want songs from 2017, but also similar to the album. So maybe the function call should include both the album and the year. But the function's parameters allow for multiple criteria. So setting album='The New Classic' and year='2017' would look for songs that are on that album and released in 2017. But that's conflicting because the album was released in 2015. So perhaps the user wants songs similar to the album's style, but released around 2017. In that case, maybe the album parameter should be set to 'dontcare' and the genre should be determined based on the album's genre. However, the user hasn't provided the genre. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle that. But since the user hasn't specified the genre, we can't set it. So the best approach is to set the album parameter to 'The New Classic' and the year to 2017. But that might not be possible because the album was released in 2015. However, the function's parameters don't check for validity, so we proceed. \n\nSo the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic(album='The New Classic', year='2017'). That's the best we can do with the given parameters. The user might need to adjust, but based on the provided functions, this is the correct approach."}

Let me see. First, I need to check which functions are available. The functions provided are Media_3_FindMovies, Media_3_PlayMovie, Music_3_PlayMedia, Music_3_LookupMusic, and Travel_1_FindAttractions.\n\nThe user mentioned \"comic movies,\" so I should focus on the Media_3_FindMovies function since it's related to movies. Let me check the parameters for that function. The required parameter is 'genre', and the enum includes options like 'Comedy', 'Comedy-drama', 'Animation', etc. The user might be referring to comedy movies, so I can use 'Comedy' as the genre. The 'starring' parameter is optional with a default of 'Any', so I don't need to specify an actor unless the user mentions one. Since the user didn't mention any specific actor, I'll leave it as default. \n\nWait, the user said \"comic movies,\" which could be a typo for \"comedy movies.\" But maybe they meant comics, like animated or superhero movies. However, the available genres don't have a 'Comic' category. The closest options are 'Animation' or 'Comedy'. Since 'Comedy' is a genre, I'll go with that. Alternatively, maybe 'Animation' if they meant animated comics. But the user didn't specify, so I should use the most likely option. The function requires the genre, so I need to pick one. Let me check the enum again: the genres include 'Comedy', 'Comedy-drama', 'Animation', etc. Since the user said \"comic movies,\" perhaps they meant animated movies, so 'Animation' might be better. But without more context, it's safer to use 'Comedy' as the genre. Alternatively, maybe the user meant 'comedy' as in humorous movies. \n\nWait, the function's description says it's for exploring movies based on genre and actors. So if the user wants comic movies, maybe they mean movies in the comedy genre. So I'll set genre to 'Comedy'. The function requires the genre, so that's the only parameter needed. So the function call would be Media_3_FindMovies(genre='Comedy'). \n\nAlternatively, if the user meant 'comic' as in superhero or animated, but since 'Animation' is a genre, maybe that's better. But the user didn't specify, so I should use the most direct match. The term 'comic' could be ambiguous, but given the options, 'Comedy' is the closest. So I'll proceed with that."}

Wait, the PlayMedia function requires the track name. So without the track name, the assistant can't call PlayMedia directly. Therefore, the first step is to use LookupMusic to find tracks that match the album, genre, and year. Then, once the tracks are found, the assistant can select one and call PlayMedia.

Wait, but the user might expect the function to calculate the date based on \"this Friday.\" However, the function's parameters don't include a relative date option, only a specific date.

The user mentioned traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1. The category is default 'direct', which is fine. So I can call Buses_3_FindBus with those parameters.

The RequestPayment function is for initiating a payment request, maybe like asking someone for money, while MakePayment is actually sending the money. The user is asking to send $90 to Alice using a debit card, so MakePayment seems more appropriate here.\n\nNow, checking the parameters for Payment_1_MakePayment. The required parameters are payment_method, amount, and receiver. The payment_method can be 'app balance', 'debit card', or 'credit card'. The user specified a debit card, so that's covered. The amount is $90, which is a float. The receiver is Alice. \n\nAlso, there's an optional parameter private_visibility, which defaults to False.

The user wants to book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA on May 15, 2023, starting one day before, with trip protection.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The relevant ones here are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. Since the user is asking to book tickets, not just find them, the GetTrainTickets function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The required parameters are all there except maybe journey_start_time. Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before\" which I think refers to the date. Wait, the date is May 15, 2023, but starting one day before might mean the journey starts on May 14th? Wait, the user says \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Hmm, maybe the start time is one day before the date? That's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, but the start time is one day before, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the date of journey to be May 15th, and the start time is a specific time. But the user didn't specify the exact start time, just \"starting at one day before\". Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the query.\n\nThe user says: \"book ... for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the start time being one day before the date? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14th, but the date is May 15th? That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant the journey starts on May 15th, but the start time is one day before, which is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the date of journey to be May 15th, and the start time is a specific time, but they didn't specify. However, the function requires journey_start_time as a parameter. Since the user hasn't provided the exact start time, maybe I need to check if that's a required parameter. Looking back, the Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function requires journey_start_time as a required parameter. Wait, no, checking the parameters again: the required parameters are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. So journey_start_time is required. But the user hasn't provided it. However, the user mentioned \"starting at one day before\" which might be a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe they meant the date is May 15th, and the start time is a specific time, but since it's not given, perhaps the function can't be called. Wait, but the user might have intended the date to be May 15th, and the start time is not specified. However, the function requires journey_start_time. So this is a problem. But maybe the user made a mistake in the query. Alternatively, perhaps \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date being May 15th, but the journey starts on May 14th. Wait, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, but the start time is one day before the date, which is impossible. This is confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the date of journey to be May 15th, and the start time is a specific time, but they didn't mention it. Since the function requires journey_start_time, but it's not provided, maybe the user's query is missing that parameter. However, the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the start time being one day before the date, which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the user intended the date to be May 14th, but wrote May 15th. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is a specific time, but they didn't specify. In that case, the function can't be called because journey_start_time is required. However, the user might have intended to provide that information but forgot. \n\nBut given the information provided, the user hasn't specified the start time. Therefore, the function call can't be made because the required parameter journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide it but made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date being May 15th, and the start time is 1 day before the date, which is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which is not possible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. \n\nBut since the user is asking to book the tickets, and the function requires journey_start_time, but it's not provided, perhaps the user's query is incomplete. However, the assistant should proceed with the available information. Wait, but the user might have intended to provide the start time but forgot. In that case, the assistant should point out the missing parameter. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the user's instruction also says that if the functions can't be used, point it out. \n\nWait, the user's question is to book the tickets, but the required parameter journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called. However, the user might have intended to provide the start time but didn't. So the assistant should point out that the journey_start_time is missing. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return the function calls if possible. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's instruction says that if the question lacks parameters, point it out. But the assistant's response should only include the function calls. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the assistant's response should only return the function calls. However, the user's instruction says that the assistant should only return the function calls in the response. So if parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But the assistant's response format is to return the function calls. So perhaps the assistant should not include any text, but only the function calls. However, if the parameters are missing, the assistant can't call the function. \n\nIn this case, the user's query is missing the journey_start_time parameter. Therefore, the function can't be called. But the user might have intended to provide it. However, the user's query says \"starting at one day before\" which is ambiguous. Maybe the user meant the date is May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14th, but the date is May 15th. This is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the query and the date is May 15th, and the start time is not specified. Therefore, the function can't be called. \n\nBut the assistant's task is to make the function call if possible. Since the journey_start_time is required and not provided, the assistant can't call the function. Therefore, the answer should point out that the journey_start_time is missing.

But the assistant's response should only include the function calls. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the assistant's response should only return the function calls. So perhaps the assistant should not include any text, but only the function calls. However, if the parameters are missing, the assistant can't make the function call. Therefore, the assistant should not make the function call and instead point out the missing parameter. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return the function calls. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the assistant's response format is to return the function calls. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should not make the function call and instead indicate that the parameters are missing. However, the assistant's response should only include the function calls. \n\nIn this case, since the journey_start_time is required and not provided, the assistant can't make the function call.

Therefore, the assistant should not make the function call and instead point out the missing parameter. However, the user's instruction says that the assistant should only return the function calls. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. But given the problem statement, the assistant should only return the function calls. Therefore, if the parameters are missing, the assistant can't make the function call. Therefore, the answer would be that the function can't be called due to missing parameters. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the assistant's response should only include the function calls. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should not make the function call and instead point out the missing parameter.

Let me check the parameters required. The function allows filtering by province_id, district_name, and availability dates. \n\nBangkok's province_id is 1 as per the enum example. The district is Chatuchak, so I'll set district_name to \"Chatuchak\". The available date is March 22, 2024.

So the function call would be get_service_providers with province_id=1 and service_ids=[2].\n\nI don't need to use view_service_provider_profile here because the user is just searching, not viewing a specific profile. So the correct function call is get_service_providers with the specified parameters."}

The parameters require a token, which the user provided. The function's parameters are a dictionary with 'token' as a required string. \n\nWait, but the user didn't mention specific reminders. The function might need a list of reminders or IDs. Wait, looking back at the parameters for reminders_complete, the parameters section only lists 'token' as required. The properties for reminders_complete show that token is a string. Wait, maybe the function is designed to mark all reminders or there's an implicit way to specify them. But the user's query doesn't mention any specific reminders, just to mark them as completed. \n\nWait, maybe the function requires more parameters. Let me check again. The parameters for reminders_complete are {'type': 'dict', 'required': ['token'], 'properties': {'token': {'type': 'string', ...}}}. So the only required parameter is token. So the user's token is provided, so the function can be called with that. \n\nBut the user's query says \"my reminders\" which might imply multiple, but the function might handle that.

Let me check the available functions to see which ones can help.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions related to retrieving API tokens. There's the 'get_api_tokens' function from the api_token_api.APITokenApi, which requires a user_id and an optional include_expired parameter. Then there's the 'get_shareable_api_tokens' from CustomDashboardsApi, which also needs a user_id and include_expired. The user mentioned they forgot their tokens, so they probably need all tokens associated with their account, including any expired ones. \n\nWait, the default for include_expired in both functions is False. If the user has expired tokens, those functions might not return them unless include_expired is set to True. But the user didn't specify if they want expired tokens. However, since they forgot all tokens, maybe including expired ones would help them recall all. But the functions don't mention retrieving tokens by name or any other identifier, just user_id. \n\nSo, to retrieve all tokens, the user might need to call both functions? Wait, no. Let me check the descriptions again. The 'get_api_tokens' retrieves API tokens associated with the user's account, while 'get_shareable_api_tokens' is for custom dashboards. The user is asking for all API tokens, so maybe both functions are needed? Or perhaps the first one is sufficient. Wait, the 'get_api_tokens' is for the user's account, and 'get_shareable_api_tokens' is for custom dashboards. The user might have tokens from both sources. \n\nBut the user's question is general, so to get all API tokens, including those related to dashboards, maybe both functions should be called. However, the user's ID is provided as \"user123\", which is a string. Wait, in the parameters, the user_id for 'post_api_token' is an integer, but in 'get_api_tokens' and 'get_shareable_api_tokens', the user_id is a string. The user provided \"user123\" as a string, so that's acceptable. \n\nSo, to retrieve all API tokens, the user should call both functions? Or maybe the 'get_api_tokens' is the main one, and 'get_shareable_api_tokens' is for shareable tokens. But the user might need both. However, the user's question is about all API tokens, so perhaps both functions are needed. But the user might not have shareable tokens, but to be thorough, maybe call both. \n\nWait, the user's question is to remind them of all API tokens. So, the functions that can retrieve them are 'get_api_tokens' and 'get_shareable_api_tokens'. Therefore, the correct approach is to call both functions with the user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to True to ensure all tokens, including expired ones, are retrieved. \n\nBut the default for include_expired is False. So, to make sure, the parameters should include include_expired=True. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\nget_api_tokens(user_id=\"user123\", include_expired=True)\nget_shareable_api_tokens(user_id=\"user123\", include_expired=True)\n\nBut wait, the user's ID in the 'post_api_token' is an integer, but in the other functions, it's a string.

The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application alert,\" the create_global_application_alert_config function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for that function: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The name is provided. The alert_type should be 'error_rate' as per the enum. The threshold is 5%, which is a float, so 5.0. Recipients are the two emails given. The enabled parameter is optional with a default of True, so maybe we can include it or leave it out. But the user didn't specify enabling, but the function defaults to True. However, the question says \"set up\" which might imply creating and enabling. But the enable function is separate. Wait, the user didn't mention enabling, just creating. So maybe just create it with enabled=True by default. But the function's enabled parameter has a default of True, so even if we don't include it, it's enabled. But the user might want to ensure it's enabled. However, the question doesn't mention enabling, so maybe just create it. \n\nWait, the function's parameters require name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. All these are provided.

Let me check the parameters again. Yes, the required fields are covered. The threshold is a float, so 5.0. The recipients are an array of strings. The alert_type is in the enum. So that's all. The enable function isn't needed here unless the user wanted to explicitly enable it, but the default is True. So the correct call is to create the config with the given parameters."}

However, the function doesn't specify a way to get all in one call. \n\nWait, the user might not be aware of pagination. The function's default page is 1, and page_size is 20.

But the user might also want revoked tokens. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't have an include_revoked parameter. The first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, has include_revoked. \n\nSo perhaps the user needs to call both functions.

But the get_api_tokens might not require user_id. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for all tokens associated with their account, which could be retrieved via get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user might also need to include revoked tokens, which might be handled by the first function. \n\nBut the user's question is to get all API tokens now. Since the functions might not cover all cases, but based on the given functions, the best approach is to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and page=1, page_size=100 (max).

The parameters for get_api_tokens don't include user_id, so perhaps it's for the current user. \n\nSo the user might need to call both functions to get all possible tokens. \n\nBut the user's question is to get all API tokens now. So the answer would be to call both functions. \n\nBut the user might not have the parameters for the second function.

The available functions are set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for a specific time tomorrow, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for durations like hours or minutes, not specific dates and times.\n\nLooking at the parameters for set_alarm, the required parameter is alarm_time. The user provided \"7:00 AM\" and the date \"2023-12-1\". The function's description says the time can be in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. So I should combine the date and time into one string. The date is 2023-12-1, and the time is 7:00 AM. Converting 7:00 AM to 24-hour format would be 07:00. So the alarm_time should be \"2023-12-1 07:00:00\". \n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, with a default of 'reminder'. The user mentioned a meeting, so maybe setting the purpose to 'meeting' would be more specific. But the default is already 'reminder', which is acceptable. However, the user might want to specify the purpose as 'meeting' for clarity. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for set_alarm have 'purpose' as optional with a default of 'reminder'. The user's request is for a meeting, so changing the purpose to 'meeting' makes sense. \n\nSo the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time set to \"2023-12-1 07:00:00\" and purpose as \"meeting\". \n\nI need to make sure the date and time format is correct. The user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is probably a typo for \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\". Assuming the date is correct, the function should accept that. \n\nAnother thing to check: the alarm_time can also be in 12-hour format with AM/PM. So \"2023-12-1 7:00 AM\" would also work. But the example in the function's description includes '2023-06-01 09:30:00', so using the 24-hour format might be safer. However, the function allows both formats. \n\nTo be safe, I can use the 12-hour format with AM/PM since the user specified \"7:00 AM\". So the alarm_time could be \"2023-12-1 7:00 AM\". \n\nBut the parameters for the function say that the alarm_time can be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', 'HH:MM:SS', 'HH:MM', or 'HH:MM AM/PM'. So including the date and time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM' should be acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time as \"2023-12-1 7:00 AM\" and purpose as \"meeting\". \n\nWait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which might be a typo. But the user might have intended the date as 2023-12-1, so I'll proceed with that. \n\nSo the final function call is set_alarm(alarm_time=\"2023-12-1 7:00 AM\", purpose=\"meeting\")."}
