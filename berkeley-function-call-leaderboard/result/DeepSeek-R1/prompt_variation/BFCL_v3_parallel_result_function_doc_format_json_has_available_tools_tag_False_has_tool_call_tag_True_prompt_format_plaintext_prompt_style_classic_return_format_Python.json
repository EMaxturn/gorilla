However, the description says \"Show time for each movie\".\n Therefore, we must have one time per movie.\n\n Also, the function does not have a parameter for the number of theatres (two) but we can ask for two in the output? \n However, the function description doesn't specify that. We'll call the function with the required parameters and then in the output we can take two theatres.\n\n Since the function does not have a parameter for the number of theatres, we cannot directly ask for two. We'll have to rely on the function to return multiple and then we can pick two.\n\n But note: the function call must be made with the given parameters.\n\n Let's break down:\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]   -> but note: the time format? The example doesn't specify, so we use as given.\n\n However, the problem: the function requires both arrays, but the showtimes are for different movies and we want them at the same theatre? \n Actually, the function is to find theatres that have the movie at the given time. But note: the function does not specify if it can handle multiple movies at once.\n\n The function description: \"Find local movie theatres and their schedule for a specific movie\". It says \"a specific movie\", but the parameter is an array? \n The parameter `movie` is an array of strings (with enum). So it can take multiple movies.\n\n We assume the function can handle multiple movies and return theatres that are showing both movies at the requested times? \n However, the description says \"for a specific movie\" (singular). This is ambiguous.\n\n But the parameters are defined as arrays. So we must pass an array. We'll pass both.\n\n Since the task requires two theatres, we note that the function does not have a parameter to limit the number of results. We'll have to hope it returns multiple.\n\n We'll call the function with:\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n But note: the order of the movies and times? We assume the first time corresponds to the first movie and the second time to the second movie.\n\n However, the function parameters do not specify an ordering. But logically, we must pair by index.\n\n We'll make the call and then in the output we will look for theatres that have:\n   - Tenet at 5 pm\n   - No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\n\n But note: the function might return theatres that have one of the movies at the given time and the other at any time? \n The description is not clear. We have to rely on the function's implementation.\n\n Since we cannot change the function, we call it as required and then in the next step we can process the results to find theatres that have both showings.\n\n However, the current instruction is to only output the function call. So we make the call and then in a subsequent step we can filter.\n\n We are only allowed to output the function call in the required format.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"])]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function requires the parameters to be passed by name and the required ones are present.\n\n However, the function expects `time` to be an array of strings. We are passing two strings.\n\n Let's hope the function can handle two movies and two times.\n\n We are not told that the function can only handle one movie.

Or per month? \n The description does not specify the unit of the result. However, the inputs are monthly, and the duration is in years.\n But note: the function is for California. According to California law, alimony is typically calculated as a monthly amount.\n\n However, the function parameters take monthly incomes and duration in years. We must assume the function returns the monthly alimony amount? \n But the problem says: \"calculate the amount of alimony ... for the next 10 years and 20 years\". This might be interpreted as the total over the period? \n But typically, alimony is stated as a monthly payment. Also, the function might return the monthly amount because the inputs are monthly.\n\n Since the function is not specified, we have to go by the parameters. We are required to pass the duration in years.\n\n We'll call the function for each duration and then we'll see the result.\n\n But note: the problem asks for two separate calculations: one for 10 years and one for 20 years.\n\n Let's break down:\n   First call: duration=10\n   Second call: duration=20\n\n We'll make two separate calls.\n\n However, the function might return a monthly amount. The user's question asks for \"the amount\" for the next 10 years and 20 years. \n It might be ambiguous. But note: the function is designed for California, and in California, the alimony is typically a monthly payment that lasts for the duration.\n\n Since the function does not specify, we will assume that the function returns the monthly alimony amount. Then, for the total over the years, we might need to multiply? \n But wait: the function parameters include duration. Why would duration be needed if it returns a monthly amount? \n\n Actually, in California, the duration of the marriage can affect the formula. But the function parameters are payor_income, recipient_income, and duration (in years). \n So the duration is a factor in the calculation. The function might adjust the monthly payment based on the duration.\n\n The problem does not specify if the user wants the monthly amount or the total. However, the typical way to report alimony is per month.\n\n Since the function's purpose is to calculate the amount of alimony one spouse would have to pay, and the inputs are monthly, it is likely the output is monthly.\n\n But the user says: \"for the next 10 years\" and \"for the next 20 years\". This could be the total amount over 10 years? \n\n However, note the function's description: \"Calculate the amount of alimony\". It does not specify if it's monthly or total. But the parameters are monthly incomes.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we should output the result of the function as is. The function might be designed to return the monthly alimony amount.\n\n Alternatively, the function might return the total alimony over the duration? Then why are incomes monthly? \n\n Without more information, we must use the function as provided.\n\n We'll call the function for 10 years and for 20 years and return the results.\n\n Steps:\n   Call 1: payor_income=10000, recipient_income=3000, duration=10\n   Call 2: payor_income=10000, recipient_income=3000, duration=20\n\n We return two function calls in the same TOOLCALL block.\n\n Format:\n   <TOOLCALL>[alimony_calculator.ca.calculate(payor_income=10000, recipient_income=3000, duration=10), alimony_calculator.ca.calculate(payor_income=10000, recipient_income=3000, duration=20)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function expects integers.

Also, the function description says it gives a combination of primary colors.\n\n Since the user is asking for quantities, but the function does not provide that, we cannot get the quantities from the function.\n\n But we can still get the combination (which colors to mix) for both requests.\n\n We have two separate calls to make:\n   First call: paint_type = \"Watercolor\", color = \"magenta\"\n   Second call: paint_type = \"Acrylic\", color = \"navy\"\n\n However, note that the function expects the paint_type to be one of: \"Watercolor\", \"Oil\", \"Acrylic\".

We have two locations: Berlin and Paris. We can call the function for each location.\n 2. The date: \"next Friday\". We need to compute the date for next Friday. However, note that the function expects a string for the date.\n    Since the current date is not provided, we cannot compute an absolute date. We must note that the function expects a string in a particular format?\n    The description does not specify the format. We have to assume the user input is relative and we must convert to an absolute date.\n\n But note: The system does not allow us to compute without a tool.

But note: the instruction says we are to output only the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\n We are in a bind.\n\n Let me re-read the instruction: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n We are allowed to point it out? But the output format must be only the function call? \n\n However, the instruction also says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. ...

But we don't have a function for that.\n\n Since we are forced to use the given function, we will call it with the string \"next Friday\".\n\n Also note: the user is interested in two cities: Berlin and Paris. We have to make two separate calls? \n The function takes a single location string. We cannot pass an array. So we call the function twice.\n\n Parameters for each call:\n   location: first \"Berlin\", then \"Paris\"\n   date: \"next Friday\" for both\n   genre: \"classical\"\n   amenities: We want parking. The function has a default of ['Parking'], but we want to be explicit? \n        However, the user says \"only in those with available parking\". So we can set amenities to include \"Parking\". \n        Since the default already includes parking, we can omit it? But to be safe, we can set it explicitly.\n\n But note: the function allows an array of amenities. We are only interested in parking? \n The function might return concerts that have parking and possibly others? But we want only those that have parking. \n We are setting amenities to ['Parking'] so that it will return concerts that at least have parking? \n The function description says: \"Amenities preferred at the concert.\" and the default is ['Parking']. \n\n So we can set amenities to ['Parking'].\n\n Therefore, we will make two calls:\n\n 1. For Berlin:\n      location: \"Berlin\"\n      date: \"next Friday\"\n      genre: \"classical\"\n      amenities: [\"Parking\"]   (to be explicit)\n\n 2. For Paris:\n      location: \"Paris\"\n      date: \"next Friday\"\n      genre: \"classical\"\n      amenities: [\"Parking\"]\n\n However, note that the function requires the parameters: location, date, genre. We are providing them.\n\n But wait: the function parameters have a default for amenities. We don't have to provide it? But we want to be explicit about parking.\n\n We can choose to omit amenities? But the user requirement is only those with parking. If we omit, the function will use the default which is parking. \n So it should be the same. But to be safe and clear, we can include it.\n\n However, the function call format must match the required parameters. The required are location, date, genre. Amenities is optional.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])\n   concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])\n\n But note: the function expects the amenities as an array of strings from the enum. We are using \"Parking\", which is in the enum.\n\n However, the problem: the date string might not be accepted.

Actually, we wrote \"Parking\" in the first call? \n Let me check: in the first call I wrote: amenities=[\"Parking\"] -> correct? Actually, I wrote \"Parking\" in the example? \n But in the second call I wrote \"Parking\". We must be consistent.\n\n Correction: we want \"Parking\". So both should be \"Parking\"? No, the enum is \"Parking\". \n\n The enum: ['Parking', 'Food and Beverages', 'VIP Seating', 'Disability Access'] -> the string is \"Parking\"? Wait, it says \"Parking\". \n So we must use \"Parking\".\n\n Therefore, we use amenities=[\"Parking\"]\n\n Let me write the correct function calls.\n\n Important: We must output the function calls in the exact format.\n\n We have two calls. We output them as a list.\n\n However, note that the function might not accept the relative date. But we have no choice.\n\n We output:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"]), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function name is 'concert.find_nearby'. We must use that exact name.\n\n Let me write it again without the typo.\n\n Also note: the parameters are passed as keyword arguments.\n\n Alternatively, we could call the function for one city and then the other? The tool call expects a list of function calls.\n\n We are going to return two function calls.\n\n However, note that the system will execute the functions and return the results. We are not combining the results, but the function is designed to return concerts for one location.\n\n This should be acceptable.\n\n But what if we want to combine the results? The function doesn't support multiple locations. So we have to do two calls.\n\n Therefore, we output two calls."}

Alternatively, we could compute:\n\n        Step 2: h2 = hcf(90,120) \n        Step 3: h3 = hcf(h1, h2)\n\n    This gives the same result because: \n        hcf(a,b,c,d) = hcf( hcf(a,b), hcf(c,d) )  [if we are grouping in pairs]\n\n    However, the problem says: \"use that result (h1) to find the highest common factor with another pair (90,120)\".\n    This could be interpreted as: we are to find the HCF of h1 and the pair (90,120) as a group? \n    But the function doesn't take a group. \n\n    Given the ambiguity, I think the intended meaning is to compute the HCF of the four numbers: 45,60,90,120. \n    And we can do it by either:\n        Method 1: h1 = hcf(45,60); h2 = hcf(90,120); then h3 = hcf(h1, h2)\n        Method 2: h1 = hcf(45,60); h2 = hcf(h1,90); h3 = hcf(h2,120)\n\n    Both methods yield the same result. However, the problem says \"with another pair\", so Method 1 is more natural.\n\n    Similarly for the second part: \n        Step 1: h4 = hcf(36,48)\n        Step 2: h5 = hcf(72,96)\n        Step 3: h6 = hcf(h4, h5)\n\n    But note: the problem says: \"find the highest common factor of that result (h4) with the pair (72,96)\".\n    Again, we can interpret as: \n        Step 2: Compute the HCF of the pair (72,96) -> h5\n        Step 3: Compute the HCF of h4 and h5.\n\n    Therefore, we break the problem into:\n\n    Part 1:\n        Call1: math.hcf(45,60) -> h1\n        Call2: math.hcf(90,120) -> h2\n        Call3: math.hcf(h1, h2) -> h3\n\n    Part 2:\n        Call4: math.hcf(36,48) -> h4\n        Call5: math.hcf(72,96) -> h5\n        Call6: math.hcf(h4, h5) -> h6\n\n    We are required to output the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\n    However, note: the function 'math.hcf' is defined to take two integers. We cannot pass more than two.\n\n    But we have to do step by step because the function only takes two at a time.\n\n    We cannot do nested calls because the tool call format requires each function to be called separately.\n\n    However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n    We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one go? Actually, the instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func1(...), func2(...), ...]</TOOLCALL>\".\n\n    But note: the result of the first function call (h1) is needed for the third call. Similarly, the second call (h2) is needed for the third. So we cannot do all in one go because we don't have the results.\n\n    However, the system is designed to handle multiple turns. We are only to output the function calls for the current turn. Then the system will execute and return the results. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to make the next calls.\n\n    But the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n    How does the system handle multiple turns? We are only to output the function calls for the current turn. Then the system will provide the results and then we (as the assistant) will have a chance to output more function calls in the next turn.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and we are to output in the format of <TOOLCALL>[...]</TOOLCALL>.\n\n    Since we cannot get the results of the first two calls until they are executed, we have to break the process into multiple turns.\n\n    But the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" and we have all the parameters for the first two calls.\n\n    However, the problem is: the entire task cannot be completed in one turn because we have dependencies.\n\n    How to handle?\n\n    We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one turn? The instruction says we can output multiple in the <TOOLCALL> tag. But note: the system will execute them and return the results. However, the third call depends on the results of the first two. So if we output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(45,60), math.hcf(90,120)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    Then we get two results: h1 and h2. Then in the next turn we can do:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(h1, h2)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    Similarly for the second part.\n\n    But note: the problem asks for two independent parts. We can do the first part (the three calls) and then the second part (the next three calls). However, we don't have to wait for the entire first part to complete to start the second? Actually, the second part is independent of the first.\n\n    However, the tool calls in one turn are independent? The instruction doesn't specify if we can chain in one turn. But the format allows multiple function calls in one <TOOLCALL> block. But the system will run them in parallel? Then we cannot use the result of one in the same block.\n\n    Therefore, we must break the process:\n\n    Turn 1: \n        We can only compute the independent first steps of both parts? Actually, the first two calls for part1 and the first two calls for part2 are independent? \n\n    However, the user expects the answers for both parts. But we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the first two calls for part1 and the first two calls for part2? That would be four calls. Then in the next turn, we can compute the two final calls.\n\n    But note: the final call for part1 requires the results of the first two of part1, and similarly for part2.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Turn 1: \n            Call1: math.hcf(45,60) -> h1\n            Call2: math.hcf(90,120) -> h2\n            Call3: math.hcf(36,48) -> h3\n            Call4: math.hcf(72,96) -> h4\n\n        Then Turn 2:\n            Call5: math.hcf(h1, h2) -> h5\n            Call6: math.hcf(h3, h4) -> h6\n\n    This is acceptable because the four calls in the first turn are independent.\n\n    But note: the instruction says \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[...]</TOOLCALL>\".\n\n    So in the first turn, we output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    Then in the next turn, we get the results for h1, h2, h3, h4. Then we can compute:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=h1, number2=h2), math.hcf(number1=h3, number2=h4)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    However, we must note that the system will provide the results of the first four calls and then we (the assistant) will be called again to generate the next tool calls.\n\n    But the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks\". We are allowed to break into multiple turns.\n\n    Alternatively, we could do the first part entirely and then the second? But that would be:\n\n        Turn1: [math.hcf(45,60), math.hcf(90,120)]\n        Turn2: [math.hcf(h1, h2)]\n        Turn3: [math.hcf(36,48), math.hcf(72,96)]\n        Turn4: [math.hcf(h3, h4)]\n\n    That would be four turns. But the problem does not specify an order. We can do both parts in parallel to save turns.\n\n    Therefore, I will choose the two-turn approach:\n\n        Turn1: compute the four base HCFs.\n        Turn2: compute the two final HCFs.\n\n    However, note: the problem asks for two separate chains. We are to return the results for both. \n\n    But the user hasn't asked for the results to be combined. So we should return two separate results.\n\n    Now, let's code the first turn.\n\n    But wait: the instruction says we are to output only the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> block. And we are to output nothing else.\n\n    Therefore, for the first turn, we output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    Then in the next turn, we will get the results for these four. Then we can compute the two final calls.\n\n    However, we must remember which result is for which. We are not allowed to output any text, so we must rely on the order? \n\n    Actually, the system will return the results in the same order as the calls. So:\n\n        result1 = hcf(45,60)\n        result2 = hcf(90,120)\n        result3 = hcf(36,48)\n        result4 = hcf(72,96)\n\n    Then in the next turn, we do:\n\n        h5 = hcf(result1, result2)\n        h6 = hcf(result3, result4)\n\n    So the second turn:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=result1, number2=result2), math.hcf(number1=result3, number2=result4)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    But how do we refer to the results? The system will provide the results in the context of the next turn. We don't have variable names. We have to use the actual values? \n\n    Actually, the system will not provide the actual values in the next turn? The instruction does not specify the format of the next input. But in practice, the system will give us the results of the tool calls.\n\n    However, in the next turn, we will have the results of the previous tool calls. We can refer to them by their order? \n\n    But note: the instruction says we are to output the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> block. We cannot use variables. We must use the actual values that we get from the previous results? \n\n    How does the system pass the results? We are not told. So we must assume that we are to use the results as they are provided.\n\n    Alternatively, the system might provide the results in a structured way. But since we are not given the format, we must rely on the fact that we will have the numerical results.\n\n    However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n\n    In the second turn, we will have the results from the first turn. We can use them as parameters. But we cannot refer to them by name because we don't have variable binding.\n\n    How can we do? \n\n    Actually, the system might not be designed for multi-turn function chaining? The problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". So we are expected to break the process.\n\n    But the system must provide the results of the previous function calls to the assistant in the next turn. How? \n\n    We are not given the details. Therefore, I must assume that in the next turn, we will be provided with the results. And we can then use those results as numbers in the parameters.\n\n    However, we cannot know the exact numbers until we compute them. So we must design the second turn based on the results we get.\n\n    But the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and we are not allowed to output any other text.\n\n    How can we pass the results from the first turn to the second turn? \n\n    We cannot. Therefore, the system must handle the state. \n\n    Alternatively, the instruction might allow us to do:\n\n        Turn1: \n            <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(45,60)]</TOOLCALL>   -> we get h1\n        Turn2: \n            <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(90,120)]</TOOLCALL>   -> we get h2\n        Turn3:\n            <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(h1, h2)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    But that would be inefficient and take many turns.\n\n    Given the ambiguity, I think we are allowed to output multiple independent function calls in one turn. And the system will run them and return all the results. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to call again.\n\n    Therefore, I will output the four base calls in the first turn.\n\n    But note: the user's question is given in one turn. We are to respond with the first set of function calls.\n\n    So for the first turn, we do:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    Then, in the next turn, the system will give us the results for these four. Then we can compute the two final calls.\n\n    But we must output the function calls for the second turn when we get the chance.\n\n    However, we are only to output the function calls for the current turn. So in the first turn, we output the above.\n\n    Then the system will run the four and then present the results to us in the next turn. Then we output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=result1, number2=result2), math.hcf(number1=result3, number2=result4)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n    But how do we get the values of result1, result2, etc.? \n\n    We are not told the format of the next input. But the system will provide the results. We can assume that in the next turn, we are given:\n\n        [result1, result2, result3, result4]\n\n    Then we can use these numbers.\n\n    However, we don't know the actual numbers until they are computed. So we cannot hardcode.\n\n    Therefore, we must rely on the system to pass the results. And we are to use the results as the parameters.\n\n    But the instruction does not specify how we are to use the results. We are not allowed to output anything other than the function calls. \n\n    This is a challenge.\n\n    Alternatively, the system might be designed to let us see the previous results. Then in the second turn, we can write:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=15, number2=30), ...]   # if the results were 15 and 30\n\n    But we don't know the results until the system runs the functions.\n\n    Therefore, we must break the process and do one step at a time? \n\n    Given the constraints, perhaps the intended design is to do one function call per turn? \n\n    But the problem asks for multiple independent calculations. \n\n    Considering the ambiguity, I think we are allowed to output multiple independent function calls in one turn. Then the system returns multiple results. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to call again.\n\n    And the system will provide the results as a list. Then we can refer to them by index? \n\n    But the instruction doesn't say. \n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Turn1: \n            Call1: math.hcf(45,60) -> result1\n        Turn2:\n            Call2: math.hcf(90,120) -> result2\n        Turn3:\n            Call3: math.hcf(result1, result2) -> result3\n        Turn4:\n            Call4: math.hcf(36,48) -> result4\n        Turn5:\n            Call5: math.hcf(72,96) -> result5\n        Turn6:\n            Call6: math.hcf(result4, result5) -> result6\n\n    That would be six turns. \n\n    But the user might be impatient. And the problem says \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks\". \n\n    Given that we can do independent calls in parallel, I think it's better to do as many independent calls as possible in one turn.\n\n    Therefore, I will do the four base calls in the first turn. \n\n    But note: the system might not support multiple function calls in one turn. The instruction says \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s)\" (plural) and the format allows multiple.\n\n    So I will output the four calls in the first turn.\n\n    If the system does not support multiple function calls, it will fail. But the instruction seems to allow it.\n\n    Let's proceed.\n\n    However, the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n    We are not in either situation.\n\n    Therefore, for the first turn, we output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>[math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]</TOOLCALL>"}

We have to make two separate calls.\n\n We can call the function for 2015 and then for 2020.\n\n Since the function call format requires one call per set of parameters, we will make two tool calls.\n\n Let's structure the tool calls:\n\n First call: \n   function: ecology.get_turtle_population\n   parameters: \n        location: \"Galapagos Islands\"\n        year: 2015\n        species: True\n\n Second call:\n   function: ecology.get_turtle_population\n   parameters:\n        location: \"Galapagos Islands\"\n        year: 2020\n        species: True\n\n We put both in one <TOOLCALL> block as a list.\n\n Note: The function name is 'ecology.get_turtle_population' (exactly as given, including the module).\n\n Format: \n   <TOOLCALL>[func1(params), func2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function name must be exactly as provided. The function in the list is named 'ecology.get_turtle_population' (with an 'a' in population? Let me check: the provided function name is 'ecology.get_turtle_population'? Actually, in the provided function list, it's written as 'ecology.get_turtle_population'? Wait, the original function name in the JSON is: 'ecology.get_turtle_population'? \n\n Looking back: \n   [{'name': 'ecology.get_turtle_population', ...}]\n\n So the name is 'ecology.get_turtle_population'.\n\n Therefore, we use that exact string.\n\n Let me write the two calls:\n\n First call: \n   ecology.get_turtle_population(location=\"Galapagos Islands\", year=2015, species=True)\n\n Second call:\n   ecology.get_turtle_population(location=\"Galapagos Islands\", year=2020, species=True)\n\n We put them in a list inside the TOOLCALL tag.\n\n Important: The parameters must be passed by keyword.\n\n Since the function expects the parameters by name, we do so.\n\n Therefore, the entire TOOLCALL block will be:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[ecology.get_turtle_population(location=\"Galapagos Islands\", year=2015, species=True), ecology.get_turtle_population(location=\"Galapagos Islands\", year=2020, species=True)]</TOOLCALL>"}
