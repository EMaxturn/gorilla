The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The given parameters are initial speed of 20 m/s, acceleration of 10 m/s\u00b2, and time of 5 seconds. The function needed here is kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check the parameters required for that function. The function requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. All the necessary parameters are provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional and defaults to 2, which is acceptable. So I should call the calculate_displacement function with these values. No missing parameters, so the tool call should be straightforward."}

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price, I should use store_price. The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided, so I can call store_price with these values. The other functions don't relate to price directly, so they aren't needed here. I don't see any missing parameters, so the function call should work."}

So I need to call the geometry_rectangle.calculate function with these parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here. \n\nI should make sure that the parameters are correctly assigned.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I can use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That should give the final speed.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they are the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of thermal energy. The total heat before mixing should equal the total heat after mixing.\n\nThe formula is: (quantity1 * temperature1) + (quantity2 * temperature2) = (quantity1 + quantity2) * temperature_final.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (2 * 300) + (3 * 400) = (2 + 3) * T_final. \n\nCalculating the left side: 600 + 1200 = 1800. Then 1800 divided by 5 (since 2+3=5) gives 360 K. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's a calculate_final_temperature function that takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters. So I should call that function with the given values. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info here. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed here because the question is about temperature, not mass.

The function will sort the elements in ascending order by default, but specifying it explicitly here is safe. \n\nI don't see any other functions needed here.

So I need to call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7 and n_rolls=2. Wait, the sides_per_die might need to be specified if it's not 6.

The find_exhibition function seems relevant here because it's about locating exhibitions based on location, art form, and other criteria.
