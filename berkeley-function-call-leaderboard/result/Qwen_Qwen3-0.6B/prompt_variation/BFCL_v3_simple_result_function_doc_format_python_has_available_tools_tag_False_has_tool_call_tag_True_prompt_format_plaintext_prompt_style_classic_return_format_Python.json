The default for die_sides is 6, which matches the question's context. \n\nSo, the user wants two rolls of the same number. The desired_number is 6, number_of_rolls is 2.

Let me check the available functions. There's a currency_conversion.convert function. The parameters needed are amount, from_currency, and to_currency. The amount here is 150, from_currency is Euros, and to_currency is Canadian dollars. I need to make sure the currencies are in the correct format, like \"EUR\" for Euros and \"CAD\" for Canadian dollars. The function requires these three parameters, so I can call it with those values. No missing parameters, so the function call should be straightforward."}
