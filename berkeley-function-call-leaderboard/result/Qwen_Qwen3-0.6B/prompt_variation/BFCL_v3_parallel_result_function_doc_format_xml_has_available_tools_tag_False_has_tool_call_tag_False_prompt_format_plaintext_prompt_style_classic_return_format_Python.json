Wait, the function's parameters only have color and paint_type. The quantity might be inferred or not included. The user didn't mention quantities, so maybe the function doesn't require them. But the problem says to provide the quantity for each color. Wait, the function's parameters don't have quantity. So maybe the user expects that the function can handle that, or perhaps the quantity is not required. \n\nSimilarly, for navy using acrylic paint. The function needs paint_type=\"Acrylic\" and color=\"navy\". Again, quantity isn't specified. \n\nSince the user's question includes both colors and both paint types, but the function doesn't require quantities, maybe the answer is to call the function once for each color and paint type.

Then, the third pair is 36 and 48, which has an HCF of 12. Now, the user wants the HCF of 15 and 30 with 72 and 96. Let me calculate that.
