The user wants to find a Queen of Hearts in the deck. The function provided is find_card_in_deck. The parameters needed are rank, suit, and optionally deck. The user specified rank as 'Queen' and suit as 'Hearts'. The deck isn't mentioned, so I should assume a standard 52-card deck. So I need to call the function with rank 'Queen', suit 'Hearts', and deck as the default standard deck. Wait, the function's deck parameter is an array, but if not provided, it uses a standard deck. So the parameters would be rank: 'Queen', suit: 'Hearts', and deck: [] (since it's optional and not provided). But the function's description says if not provided, it's a standard deck. So the call should include rank and suit, and omit deck. So the JSON should have the function name and the parameters with rank and suit."}

The maxCalories should be less than 500, so I'll set maxCalories to 499. The function needs the recipeName parameter, which is provided. The maxCalories is optional but necessary here to filter the results. So I'll call find_recipe with recipeName \"pasta carbonara\" and maxCalories 499."}
