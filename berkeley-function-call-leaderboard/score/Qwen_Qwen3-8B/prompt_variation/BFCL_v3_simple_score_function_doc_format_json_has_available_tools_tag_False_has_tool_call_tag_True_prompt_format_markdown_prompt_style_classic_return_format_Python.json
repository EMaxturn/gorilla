The user wants to calculate the final velocity of an object falling from a 150-meter building with an initial velocity of zero. I remember there's a function called calculate_final_velocity that does this. Let me check the parameters. The function requires height, which is given as 150 meters. The initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, which matches the user's assumption. Gravity has a default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2. Since the user didn't specify any different gravity, I can use the default. So I just need to call the function with height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Wait, but initial_velocity is optional, so maybe even omitting it would work. But the user explicitly said initial velocity is zero, so including it makes it clear. Alright, the function call should be calculate_final_velocity with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. But since gravity is optional, maybe it's better to include it just in case. Wait, the parameters show that grav", "possible_answer": [{"calculate_final_velocity": {"height": [150], "initial_velocity": [0, ""], "gravity": [9.81, ""]}}]}
