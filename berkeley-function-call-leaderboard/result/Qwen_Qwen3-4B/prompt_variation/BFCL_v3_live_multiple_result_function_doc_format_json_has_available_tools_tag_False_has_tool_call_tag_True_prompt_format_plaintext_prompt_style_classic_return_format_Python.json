The user needs an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. Looking at the functions provided, there's 'uber.ride' and 'uber.ride2'. \n\nFirst, check the parameters required for each. The 'uber.ride' function requires 'loc', 'type', and 'time'. The 'uber.ride2' requires 'loc' and 'type', with 'time' having a default of 10.\n\nThe user provided the location as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits the 'loc' parameter for both functions. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum list. The time is 10 minutes, which is the default for 'uber.ride2' but explicitly provided here.\n\nSince the user specified all three parameters (loc, type, time), the 'uber.ride' function is the correct one to use. The 'uber.ride2' might not need the time since it's optional with a default, but since the user specified 10, it's better to use the function that requires all three to ensure accuracy. Wait, no, the 'uber.ride' requires 'time' as a required parameter, while 'uber.ride2' has 'time' as optional with a default. So, the user's input includes all necessary parameters for 'uber.ride', so that's the one to call. Alternatively, maybe the user's request can be handled by either, but since 'uber.ride' is the one that requires all three, and the user provided all, that's the right choice. So the correct function call is 'uber.ride' with loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='plus', time=10."}

The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user has provided the keyword, and they want text format, which is the default for HNA_WQA. The max_results is 10, which is also the default there. So I just need to call HNA_WQA.search with the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', and the other parameters can use their defaults.

The user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday and wants a congratulatory message sent to him. First, I need to figure out how to get Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include recalling memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user hasn't provided any specific information about Shishir Patil's birthday in the conversation history, I should check the recall memory first. \n\nThe 'recall_memory_search' function can search the conversation history for the query. So I'll use that to see if there's any previous mention of Shishir Patil's birthday. If it's not found there, maybe check the core memory. The core memory has 'human' and 'persona' sections. The 'human' section might have user details, but since the user hasn't provided that info, maybe it's not there. Then, the archival memory might have some stored data. But since the user hasn't mentioned anything about Shishir Patil before, perhaps the birthday isn't in any of these memories.\n\nWait, the user is asking for a birthday message, so maybe the birthday is new information. But the functions don't include a way to look up real-world data like birthdays. The available functions are limited to the system's stored data. So if the system doesn't have Shishir Patil's birthday in any of the memory sections, I can't retrieve it. \n\nIn that case, I need to inform the user that the birthday isn't available in the system's memory. But the user might expect me to know it. Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can use the functions to find it. Since the functions don't allow external data retrieval, I can't. So the correct approach is to check the recall memory first. If not found, then proceed to inform the user that the birthday isn't in the system's records. Then, since the user wants a message, maybe use the send_message function with a default recipient, but the user specified Shishir Patil, so I need to make sure the recipient is correct. However, the user didn't provide the recipient's contact info, so maybe use the default. But the user might have intended to send it to Shishir Patil, so perhaps the recipient is 'shishir.patil@example.com' or similar. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the default is used. \n\nWait, the send_message function has a 'recipient' parameter with a default of 'default@example.com'. So if the user wants to send it to Shishir Patil, but the system doesn't have his contact info, maybe the function can't be used. But the user is asking to send a message, so perhaps the system should proceed with the default recipient. However, the user might have intended to send it to Shishir Patil, but without the contact info, it's impossible. So the correct response is to inform the user that the birthday isn't found and that the message can't be sent without the recipient's contact details. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to generate a message and send it, but the birthday info is missing. \n\nSo the steps are: first, check recall memory for Shishir Patil's birthday. If not found, check core memory (human section). If not found, then proceed to inform the user that the birthday isn't available. Then, since the user wants a message, but the recipient's info isn't provided, maybe the assistant can't send it. But the user might have intended to send it to Shishir Patil, so perhaps the assistant should use the send_message function with the recipient as 'shishir.patil@example.com' even if it's a guess. However, the function requires the recipient to be in the specified format. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might not have the necessary info to send the message, so it should inform the user that the birthday isn't found and that the message can't be sent without the recipient's details. But the user's query is to send a message, so maybe the assistant should proceed to send a message using the default recipient, even if it's not Shishir Patil. But that's not correct. \n\nWait, the user's query is to send a congratulatory message to Shishir Patil. So the assistant needs to know the recipient's contact info. Since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant can't send the message. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the birthday isn't found in the system's memory and that the message can't be sent without the recipient's contact details. \n\nBut the user might be expecting the assistant to use the send_message function with the default recipient. However, the default is 'default@example.com', which is not Shishir Patil. So the assistant can't send the message to the correct person. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the birthday isn't available and that the message can't be sent without the recipient's contact info. \n\nSo the function calls would be: first, use recall_memory_search to check for the birthday. If not found, then inform the user. Then, if the user still wants to send a message, but without the recipient's info, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer is that the birthday isn't found and the message can't be sent."}

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the period October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is given, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview needs total deposits, total withdrawals, start and end dates. The user has provided all these: total deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40, start date October 1, 2019, end date October 31, 2019. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview is a dictionary with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So I need to structure that. Also, the starting_balance and ending_balance are provided, but the function parameters don't include those. However, the user mentioned they want the overview to include the balances, so maybe the function's transaction_overview includes those? Wait, looking back, the transaction_overview in BankStatementOverView has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The starting and ending balances are part of the parameters for the function? Wait, no. The parameters for BankStatementOverView are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview is a dict with the totals and dates. The starting and ending balances are part of the transaction_overview? Or are they separate? Wait, the function's parameters for transaction_overview don't include the balances. The user's question includes starting and ending balances, but the function might not require them. However, the user wants the overview to include those, so maybe the function's transaction_overview is supposed to include them? Wait, looking at the function definition again: the transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The starting and ending balances are not part of that. But the user provided those, so maybe they need to be included in the transaction_overview? Or perhaps the function's parameters don't require them, but the user wants them in the overview. Hmm, maybe the function's transaction_overview is just the totals and dates, and the starting and ending balances are part of the account info. But the user's question says they want the overview to include the balances. \n\nWait, the user's request says: \"provide an overview of my business checking account... beginning balance was $5,532.01, and the ending balance was $6,737.37. There were other deposits... and withdrawals...\" So the overview should include those balances. However, the BankStatementOverView function's parameters don't have starting_balance or ending_balance. The function's parameters are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So maybe the starting and ending balances are not part of the transaction_overview but are part of the account info. But the user wants them included in the overview. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's transaction_overview is supposed to include those balances. But according to the function definition, the transaction_overview only includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So perhaps the starting and ending balances are not part of the transaction_overview. Therefore, the user's request might need to be addressed by using the BankStatementOverView function with the given parameters, and the balances might be part of the account info. However, the user is asking for the overview to include those balances. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's transaction_overview is supposed to include those balances. But according to the function's parameters, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the user's request can't be fully satisfied with the available functions. But the user is asking for the overview to include the balances, so maybe the function's transaction_overview is supposed to include those. But according to the function's definition, it's not. Therefore, maybe the function is not sufficient. However, the user might have to proceed with the available parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a summary that includes the balances. But according to the function's parameters, the transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So the starting and ending balances are not part of that. Therefore, the user's request for the overview to include those balances might not be possible with this function. However, the user might have to proceed with the available parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's parameters are not fully specified, but the user is expected to use the available functions. So, the BankStatementOverView function is the one to use here. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all of these. The starting and ending balances are not part of the transaction_overview, but the user wants them in the overview. However, the function might not include them. Therefore, the user's request might not be fully satisfied, but the available function is the only one that can generate the overview. \n\nSo, the steps would be to call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters. The transaction_overview would include the total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user's starting and ending balances are not part of the transaction_overview, but the function's description says it provides an overview including account info and transaction summary. Maybe the account info includes the balances. \n\nTherefore, the function call would be:\n\nBankStatementOverView(\n    bank_name=\"U.S. Bank\",\n    account_number=\"1-523-1713-5704\",\n    account_type=\"checking\",\n    full_name=\"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\",\n    transaction_overview={\n        \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n        \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40,\n        \"start_date\": \"2019-10-01\",\n        \"end_date\": \"2019-10-31\"\n    }\n)\n\nBut the user also mentioned the starting and ending balances. However, the function's parameters don't include those. So maybe the function's transaction_overview is supposed to include those, but according to the function's definition, it's not. Therefore, the user's request might not be fully addressed, but the available function is the only one that can generate the overview. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's transaction_overview is a summary that includes the balances. But according to the function's parameters, it's not. Therefore, the assistant should proceed with the available function, even if the balances are not included. However, the user's question explicitly mentions the balances, so perhaps the function is not sufficient. But given the available functions, this is the only one that can be used. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. The user might need to be informed that the balances are not part of the transaction_overview, but the function's description says it provides an overview including account information. So maybe the account info includes the balances. Therefore, the function call is correct."}

They want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The category isn't specified, so maybe I can leave it out since it's a required parameter?

Looking back, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have category as required, but the default is not set.

So the user wants to specify price_range as 'moderate' (intermediate), location as 'New York, NY', and has_seating_outdoors as True. But the category is required. Since the user didn't specify a category, maybe I need to leave it out? Wait, no, the function requires 'category' to be provided. So perhaps the user's query is missing that information. But the user said \"restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost\" which refers to price_range, not category. So maybe the category can be left as default? Wait, no, the function requires 'category' to be specified. So maybe the user's request is missing the category. But the user didn't mention it. Hmm, maybe the function allows for a default category? Let me check the parameters again. The parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' as required, but the 'price_range' has a default. So the user's query doesn't specify a category, so perhaps I need to choose a category? But the user didn't specify. Wait, maybe the user is okay with any category as long as the price is moderate and has outdoor seating. But the function requires a category. So perhaps the assistant needs to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave the category unspecified, but the function requires it. So maybe the user's request is missing that parameter. But the user's message says \"find some restaurants\" without specifying a type. So perhaps the assistant should choose a category, but the user didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for a default category. Wait, looking back, the parameters for the function have 'category' as required, but the 'price_range' has a default. So the category is required. Therefore, the user's query is missing the category. But the user didn't mention it. So maybe the assistant should proceed with a default category? But the function doesn't have a default for category. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe the user is okay with any category, but the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant needs to pick a category. But the user didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should point out that the category is required. However, the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. So perhaps the assistant should proceed by selecting a category, even if it's not specified. But the user's query doesn't mention a category. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default category. But the function's parameters don't have a default for category. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe the user intended to leave the category as a general search, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant might need to make an assumption. For example, maybe the assistant can choose a common category like 'American' or 'Italian' as a default. But the user didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed without the category, but that's not allowed. So perhaps the user's request is missing the category parameter. But the user's message says \"find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York\". So the category is not specified. Therefore, the assistant needs to make a choice here. Maybe the assistant can proceed by selecting a category, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, the assistant can't proceed because the category is required. But the user's query doesn't provide it. So perhaps the assistant should call the function with a default category. Wait, the function's parameters for category have an enum list, but no default. So the assistant must choose one. Maybe the assistant can choose 'American' as a default. But the user didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should call the function with a category, even if it's not specified. But the user's query doesn't mention it. So perhaps the assistant should proceed with a category, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, the assistant should point out that the category is required. However, the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. So perhaps the assistant should proceed with a category, even if it's not specified. For example, maybe the assistant can use 'American' as a default. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can leave the category as a parameter, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant must include a category. So the assistant might have to make a choice here. Let me check the function parameters again. The 'category' is required, and the 'price_range' has a default of 'moderate'. The user wants intermediate priced, which is 'moderate'. So the assistant can set price_range to 'moderate', location to 'New York, NY', has_seating_outdoors to True, and choose a category. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant can choose a category like 'American' or 'Italian'. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can leave the category as a parameter, but that's not allowed. Therefore, the assistant must choose a category. So the function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with category='American', location='New York, NY', price_range='moderate', has_seating_outdoors=True. But the user didn't specify the category. However, the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant has to make a choice. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed without the category, but that's not possible. Therefore, the assistant must include a category. So the function call would be made with a category, even if it's not specified by the user. But the user's query doesn't mention it. So perhaps the assistant should proceed with a default category.

But according to the problem statement, the assistant should make function calls if possible. \n\nWait, the user's question is about \"Imax film\" at Century Blackhawk Plaza. The function Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie requires movie_name, location, and show_date. The user hasn't provided the movie name, so the assistant can't call the function. Therefore, the assistant needs to inform the user that the movie name is required. \n\nBut the user might not know the exact movie title. So maybe the assistant should first use Movies_1_FindMovies to search for movies at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville, then get the times. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\n1. Use Movies_1_FindMovies to find movies at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville, with show_type as Imax. \n\nBut the user hasn't specified the genre or other parameters. The function requires location, which is provided as \"Century Blackhawk Plaza, Danville\" (but the location parameter is \"City, State\", so maybe \"Danville, CA\"?). \n\nWait, the location parameter for Movies_1_FindMovies is \"City, State\", so the user's location is \"Danville, CA\". The theater name is \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\". \n\nSo first, call Movies_1_FindMovies with location=\"Danville, CA\", theater_name=\"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type=\"imax\". Then, get the list of movies, and then for each movie, call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie with the movie name, location, and show_date (assuming today's date). \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the show_date, so the assistant needs to handle that. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant can call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie with the movie_name as \"Imax film\" (but that's not a valid movie name), which is not possible. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first find the available movies at the theater using Movies_1_FindMovies, then get the times for each. \n\nBut the user's question is to find out what's on (showtimes) for an Imax film at that theater. So the assistant needs to first find the movies available, then get the times. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the movie name, so the assistant can't proceed without that. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the list of movies at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville with show_type as Imax. Then, once the movies are known, the assistant can call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie for each movie, specifying the show_date as today's date. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the show_date, the assistant might need to assume today's date. However, the function requires it. \n\nSo the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the list of movies, then use that to get the times. \n\nBut the user's question is to find out what's on, so the assistant needs to proceed step by step. \n\nTherefore, the first function call should be Movies_1_FindMovies with location=\"Danville, CA\", theater_name=\"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type=\"imax\". \n\nThen, once the movies are found, the assistant can call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie for each movie, using today's date. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date, so the assistant might need to use today's date. However, the function requires it. \n\nSo the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the list of movies, then proceed to get the times. \n\nTherefore, the first function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with the given parameters."}

So I need to call FindEvents twice: once for Music and once for Theater, both in Las Vegas on the given date. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both types in one call, but the parameters require event_type to be one of the enums. So two separate calls might be necessary. Wait, the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents have 'event_type' as an enum with options 'Music' and 'Theater'. So to cover both, I need to make two separate function calls. Let me structure that."}

The has_quality_problem and has_late_check_in should be False to avoid providers with issues. \n\nSo the function call would include province_id=1, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", start_available_date=\"2024-03-22 00:00:00\", avg_rating=4.5, service_id=1, is_excellent=True. That should filter the providers based on the user's criteria."}

Hmm, maybe the function is designed to mark all reminders as completed when called with the token. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

The default is 'active', so if I call this function without any parameters, it should filter for active sites. The user wants actively configured websites, so status_filter='active' makes sense here. The include_metadata parameter is optional and defaults to False. Since the user didn't specify needing metadata, maybe it's safe to leave it as default. But wait, the user might want more details. However, the question just says \"provide me with all the actively configured websites,\" which probably refers to the basic settings, not metadata like creation dates. So maybe include_metadata=False is okay. \n\nAlternatively, the other function is website_configuration_api.WebsiteConfigurationApi.get_website, which requires a websiteId. But the user isn't asking for a specific website, but all active ones. So that's not the right function here. The third function is about service configurations, which doesn't relate to websites. So the correct function is get_websites with status_filter set to 'active'. Since the default for status_filter is already 'active', maybe I can just call get_websites without any parameters. But to be explicit, maybe include status_filter='active' to ensure it's active. Also, include_metadata is False by default, so that's fine. \n\nSo the function call should be get_websites with status_filter='active'. That should retrieve all active websites.

The user might need to call the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the default for include_revoked is False.

But the user didn't mention revoked tokens, but maybe they want all. However, the default for include_revoked is False. So the user might need to set it to True. But the user's request is to get all API tokens, so maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, maybe the second function is the right one, but without user_id, but the user provided it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function is for the user's tokens, and the user ID is not required because it's the current user.

But the user might not know about revoked tokens, but the function allows including them. Alternatively, maybe the second function is for all tokens, but the parameters don't include user_id. \n\nWait, the second function's parameters don't require user_id, so maybe it's for the current user. But the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary. However, the function's parameters don't include user_id, so maybe it's not needed. \n\nThis is a bit confusing.
