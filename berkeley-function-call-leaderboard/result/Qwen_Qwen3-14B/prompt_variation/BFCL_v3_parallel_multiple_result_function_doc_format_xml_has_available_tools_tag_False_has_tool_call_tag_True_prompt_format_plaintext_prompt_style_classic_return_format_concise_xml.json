The user has three parts to solve. \n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The energy per mole is given as 2800 kJ/mol. So I should use the biological.calc_energy function here. The parameters required are mols and substance. The mols are 5, and the substance is C6H12O6. The joules_per_mol is already provided, so I can include that as well.\n\nNext, using the total energy from the first step, I need to calculate the biomass produced with a 10% efficiency. The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. Since efficiency is 10%, which is 0.10 as a float, I'll plug that in.\n\nThird, the work done by the machine moving 2 meters. The physical.calc_work function requires energy and distance. The energy here is the same total energy from the first step, and the distance is 2 meters. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned using the total energy produced by the bacteria for the machine's work. So the energy input for calc_work is the same as the energy from calc_energy. But I need to make sure that the energy value is correctly passed. \n\nLet me check the parameters again. For calc_energy, the output is the total energy, which is 5 moles * 2800 kJ/mol = 14000 kJ. Then, calc_biomass uses that 14000 kJ with 10% efficiency. Then, the work done by the machine would be using the same 14000 kJ (assuming all energy is used for work, but the problem says the machine needs to move 2 meters. Wait, the work done by the machine is calculated from the energy produced by the bacteria and the distance. But the formula for work is energy = force * distance. However, the calc_work function here is described as calculating work from energy, which might be a bit confusing. Wait, the function's description says \"Calculate the work from energy.\" But work is typically force times distance. However, the parameters for calc_work are energy and distance. Maybe the function is designed to compute work as energy divided by distance? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, the function's description says \"Calculate the work from energy.\" But the parameters are energy and distance. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the function is intended to calculate work as energy equals work, but the distance is part of the calculation. Hmm, perhaps the function is using energy to compute work, but the parameters are energy and distance. Maybe the function is using energy = work, so work would be energy. But the distance is given, perhaps the function is using energy to compute work done over distance. But I'm not sure. However, according to the function's parameters, it requires energy and distance. So the user wants to calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy and the distance. So the function call would be to physical.calc_work with energy as 14000 kJ and distance as 2 meters. Even if the actual formula is unclear, the function is defined that way, so I have to follow it.\n\nSo the three steps are:\n\n1. Call calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800000 (since 2800 kJ is 2,800,000 J? Wait, the function's parameter for joules_per_mol is in kJ or J? The description says \"default value for glucose is 2800 kJ/mol\". So the parameter is in kJ, but the function's parameter is called joules_per_mol. Wait, that's a possible inconsistency. The user says the energy produced is 2800 kJ/mol, but the function's parameter is named joules_per_mol. So maybe the function expects the value in joules, so 2800 kJ would be 2,800,000 J. But the user might have intended to input 2800 as kJ. However, the function's parameter is named joules_per_mol, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the description. But since the function is defined as such, I have to use the value as given. Wait, the user says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\". So the value is 2800 kJ/mol. But the function's parameter is called joules_per_mol. So if the function expects joules, then 2800 kJ is 2,800,000 J. However, the user might have intended to use 2800 as kJ. But the function's parameter is in joules. This is a possible error. However, the user's instruction says to use the given parameters. So perhaps the function's parameter is in kJ, but the name is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the function's parameter is in kJ, and the name is a typo. But since the user provided the function definitions, I have to follow them. The function's parameter for joules_per_mol is described as \"The energy produced or required for the reaction, default value for glucose is 2800 kJ/mol\". So the value is 2800 kJ/mol, but the parameter is called joules_per_mol. That's conflicting. However, the user might have intended that the parameter is in kJ, so I should input 2800 as the value. But the function's parameter is named joules_per_mol, which is in joules. So this is a problem. However, the user's question says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\", so the value is 2800 kJ/mol. Therefore, if the function's parameter is in joules, then the value should be 2800000 J/mol. But the user might have made a mistake in the function's parameter name. However, since the function is defined as such, I have to proceed with the given parameters. So for the calc_energy function, the parameter is joules_per_mol, and the user says 2800 kJ/mol. Therefore, the value should be 2800000 J/mol. But the user might have intended to use 2800 as kJ. However, the function's parameter is in joules. This is a possible error, but I have to follow the function's definition. Therefore, the correct value is 2800000 J/mol. But the user's question says \"2800 kJ/mol\", so maybe the function's parameter is in kJ, and the name is a typo. But since the function's parameter is called joules_per_mol, I have to use the value in joules. This is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the given information. The user might have intended that the parameter is in kJ, so I'll use 2800 as the value. Alternatively, the function's parameter is in kJ, and the name is incorrect. But since the user provided the function definitions, I have to go with that. So I'll use 2800 as the value for joules_per_mol, assuming that the function's parameter is in kJ. Otherwise, the answer would be wrong. But this is a possible mistake. However, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the user's given value of 2800 kJ/mol, and input that as the joules_per_mol parameter, even though the name is incorrect. Alternatively, the function's parameter is in kJ, and the name is a typo. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, first function call: calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800.\n\nThen, the energy produced is 5 * 2800 = 14000 kJ. Then, calc_biomass with energy=14000 and efficiency=0.10.\n\nThird, calc_work with energy=14000 and distance=2. But wait, the energy in the work function is in joules? Or kJ? The function's parameter for energy is a float, but the unit isn't specified. However, the previous steps used kJ. But the work function's parameters are energy and distance. Assuming that the energy is in joules, but the previous steps used kJ. So there's a unit inconsistency. However, the user hasn't mentioned units, so perhaps the functions handle the units internally. Therefore, I'll proceed with the values as given, assuming that the units are consistent. So the energy from calc_energy is 14000 kJ, which is 14,000,000 J. But the function's parameters don't specify units, so I'll use the value as 14000 (assuming kJ) for the work function. However, the work function's parameters are energy and distance. The work done by the machine would be calculated as energy = force * distance. But the function's description says \"Calculate the work from energy.\" So perhaps the function is using energy as work. But the parameters are energy and distance. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to calculate work as energy divided by distance? Or maybe the function is a misnomer. But according to the function's description, it's \"Calculate the work from energy.\" So perhaps the work is equal to the energy. But then why is distance a parameter? This is confusing. However, the user's question says to calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy and the distance. So the function must be using energy and distance to compute work. But the standard formula is work = force * distance. However, without knowing the force, we can't compute work from energy and distance. Unless the energy is the work done. So if the energy is the work done, then the work is equal to the energy. But then the distance is irrelevant. This is conflicting. However, the function's parameters are energy and distance, so the user must have intended that the work is calculated using those two parameters. But without knowing the formula, it's hard to say. However, the user's instruction says to use the given functions. So I'll proceed with the function call as per the parameters given. So the third step is to call physical.calc_work with energy=14000 and distance=2. Even if the actual formula is unclear, the function is defined that way."}

The ingredients are chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, calories are 500, and the meal is lunch.\n\nThen, in the evening, they have a dinner recipe using beef but want to replace it with tofu, keeping calories under 600. The ingredient_replace function is needed here. The original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and the max calories after replacement is 600. However, I need to check if the original recipe's details are available. Since the user mentions they have a recipe, maybe the replace function can handle it based on the ingredients and calories provided. \n\nWait, the ingredient_replace function requires the original and replacement ingredients and the max calories. The user didn't specify the original recipe's calories, but they want the total after replacement to be under 600. So I'll use the parameters as given: original_ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, calories 600. \n\nI need to make three separate function calls for each part of the day. Let me structure each one properly with the correct parameters and types."}

The user has four separate requests here. First, they want the specific function of ATP in mitochondria. The cell_biology.function_lookup function seems right for that. I need to set molecule to \"ATP\", organelle to \"mitochondria\", and specific_function to true.\n\nNext, they want the driving distance from New York to LA in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle that. Origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles, and unit should be \"miles\".\n\nThird, they're asking about the scientist credited with the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes the discovery name, so \"theory of relativity\" is the parameter here.\n\nLastly, the price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function requires brand, model, and finish. Brand is Fender, model is Stratocaster, finish is sunburst.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly specified and that each function is called in order. No parameters are missing here, so all four functions should be called sequentially."}

The user has several tasks here. First, modifying a painting, then predicting an evolutionary rate, and finally calculating a probability.\n\nStarting with the painting modification. The original details are 24x36 inches, acrylic, dominant color blue. The user wants to change the size to 30x40, medium to oil, and dominant color to red. The function modify_painting requires size, medium, and dominant_color. All the necessary parameters are provided, so I can call that function with the new values.\n\nNext, predicting the evolutionary rate for African elephants over 100 years using the Darwin model. The function prediction.evolution needs species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, and model is Darwin. All required parameters are present, so that's doable.\n\nThen, the probability of a royal flush. The function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52 cards, favorable are 4, and round to 3 decimals. Wait, but in poker, a royal flush is 4 possible hands (one for each suit), but the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5) which is 2,598,960. Oh, wait the user said total outcomes is 52, but that's incorrect. However, the user specified that there are 4 possible outcomes for a royal flush. But the function parameters are given as total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user might have made a mistake here, but according to the question, they want to use total_outcomes=52 and favorable=4. Even though that's not accurate for poker, the user's instruction says so. So I should use those numbers as per their request. The round_to is 3. So call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nSo three function calls: modify_painting, prediction.evolution, calculate_probability."}

The function predict_house_price requires all these parameters: area, rooms, year, and location. So I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. The user specified county as San Francisco and the state is California, which is the default. So I'll use entity \"Mr. John Doe\", county \"San Francisco\", and state \"California\".\n\nThird, the probability of winning a lottery with total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. So those parameters would be 1000, 5, and 3 respectively.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. For the house price, all required parameters are there. For lawsuits, entity and county are required, and state is optional but provided. For probability, total and favorable are required, and round_to is optional but specified. So all three functions can be called."}

The game_score.highest function can handle that. Parameters would be game 'Fortnite', platform 'Playstation', and region 'Asia'.\n\nThen, lawsuits involving Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function is the one. Company_name is 'Apple Inc.', year 2018. Case_type isn't specified, so leave it out.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, probability 0.7.
