I should use what's implied: let's say [\"email\", \"ssn\"].\n\n   The function requires exact parameters, and the user didn't specify the exact column names.

So, I can't call this function without it.\n\nIn my response, I should only return function calls if I can, but if parameters are missing, I need to point it out. However, the instructions say: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" And \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point out.\" But it specifies to put function calls in that JSON format, and not include other text.\n\nRe-reading: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ```json ... ```. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I can't invoke due to missing parameters, I shouldn't output anything? But that doesn't make sense. The prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then it says to only return function calls.\n\nPerhaps I need to not output anything if I can't proceed. But that might not be right. Let's think.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, I have:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\"\n\n- table: \"personal_data\"\n\n- operation: \"delete\"\n\n- columns: [\"email\", \"ssn\"]  (assuming these are the names)\n\nThe user didn't specify the exact column names.

It says if parameters are lacking, point it out, but in the response format, I have to use the JSON for function calls.\n\nPerhaps I can only call the functions for which I have all required parameters.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, I have all except perhaps the exact column names, but I can infer them.\n\nThis is tricky.

First, call **game_missions.list** to get all missions for Fortnite.\n\n2.

If I don't specify, it defaults to empty string, which might mean it returns rewards in general or for all.\n\nThe user wants \"different missions and trophies,\" so ideally, I need to query for specifics.\n\nI don't have a list of missions yet.

Nothing else.\n\nFormat: \n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{\"param1\":\"value1\",\"param2\":\"value2\"}}]\n```\n\nSo, for this, it would be:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"library.find_nearby\", \"parameters\":{\"location\":\"New York City\", \"preferences\":[\"Pet-friendly\", \"Disabled Access\"]}}]\n```\n\nI should ensure that the preferences are exactly as in the enum. The enum uses title case: 'Pet-friendly' and 'Disabled Access', so I'll use that.\n\nThis seems to fulfill the user's request in one call. Once I make this call, the system will handle it, and if needed, I can respond further in subsequent turns.\n\nI don't need to call any other functions."}

'n_rolls' is optional.\n\n2. **flip_coin_probability**: This is for coins, not relevant.\n\n3. **shuffle_card_probability**: This is for cards, not relevant.\n\nSo, the appropriate function is **dice_roll_probability**.\n\nNow, let's check the parameters needed:\n\n- Required: 'desired_sum' and 'sides_per_die'.\n\n- The user specified: \"rolling a sum of 7 on a roll of two dice.\"\n\n  - Desired sum: 7\n\n  - Number of dice: 2 (this matches 'n_rolls', which is optional, so I can include it)\n\n  - Sides per die: Typically, dice have 6 sides, but the user didn't specify. The function requires 'sides_per_die', so I need that value.\n\nThe user said \"two dice\", but didn't explicitly say how many sides. In standard contexts, dice are 6-sided, but I should confirm if I have all required parameters.\n\nThe function's description: \"Calculate the probability of a specific sum appearing from rolling two dice.\" But in the parameters, it says 'n_rolls' is optional with default 1, and 'sides_per_die' is required.\n\nFor this query:\n\n- desired_sum: 7\n\n- n_rolls: 2 (since it's two dice)\n\n- sides_per_die: Not specified by the user. I need to assume or know it's 6 for standard dice.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n'sides_per_die' is required, and the user didn't provide it. However, in the context, it's implied to be standard dice, which are 6-sided.\n\nBut strictly speaking, the question doesn't explicitly state it, so I should not assume and point it out? No, the system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" And in the response format, I should only return function calls or point it out, but the format is to only return JSON for function calls or indicate if none can be used.\n\nRe-reading the prompt: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nIt says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" But earlier: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ```json ... ```. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I can't invoke it due to missing parameters, I need to point it out, but how? The prompt doesn't specify a format for that. It says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" And then \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Perhaps I should not return any function call if parameters are missing.\n\nIn this case, I can reasonably assume standard dice have 6 sides. The function description mentions \"rolling two dice,\" implying standard ones.\n\nTo be precise, let's see the function's description: \"Calculate the probability of a specific sum appearing from rolling two dice.\" In the available functions list, it's general, not specific to two dice.\n\nI think it's safe to proceed with sides_per_die as 6.\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- function: \"dice_roll_probability\"\n\n- parameters:\n\n  - desired_sum: 7\n\n  - n_rolls: 2  (optional, but specified)\n\n  - sides_per_die: 6  (assuming standard)\n\nI need to format it as:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"dice_roll_probability\",\"parameters\":{\"desired_sum\":7,\"n_rolls\":2,\"sides_per_die\":6}}]\n```\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIs 'n_rolls' the number of dice? Yes, the description says: \"Number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\"\n\nAnd the user said \"two dice,\" so n_rolls=2.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. I'll make this function call."}

The description matches perfectly: \"Find the most popular paint color for a specific area in the home.\"\n\n3. **house_price_trends**: This is for average house prices in a location. Not related to paint colors.\n\nSo, the appropriate function is **paint_color.trends**.\n\nNow, let's check the parameters for **paint_color.trends**:\n\n- **room**: Required. Type: string.

Default is 'Daily'.\n\nThe user specified \"living rooms\", which directly maps to the 'room' parameter. I can use \"Living room\" as the value.\n\nThe user is asking for the \"currently most popular\", which might imply the shortest period, like 'Daily'. Since the default is 'Daily', I don't have to specify it, but to be precise, I should use 'Daily' for \"currently\".\n\nThe question says \"currently\", so 'Daily' makes sense.\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON array of function calls. Specifically:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{\"param1\":\"value1\",...}}]\n```\n\nFor this, I'll call **paint_color.trends** with:\n\n- room: \"Living room\"\n\n- period: \"Daily\" (to match \"currently\")\n\nIs 'period' required?

It also has an optional 'size'.\n\nThe user is asking about material options. From the function description, the materials are enumerated: ['Bronze', 'Marble', 'Terracotta', 'Wood', 'Stone'].\n\nThe user is making a request that involves two parts:\n\n1. Ordering a custom bronze sculpture of a horse.\n\n2. Asking what material options are available.\n\nFor the ordering part, I can use **sculpture.create_custom** with item='horse' and material='Bronze'.\n\nFor the material options, the functions don't have a specific one to query or list options. The material options are defined in the function's parameters, but I can't directly call a function to just list them. I have to use the provided functions as they are.\n\nMy instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nFor the ordering part, I can make a function call to **sculpture.create_custom**.\n\nFor the material options, there's no function to directly answer that. I shouldn't add extra text; I should only return function calls.\n\nI need to handle the user's request as best as I can. The primary action is to order the sculpture, and the material question might be rhetorical since they're specifying bronze.\n\nIn the function **sculpture.create_custom**, the materials are fixed, so perhaps I don't need to call anything for that.\n\nThe user is asking a question about options, which isn't directly addressable by a function call.\n\nI should proceed with what I can do: call the function to create the sculpture as specified.\n\nIf I call **sculpture.create_custom** with the given parameters, that fulfills the ordering part.\n\nFor the options, since I can't call a function for that, I might need to ignore it or not respond, but the instructions say to only return function calls.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

Vegan is a subset of vegetarian, but not exactly the same. The function parameters for categories are an array with enum values: ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nFor walmart.vegan_products, the categories can be ['vegan', 'gluten-free']. So, I can specify both.\n\nThe function is named \"vegan_products\", but it allows searching for 'vegan' and/or 'gluten-free' categories. I need to check if this fits.\n\nThe description: \"Get available vegan products at specified Walmart store\", but the parameters include categories: ['vegan', 'gluten-free']. So, it might return products that match the specified categories.\n\nThe user asked for \"vegetarian\", but the enum only has 'vegan'. There's no 'vegetarian' option. This is a problem.\n\nThe enum is: ['vegan', 'gluten-free']. So, I can't directly search for 'vegetarian'; only 'vegan' which is related but not identical.\n\nI need to point out if the function doesn't match exactly. The instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIn this case, the function exists for Walmart, and it requires 'location', which is provided as \"Denver, CO\" implicitly (near Denver, so I can use \"Denver, CO\").\n\nBut for categories, the user wants \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", and I can only provide 'vegan' and 'gluten-free'. Should I approximate 'vegetarian' as 'vegan'?\n\nThe function might not perfectly match, but I should use what's available. The instructions don't say to refuse; they say to make function calls if possible.\n\nThe parameters description: \"Product categories to search within. Default empty array\" with enum ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nSo, I can pass ['vegan', 'gluten-free'] as categories, even though the user said 'vegetarian'.\n\nTo be precise, I should note that 'vegan' is not exactly 'vegetarian', but since I have to only return function calls, I need to proceed.\n\nThe response format is strict: only return the JSON for function calls, or point it out, but the instructions say: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I can't fulfill it exactly, should I still call the function?\n\nThe instructions: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But here, a function can be used, just not perfectly.\n\nI think I should call it with the closest match.\n\nFor walmart.vegan_products, parameters: location and categories.\n\nLocation: \"Denver, CO\" seems appropriate.\n\nCategories: I can use ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], as that's what's available.\n\nThe user said \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", so perhaps pass ['gluten-free'] and note that vegan is a subset, but I can't note; I have to just call.\n\nMaybe don't call if it doesn't match, but I think it's better to call with what we have.\n\nThe function name is \"vegan_products\", but it accepts 'gluten-free' as a category, so it might return products that are gluten-free, even if not vegan.\n\nTo match the user's request as closely as possible, I'll use ['vegan', 'gluten-free'] for categories, assuming that 'vegan' might include some vegetarian options.\n\n'Vegan' is stricter than 'vegetarian', so it won't cover all vegetarian products.\n\nThis is tricky. Perhaps I should only include 'gluten-free' since 'vegetarian' isn't an option.\n\nThe user wants both: vegetarian AND gluten-free, which would be products that are both.\n\nSince I can't search for vegetarian, maybe I can't fulfill it.\n\nPerhaps the best is to call the function with ['gluten-free'], as that's the only matching category.\n\nBut that doesn't include vegetarian.\n\nThe functions are specifically for 'vegan' products, so maybe it's not suitable.\n\nLet's check the description again: \"Get available vegan products\", and categories include 'vegan' and 'gluten-free', so if I select ['gluten-free'], it might get gluten-free products, which could include vegetarian ones, but not specifically.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I think I should call the function with the categories that match what the user asked that are available.\n\nUser asked for: vegetarian and gluten-free.\n\nAvailable: vegan and gluten-free.\n\nSo, perhaps pass ['gluten-free'], as 'vegan' is not what they asked.\n\nBut they asked for both, so maybe pass both and let the function handle it.\n\nI need to make a decision. Since the function allows it, I'll pass ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nLocation: \"Denver, CO\".\n\nSo, the function call would be: {\"function\": \"walmart.vegan_products\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"Denver, CO\", \"categories\": [\"vegan\", \"gluten-free\"]}}\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nFinally, output in the specified JSON format."}

Standardize is optional but the user specified to apply it, so I should set it to True.\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- predictors: ['Age', 'Income', 'Education']  (This is an array of strings)\n\n- target: 'Purchase_Amount'  (A string)\n\n- standardize: True  (Boolean)\n\nI need to format my response exactly as specified: A JSON array of objects, where each object has \"function\" and \"parameters\".\n\nSince this is a single function call, it'll be an array with one object.\n\nResponse format:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"func_name1\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"param1\": \"value1\",\n\n      ...\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  ...\n\n]\n\n```\n\nFor this, it should be:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"run_linear_regression\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"predictors\": [\"Age\", \"Income\", \"Education\"],\n\n      \"target\": \"Purchase_Amount\",\n\n      \"standardize\": true\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\n```\n\nMake sure it's valid JSON. In JSON, boolean is lowercase: true, not True.\n\nThe user has provided all necessary parameters, so no issues there.\n\nThis should complete the task in one turn, as it's a direct function call.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY be this JSON array, nothing else."}

Don't call the function because language is missing and point it out, but I can't include other text.\n\n2. Make an assumption and call it with a default language.\n\nThe system prompt doesn't allow including other text, so if I can't call it, I shouldn't respond with anything? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I should just call it with the available information and let the function handle it, but that's not ideal.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in the response format, it's only for function calls.\n\nI need to follow the instruction strictly: only return function calls if I can, otherwise, don't respond or handle it in the next turn, but the prompt says to point it out.\n\nThis is tricky. Looking back: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and before that, \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But how?\n\nPerhaps in the response, if I can't, I don't return anything, but that contradicts.\n\nMaybe I can call the function with the missing parameter if I can infer it.\n\nThe text is in English, so I'll assume 'language': 'en'.\n\nThat might be the best way to proceed, as the system says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks.\"\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\nFunction call: sentiment_analysis with text = \"I love the food here!

If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous, but in the context, I think if I can't call a function, I should not output the JSON, but the system might handle it. However, the prompt says to point it out, but then says not to include other text.\n\nFor this case, since the function requires parameters that aren't provided, I should not make the call and instead point it out. But how?\n\nThe prompt: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nAnd \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" This might mean that if I'm making a call, only include the JSON, but if not, perhaps output something else.

Description: The name of the video game. User provided: 'Zelda'.\n\n- **username**: Required. Description: The username of the player. User provided: 'Sam'.\n\n- **platform**: Not required, but has a default of 'PC'.

The user might need more interactions, but based on the instructions, I should try to complete the task in the current turn.

Nothing else.\n\nThe format is:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{\"param1\":\"value1\",\"param2\":\"value2\"}}]\n```\n\nFor this, it would be:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"currency_conversion.convert\",\"parameters\":{\"amount\":150,\"from_currency\":\"EUR\",\"to_currency\":\"CAD\"}}]\n```\n\nIs 150 an integer? Yes, and the parameter is defined as an integer, so that's fine.\n\nAfter this call, if I need more information, I could ask, but in this case, I have all the required parameters.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nThis seems to be a single function call that should fulfill the request.\n\nOnce I output this, the system will handle the execution.\n\nI shouldn't add any other text; just the JSON array."}
