The formula for displacement when there's constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Here, u is initial speed, a is acceleration, t is time. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters. It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and an optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. So I can use that function. \n\nI don't need to calculate final speed here because the question is about displacement. So the correct function to call is calculate_displacement with the given values. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe default to 2 decimal places. The function should handle the calculation."}

The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I should call store_price with these parameters. \n\nWait, the region parameter has a default of United States, but since the user specifically mentioned United States, including it is okay. No problem there. \n\nI don't think the other functions are relevant here. The on_sale function checks if the game is on sale, but the user wants the price. The store_currency function gives the currency, but the question is about the price, not the currency type. So the correct function is store_price. \n\nSo the function call should be video_games.store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'.

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are kinematic equations. Since it's starting from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance and time, and asks for the final speed. \n\nThe function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here. It requires distance, time, and initial_speed (which is 0 by default). Let me check the parameters. The function's args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds. So plugging those into the function should work. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters are specified as integers. The example uses 20 and 4, which are integers. So using calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4 should give the correct speed. I don't need to use calculate_acceleration here because the question is asking for speed, not acceleration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe calculate_acceleration could be used to find acceleration first, then use another formula to find final speed. But since there's a direct function available, that's better. \n\nSo the correct function call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default, so no need to specify it. That should give the final speed."}

Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function. I don't need to calculate mass here because the question is about temperature mixing, not mass. The calculate_mass function isn't necessary here.

The parameters are elements (the list) and order (default 'asc'). Since the user specified ascending, I don't need to change the default. So I should call sort_list with elements set to the list provided and order as 'asc' or just rely on the default. But to be explicit, maybe include order='asc' anyway. The function should handle that. \n\nWait, the parameters for sort_list are elements and order. The elements are the list of names. The order is 'asc' by default. So even if I don't specify order, it should work. But the user explicitly said ascending, so including order='asc' makes it clear. \n\nSo the correct function call would be sort_list(elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], order='asc'). That should sort the list in ascending order. Let me double-check. The function returns the sorted list. Yep, that's right. No other functions are needed here. The other functions are for filtering or summing, which don't apply to names. So the answer is to call sort_list with those parameters."}

That's 6 combinations. So the probability would be 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6. \n\nBut wait, the functions provided include dice_roll_probability. Let me check the parameters. The function requires desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The default for n_rolls is 1, but here we need two dice. Oh, wait, the n_rolls parameter might be the number of dice rolled. So if the user is rolling two dice, n_rolls should be 2. The sides_per_die is 6 by default, which is correct for standard dice. So the desired_sum is 7. Therefore, the function call should be dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6). That should calculate the probability correctly. I don't see any other functions that apply here, like flip_coin or shuffle_card. So the correct function to use is dice_roll_probability with those parameters."}
