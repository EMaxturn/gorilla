The drink needs to be a large hot coffee. The ChaDri.change_drink function requires drink_id, new_preferences. The new_preferences include size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type, and special_instructions. The user specified large, hot, regular sweetness, almond milk. So I'll set those parameters.

The user wants to perform several actions on a GitHub repository. First, they need to clone the repo. The steps mention cloning, then analyzing the contents, creating Docker and Kubernetes YAML files, adding changes to Git, and pushing them.\n\nStarting with step 1: Cloning the repo. The provided function is clone_repo, which requires the repo_url. The user specified git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so I'll use that URL. The destination is the current working directory by default, so no need to specify it. So, the first function call is clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL.\n\nNext, step 2 requires analyzing the repo's contents. The function analyse_repo_contents takes directory_name. The user hasn't provided the directory name yet, but the repo is already cloned. Wait, the initial step was cloning, so the directory is the cloned path. But the parameters for analyse_repo_contents require a directory_name. Since the repo is cloned, maybe the directory is the path where the analysis is done. So, I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name as the cloned path.\n\nThen, step 2.1 is to create a Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file needs the directory_name. The directory is the cloned repo, so I'll use that. Also, the analysis result will determine the language, which is needed for creating the Dockerfile. So, after analysing, I need to call create_a_docker_file with the directory_name from the cloned repo.\n\nStep 2.2 is creating Kubernetes YAML files. The function create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. Again, the directory is the cloned repo. So, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name as the cloned path.\n\nStep 3 is adding all changed files to Git. The function push_git_changes_to_github needs directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't provided commit message or branch, so I'll use default values. The commit message defaults to \"Update changes\", branch to \"main\", and force_push to false. So, push_git_changes_to_github with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. The function pushes all changes, so that's covered. So all these steps need to be executed in order. Each function call is needed for each step. Let me check if all parameters are correctly set. For example, in step 2.1, the Dockerfile is created based on the analysis. The analyse_repo_contents function's output would determine the programming language, which is used to create the Dockerfile. So, the function calls need to be made in sequence.\n\nI think that's all. Each step is a separate function call. Let me structure the <TOOLCALL> tags with each function call."}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions provided. The 'get_relevant_classes' function seems relevant for finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to True. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find relevant classes.\n\nNext, for the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function requires 'class_name', 'method_name', and 'include_private'. The user wants the signatures of those methods. So I need to call get_signature with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name 'setCellValue', and include_private as True. Similarly, for 'getCellValue', call get_signature with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name 'getCellValue', and include_private as True.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned overriding those methods. So the 'get_signature' function should return the method signatures. The 'get_relevant_classes' function will give the list of classes, which might include 'CellResult' if it's in the repository. So the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with the parameters, then call get_signature for each method in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The 'get_relevant_classes' function's parameters are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The user's search string is 'CellResult', case_sensitive is True (since they mentioned including subdirectories but the default is False, but maybe case sensitivity is important here?), and include_subdirectories is True. The 'get_signature' function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. So the function calls should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\nget_relevant_classes<search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=\"True\">\n</TOOLCALL>\n<TOOLCALL>\nget_signature<class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\", include_private=\"True\">\n</TOOLCALL>\n<TOOLCALL>\nget_signature<class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\", include_private=\"True\">\n</TOOLCALL>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

They want two things: the area of a square with a side of 5 cm and the weather in Queenstown Singapore.\n\nFirst, for the area of the square. The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned a side of 5 cm, so I need to convert that into a float. Since 5 cm is 0.05 meters, but the function expects a float, maybe the input is already in cm. Wait, the function's parameter is a float, so if the user says 5 cm, that's 5.0 in float. So I can call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a 'location' parameter. The user specified Queenstown Singapore. The location format is 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So Queenstown, NS or Singapore, NS? The user wrote Queenstown Singapore, so maybe the correct format is Queenstown, NS. The unit is optional, but the default is fahrenheit. So I need to call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, NS\" and unit could be omitted, but maybe include it for clarity. Wait, the parameters for get_current_weather have 'unit' as an enum with 'celsius' and 'fahrenheit', default 'fahrenheit'. The user didn't specify the unit, so maybe leave it as default. So the two function calls would be get_area_of_square with size=5.0 and get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, NS\".\n\nI need to check if all parameters are present. The first function requires 'size' which is provided, and the second requires 'location' which is provided. So both functions can be called. No missing parameters here.
