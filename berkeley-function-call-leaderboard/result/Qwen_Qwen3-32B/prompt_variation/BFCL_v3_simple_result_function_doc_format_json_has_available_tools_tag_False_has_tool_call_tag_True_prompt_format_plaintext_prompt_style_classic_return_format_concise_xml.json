The database parameter has a default value of 'CustomerInfo', so if the user specifies a different one, we use that.

So the probabilities should multiply.\n\nThe function provided is probability.dice_roll. Let me check the parameters. It requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides. The user specified a six-sided die, so die_sides is 6, which is the default. The desired number is 6, and the number of rolls is 2.

However, the user provided both city and state. Maybe the function can handle it, or maybe it's better to follow the user's input exactly. Since the parameter is a string, I can pass \"Los Angeles, California\" as the location.

The user is asking for 'rating' and 'player count', both of which are in the enum. So I should call the function with the name 'Ticket to Ride' and parameters ['rating', 'player count']. Also, there's an optional 'language' parameter, but since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default English. So the tool call should be correct."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the required parameters for the hotel_booking function. The required fields are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The user provided all of these: location is Manhattan, New York, room_type is single, duration is 3 nights, and start_date is March 10th, 2023. \n\nAdditionally, the user specified a preference for a pet-friendly hotel. The preferences parameter is an array that includes options like pet_friendly. So I should include that in the preferences array.\n\nWait, the location parameter is a string. The user said \"near Manhattan, New York\". Should I use \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location? Yes, that's the city they want. The function's location parameter is a string, so that's correct.\n\nThe start_date is March 10th, 2023. The format for the date isn't specified, but the function expects a string. It's safer to use a standard date format like \"YYYY-MM-DD\", so March 10th would be \"2023-03-10\".\n\nPreferences: The user mentioned \"pet friendly\", which is one of the enum options. So the preferences array should include \"pet_friendly\". The other preferences are optional, and the user didn't mention them, so we don't include them. The default is to use all if not specified, but since the user specifically wants pet-friendly, we should only include that.\n\nPutting it all together, the function call should have location: \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type: \"single\", duration: 3, start_date: \"2023-03-10\", and preferences: [\"pet_friendly\"].\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The duration is an integer, so 3 is correct. The start_date as a string in the correct format. Preferences as an array with the correct enum value. Everything seems to check out."}
