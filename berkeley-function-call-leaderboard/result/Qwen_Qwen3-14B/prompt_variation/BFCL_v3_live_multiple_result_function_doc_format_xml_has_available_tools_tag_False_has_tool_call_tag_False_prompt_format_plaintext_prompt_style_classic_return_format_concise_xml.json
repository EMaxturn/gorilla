I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nFor uber.ride, the parameters required are loc (string), type (string), and time (integer). The loc needs to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format. The user's address is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. All required parameters are present here.\n\nUber.ride2 also requires loc, type, and time (optional). But the loc format for ride2 is 'City, State', but the user provided a full address. So ride2 might not be suitable because the loc parameter here is a full address, not just city and state. Also, the time is optional in ride2, but the user specified 10 minutes, so that's okay. However, since ride has all the required parameters and the correct loc format, it's better to use ride.\n\nSo the correct function call is uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'Plus', and time 10."}

The language isn't mentioned, but since the query is in Korean, maybe setting language to Korean makes sense. However, the function's language parameter is optional, so maybe it's okay to omit it if the default is already Korean. But the user might prefer Korean results, so including language=\"ko\" could be better. Let me check the function's parameters again. The HNA_WQA.search function's language parameter is optional, so adding it with \"ko\" would ensure the results are in Korean. Also, max_results is 10, which is an integer.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The functions available include searching archival memory and recall memory. Since the user didn't provide the birthday info, I should check the archival memory first. Maybe there's a record there. If not, perhaps the recall memory has it in past conversations. But if neither has it, I can't proceed without that info.\n\nAssuming I can't find it in the memories, the next step is to inform the user that I don't have the birthday details. But the user also wants a congratulatory message sent. However, without the birthday date, I can't schedule the message. The send_message function requires the message content and recipient.

Let me check the archival_memory_search function. I'll use that to search for \"Shishir Patil birthday\" and see if there's any result. If there's a result, I can extract the date and then send the message. If not, I need to tell the user I can't find the info. Also, the send_message function needs the recipient's details. If the user hasn't provided Shishir's contact info, I can't send the message. But the user's question doesn't mention that, so maybe they expect me to have that info in memory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in assuming I have that data. In any case, the steps are: search for birthday, if found, send message; if not, inform user. But since the user hasn't provided the necessary details, I might need to ask for them. However, the current functions don't include asking the user for input; the only way is to send a message. So, if I can't find the birthday or the recipient's info, I should send a message stating that the information isn't available. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to send a congratulatory message, so maybe they expect me to proceed with the available info.

Therefore, the correct approach is to first search the archival memory for the birthday, then check if the recipient's info is available. If not, send a message indicating the lack of information."}
{"id": "live_multiple_44-17-0", "result": "<functions><function name=\"Alltransactions\"><param name=\"statement_period\" type=\"string\">2019-10</param><param name=\"include_pending\" type=\"boolean\">false</param></function></functions>", "input_token_count": 2307, "output_token_count": 1675, "latency": 28.08571481704712, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help. The BankStatementOverView function seems right for the overview. It requires bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided most of these: bank is U.S. Bank, account number is given, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview is a summary, which might come from another function.\n\nBut the user also mentioned total deposits, withdrawals, and balances. The TotalTransactions.calculate function could compute those, but the user already provided the totals. Maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can create the summary. It needs transactions array, dates, totals, balances, and customer names. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. \n\nWait, the user might not have the individual transactions, so maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve them. But the Alltransactions function needs a statement period in YYYY-MM format. The user's period is October 2019, so that's 2019-10. But the user hasn't provided the include_pending parameter, which is optional. However, the user might not have that info. \n\nBut the user is asking for a summary, which might not require individual transactions. Maybe the BankStatementOverView can take the totals provided. However, the transaction_overview parameter is a dict, which the user hasn't provided. They have total deposits and withdrawals, but the function might need more detailed info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used with the provided totals and dates. But that function requires an array of transactions, which the user hasn't given. So perhaps the user expects the system to generate the summary using the totals they provided. But the functions available don't seem to allow that. \n\nWait, the user might be expecting the BankStatementOverView function to be called with the given data. Let me check the parameters again. The transaction_overview is a required dict. The user hasn't provided that, but maybe the system can generate it using the totals. However, the function's description says it's a summary of transactions within the period, including totals and counts. The user provided total deposits and withdrawals, so maybe that's enough. \n\nSo, the steps would be: call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters, including the transaction_overview as a dict with the totals. But the user hasn't provided the exact transaction overview, but they have the total deposits, withdrawals, and balances. Maybe the transaction_overview can be constructed from that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the system to use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to compute the totals, but the user already provided them. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the functions again. The BankStatementOverView requires the transaction_overview as a dict. The user hasn't provided that, but they have the total deposits and withdrawals. Maybe the transaction_overview can be a dict with keys like total_deposits, total_withdrawals, etc. \n\nSo, the function call would be to BankStatementOverView with the parameters: bank_name \"U.S. Bank\", account_number \"1-523-1713-5704\", account_type \"checking\", full_name \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\", and transaction_overview as a dict containing the totals provided. \n\nBut the user also mentioned including a summary of transactions. Maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed, but that requires individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Alltransactions function can be called to get the transactions for October 2019, but the user hasn't provided the include_pending parameter. However, the function allows it to be optional. So, maybe call Alltransactions with statement_period \"2019-10\" and include_pending as false (assuming pending transactions aren't needed). Then, use that data to generate the summary. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the assistant might need to call Alltransactions first to get the data. However, the user's question is to provide the overview, which might require the transaction data. \n\nThis is a bit of a loop. The assistant might need to call Alltransactions to get the transactions for the period, then use that data to generate the summary and the BankStatementOverView. But since the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, the assistant can't proceed without that data. \n\nWait, but the user is asking the assistant to provide the overview, which implies that the assistant has the necessary data. However, the functions available require specific parameters. The assistant might need to call Alltransactions to retrieve the transactions for the period, then use that data to generate the summary. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the include_pending parameter. The function allows it to be optional, so the assistant can assume a default value, like false. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call Alltransactions with statement_period \"2019-10\" and include_pending false to get the list of transactions.\n\n2. Use the transactions from step 1 to generate the transaction summary via transaction_summary.generate, along with the provided totals and dates.\n\n3. Call BankStatementOverView with the account details and the transaction overview generated in step 2.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the assistant can't generate the summary without that data. Therefore, the assistant needs to call Alltransactions first to retrieve the transactions. \n\nHowever, the user's question is to provide the overview, which might require the assistant to have the transaction data. Since the assistant can't know that data without calling Alltransactions, the correct approach is to call Alltransactions first. \n\nBut the user might not have provided the necessary parameters for Alltransactions. Wait, the user did provide the statement period as October 2019, which is \"2019-10\" in the required format. So, the assistant can call Alltransactions with that parameter. \n\nTherefore, the first function call should be Alltransactions with statement_period \"2019-10\" and include_pending false (assuming pending transactions are not needed). Then, once the transactions are retrieved, the assistant can use them to generate the summary and the BankStatementOverView. \n\nBut the user's question is to provide the overview, which includes the transaction summary. So, the assistant needs to make multiple function calls. However, the user's initial request might require the assistant to call the necessary functions in sequence. \n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant should make the function calls in the response. So, the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then use that data to generate the summary and the BankStatementOverView. However, the assistant can't know the transactions without calling Alltransactions first. \n\nTherefore, the first function call is Alltransactions with the given parameters. Then, the next step would be to use the retrieved transactions to generate the summary and the overview. But since the assistant can only make one function call per turn, the initial response would be to call Alltransactions. \n\nBut the user's question is to provide the overview, which might require multiple steps. However, the assistant is supposed to make the necessary function calls in the response. So, the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then proceed with the other functions. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the assistant must call Alltransactions first. Therefore, the correct function call is Alltransactions with statement_period \"2019-10\" and include_pending false."}

The user didn't specify, so I can omit it or set it to true. But the function might have a default. However, the function's parameters don't mention a default value. So maybe it's better to include it as true to get all details. But the user's question is just asking for the tech stack, which probably includes tools. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is to include tools. But since the parameter is optional, maybe the function will include them by default. But to be safe, maybe include it as true. However, the user didn't specify, so perhaps the best approach is to call the function with employee_id=\"Adriel\" and include_tools=true. Wait, but the user's question is straightforward, so maybe just the employee_id is needed. Let me check the function's required parameters. The employee_id is required, others are optional. So the minimal call is get_tech_stack with employee_id=\"Adriel\". The other parameters can be omitted. The function will handle defaults. So the correct function call is to use get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\"."}

{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants. Its parameters include category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. \n\nThe user specified \"intermediate priced,\" which I can map to the price_range parameter. The location is New York, but the function requires the format 'City, State'. The user didn't mention the state, but since New York is a city, maybe the state is NY. So location would be 'New York, NY'.\n\nThey also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be set to true. The category isn't specified, so I need to check if it's required. The function's category parameter is required, but the user didn't mention a cuisine type. Wait, the user didn't specify a category, but the function requires it. That's a problem. The user's query doesn't have the category, which is a required parameter. \n\nHmm, maybe the category is optional? Let me check again. The function's parameters show category as required. So without that, I can't call the function. But the user didn't specify a category. Wait, the user's message says \"tagged as intermediate priced\" but maybe the category is missing. However, the function requires category. So perhaps the user's query is missing that parameter. But the user might not know the category, so maybe I should proceed with the available info and leave category as a required parameter. Wait, but the function requires it. So I need to have a value for category. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I can't proceed. But maybe the category can be inferred? Or perhaps the user intended to leave it out, but the function requires it. \n\nWait, the user's original request is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category isn't mentioned. So maybe the function call can't be made because category is required. But the user didn't provide it. However, maybe the category is optional? Let me check the function definition again. \n\nLooking back: <param name=\"category\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">. Yes, it's required. So the user's query is missing the category. Therefore, I can't call the function without that. But the user might not know the category. However, the assistant has to work with the given info. So perhaps the answer is that the parameters are missing. But the user might have intended to leave it out. Alternatively, maybe the category can be left as a general term, but the function requires it. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York.\" So the category isn't specified. Therefore, the function call can't be made because category is required. But the assistant needs to point out that the parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to use a default or general category. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. However, the user might not have provided it. \n\nBut the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Maybe the category is not specified, so the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer should be that the required parameter 'category' is missing. However, the user might have intended to use a general category, but the function requires it. So the assistant should point out that the category is missing. But the user didn't mention it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by leaving category as a required parameter, but that's not allowed. The function requires it, so the assistant must have it. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameter 'category' is missing from the user's query. However, the user might not have provided it. \n\nBut the user's question is about finding restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category is required, but the user didn't specify. Therefore, the assistant can't make the function call. So the answer is that the required parameter 'category' is missing. But the user might not know the category. However, the assistant must follow the function's parameters. \n\nWait, maybe the user intended to use a general category, but the function requires it. So the assistant should inform the user that the category is missing. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the 'category' parameter is missing. But the user's message didn't include it. \n\nBut the user's message says \"restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost.

Let me look at the functions available. There's RideSharing_2_GetRide which books a cab. The required parameter is destination, which the user provided: 3236 Grand Avenue, Oakland. They mentioned \"most comfortable mode of travel,\" which might relate to ride_type. The function allows specifying ride_type, so I should use that. The parameters for RideSharing_2_GetRide are destination (required), number_of_seats (optional), and ride_type (optional). The user didn't specify seats, but maybe they want a ride that's comfortable, so perhaps suggesting a luxury or premium ride_type. However, the user hasn't explicitly stated the number of seats or the ride type. But since they mentioned \"most comfortable,\" I can infer they might want a higher comfort level. However, the function's ride_type parameter is optional, so maybe I should call the function with the destination and set ride_type to something like \"comfort\" or \"premium.\" Wait, the user hasn't specified the exact ride type, but the function allows it. Since the user is asking to start working through the request, I should at least book the ride with the destination and maybe suggest a comfortable ride type. But the parameters for ride_type aren't specified in the function's description, so maybe the user needs to choose. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle it without ride_type. But the user said \"most comfortable mode of travel would be appreciated,\" so I should include ride_type as \"comfort\" or similar. However, the function's ride_type parameter is a string, so I can set it to \"comfortable\" or whatever the system uses. Since the user hasn't specified the exact ride type, but wants comfort, I'll set ride_type to \"comfort\" or \"premium.\" But the function's parameters don't have a default, so I need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the ride booked with the destination, and the other parameters can be left out. But the user mentioned \"most comfortable,\" so it's better to include ride_type. Let me check the function's parameters again. The ride_type is optional. So I can call RideSharing_2_GetRide with destination and ride_type as \"comfort.\" But the exact value for ride_type isn't specified in the function's parameters, so maybe the user needs to input a valid ride type. However, the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available info. Wait, the user's message says \"the most comfortable mode of travel would be appreciated.\" So maybe the assistant should use that as the ride_type. But the function's ride_type parameter is a string, so the assistant can set it to \"comfortable\" or \"most comfortable.\" However, the function might expect specific values like \"luxury,\" \"standard,\" etc. Since the user hasn't specified, but wants the most comfortable, the assistant can set ride_type to \"luxury\" or \"premium.\" But without knowing the exact options, the assistant can use the user's wording. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should just book the ride with the destination and leave ride_type out, but the user's comment about comfort suggests including it. So the function call would be RideSharing_2_GetRide with destination \"3236 Grand Avenue, Oakland\" and ride_type \"comfortable.\" But the function's parameters don't specify allowed values, so the assistant can proceed with the user's input. Therefore, the correct function call is to use RideSharing_2_GetRide with the destination and ride_type as \"comfortable.\""}

The user wants two things: songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic' and tracks released around six years ago, considering the current year is 2023.\n\nFirst, for the first part, finding songs similar to 'The New Classic' album. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can be used here. The album parameter should be set to 'The New Classic'. Since the user wants similar songs, maybe the function's parameters that include artist, album, genre, and year can help. But the function's description says it finds songs based on those criteria. However, the user didn't specify an artist or genre, so I should set those to 'dontcare' to ignore them. But wait, the album is specified, so maybe just the album parameter is enough. But the function's parameters are all optional. So I can set album to 'The New Classic' and leave others as 'dontcare' to get similar songs based on that album.\n\nSecond part: tracks released around six years ago. Since the current year is 2023, six years ago would be 2017. So the year parameter should be 2017. But the user says \"around six years ago,\" so maybe a range? However, the function's year parameter expects a four-digit number. The user might mean exactly 2017, but maybe they want a few years around it. But the function can only take a single year. The user might have to specify a single year. Since the current year is 2023, six years prior is 2017. So set the year to 2017. But the function's year parameter is a string, so it's '2017'.\n\nSo I need to make two separate calls to Music_3_LookupMusic. The first one with album 'The New Classic' and others as 'dontcare'. The second one with year '2017' and others as 'dontcare'. Wait, but the user wants both: similar to the album and released around six years ago. So maybe combine both criteria in one call? Let me check the function parameters. The function allows multiple parameters. So in one call, set album to 'The New Classic' and year to '2017'. But the user might want songs similar to the album and also from around that time. However, the function's description says it finds songs based on the given criteria. So combining album and year might narrow it down. But the user's request is two separate things: similar to the album and released around six years ago. Maybe two separate function calls are better. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the first call is for similar songs to the album, which would use the album parameter. The second call is for songs from around 2017. So two separate calls. But the user might want both conditions applied. However, the function allows multiple parameters. So perhaps one call with album 'The New Classic' and year '2017' would get songs from that album released around 2017, but the user might want songs similar to the album's style and released around 2017. But the function's parameters are for filtering based on artist, album, genre, year. So if the user wants similar songs (which might involve genre or artist) but the function doesn't have a 'similar' parameter. The function's description says it finds songs that align with the user's preferences based on those criteria. So maybe using the album parameter would get songs from that album, but the user wants similar songs, which might require more info. However, given the available functions, the best approach is to use the album parameter for the first part and the year for the second. So two separate calls."}

There's the Events_3_FindEvents function. It requires event_type, city, and optionally a date. The user mentioned concerts or plays, so event_type could be \"concert\" or \"play\". The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. I need to call Events_3_FindEvents with these parameters. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The city should be \"Las Vegas, NV\" and the date as specified. The event_type might need to be a specific category, but the user said \"cultural events, like concerts or plays\", so maybe using \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate types or combining them. But the function's event_type is a single string. Maybe the user wants both, but the function might not support multiple types. Hmm, but the function's description says it lists cultural events, so perhaps the event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play\" individually. Since the user mentioned both, maybe I should check both. However, the function might not allow multiple types in one call. Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"cultural\" or something broader. Wait, the function's event_type is required, and the description says it's the category of the cultural event. So perhaps the user can specify \"concert\" or \"play\" as the event_type. Since the user is asking for both, maybe I need to make two separate calls. But the user might be okay with either. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle multiple types. But the function parameters only take a single string. So perhaps the best approach is to use \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate event_types. However, the user might not have specified which one, so maybe the function can handle a general category. Wait, the function's event_type is required, but the user is asking for both concerts and plays. Maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" and then \"play\" in separate calls. But the user might not want to split it. Alternatively, maybe the function allows a broader category. Let me check the function's description again. The description says \"cultural events, such as concerts and plays\", so maybe the event_type can be \"cultural\" or \"concert\" or \"play\". But the function's parameters require event_type as a string. Since the user is asking for both, perhaps the best approach is to use \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate event_types. However, the user might not have specified which one, so maybe the function can handle a general search. Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be left as \"cultural\" if that's an accepted value. But the function's parameters don't specify allowed values. Since the user is asking for concerts or plays, I'll use \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate event_types. But since the function can only take one event_type at a time, I might need to make two separate calls. However, the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept multiple types. But the parameters don't indicate that. So perhaps the best approach is to make two separate function calls for each event type. But the user's question is to find what cultural events are happening, which includes both. Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" and \"play\" combined, but that's not possible. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the function's event_type can be \"concert\" and the user can check for both. But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with using \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate event_types. However, the user might not have specified which one, so maybe the function can handle a general search. Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"cultural\" if that's an accepted value. But since the function's parameters don't specify allowed values, I'll proceed with \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate calls. But the user might not want that.

So including both parameters might narrow it down, but perhaps the function can handle that. Since the parameters are optional, I can include both album and year. But the user's request is to get songs from the album or from 2019. However, the function might not support OR logic between parameters. Wait, the function's description says \"match the user's specified preferences such as artist, album, genre, and release year.\" So if both album and year are provided, it would look for songs that match both, which might not be what the user wants. \n\nHmm, the user wants either the album or the year. But the function might not support OR between parameters. So maybe two separate calls are needed? But the user might be okay with a combination. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle it by setting one of the parameters. Wait, the user says \"or alternatively\", so maybe they want to get songs from the album, and if that's not available, then songs from 2019. But the function can't do that in one call. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is okay with getting songs that are either from the album or from 2019. But the function's parameters are AND-based. So if I include both album and year, it would return songs that are in the album and from 2019. Which might not be correct. \n\nWait, maybe the user wants to get songs from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. So two separate queries. But the assistant can only make one function call. So perhaps the best approach is to use the album parameter and set the year to 2019, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for either/or by using the parameters. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with getting songs from the album, and if that's not possible, then songs from 2019. But the function can't do that. So perhaps the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the user's question is a single request. \n\nWait, looking back at the function parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic, the parameters are optional. So if I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, the function would return songs that are in the album and from 2019. But the user wants either/or. So that's not correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the user intended to get songs from the album, and if that's not available, then songs from 2019. But the function can't handle that. So perhaps the assistant should first try to get songs from the album, and if that returns nothing, then get songs from 2019. But the assistant can only make one function call per turn. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to make one or more function calls. So maybe the assistant can make two separate calls. But the user's question is a single request. However, the system allows multiple function calls in the same turn. \n\nSo the correct approach would be to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and then, if that returns no results, call it again with year=2019. But the assistant can't know the results of the first call. So perhaps the assistant should make both calls in parallel. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should make the function calls based on the user's question. Since the user says \"or alternatively\", the assistant can make two separate function calls: one for the album and one for the year. \n\nBut the user might be okay with either. So the assistant should make both calls. However, the system might not allow that. Wait, the user's question is to \"hear a track from the album 'High Expectations', or alternatively, any song that came out in 2019.\" So the user wants to get either one. So the assistant can make two separate function calls: one to look up the album and another to look up songs from 2019. \n\nBut the assistant can only make one function call per turn. Wait, the problem says \"you can make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\" So the assistant can make multiple function calls in the same response. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call Music_3_LookupMusic twice: once with album='High Expectations' and once with year=2019. \n\nBut looking at the parameters, the function allows for multiple parameters. However, if the user wants either/or, then two separate calls are needed. \n\nSo the answer would be two function calls: one with album set to 'High Expectations' and another with year set to 2019. \n\nBut the assistant needs to check if the parameters are correctly set. For the first call, set album to 'High Expectations' and leave year as 'dontcare'. For the second call, set year to 2019 and leave album as 'dontcare'. \n\nWait, the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic have the artist, album, genre, and year as optional. The description says to use 'dontcare' if not specified. So for the first call, to get songs from the album, set album to 'High Expectations' and set the other parameters (artist, genre, year) to 'dontcare'. For the second call, set year to 2019 and set the other parameters to 'dontcare'. \n\nBut the user's request is to get either, so the assistant can make both calls. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n<function name=\"Music_3_LookupMusic\">\n  <param name=\"album\" type=\"string\">High Expectations</param>\n  <param name=\"artist\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n  <param name=\"genre\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n  <param name=\"year\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n</function>\n<function name=\"Music_3_LookupMusic\">\n  <param name=\"album\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n  <param name=\"artist\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n  <param name=\"genre\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n  <param name=\"year\" type=\"string\">2019</param>\n</function>\n\nBut the user might not need to set all the other parameters to 'dontcare' if they are optional. However, the function's parameters are optional, and the description says to use 'dontcare' if not specified. So to ensure that the other parameters don't affect the search, they should be set to 'dontcare'. \n\nAlternatively, if the parameters are not provided, the function might default to 'dontcare'. But the problem says that the parameters are required as false, so they can be omitted. However, the description says to use 'dontcare' if not specified. So perhaps the assistant should include them. \n\nBut the user's question doesn't mention artist, genre, so those can be set to 'dontcare'. \n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are as above."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe Events_3_FindEvents function seems relevant here. It retrieves cultural events based on event type, city, and date. The parameters required are event_type, city, and optionally date. The user specified \"music concert or a play\" as the event type, so I can use that. The city is New York, and the date is March 10th, which should be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' so '2023-03-10' assuming the current year. \n\nWait, the date parameter in Events_3_FindEvents has a default of 'dontcare' if not specified, but the user wants a specific date. So I need to set the date to '2023-03-10'. The event_type should be 'concert' or 'play', but the user said \"music concert or a play\", so maybe use 'concert' and 'play' as separate types? But the function's event_type is a single string. Maybe the function allows multiple types, but the parameter is required. Hmm, the description says \"category of the cultural event to find\", so perhaps the user can input 'concert' or 'play' as the event_type. Since the user wants either, maybe I should call the function twice, once for each type. But the function might handle multiple types if separated by commas? The parameter's type is string, so maybe it's a single value. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle multiple event types in one call. The user's query says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so perhaps the event_type can be 'concert' and 'play' as separate parameters. Wait, but the function only takes one event_type.

The user provided all these: Austin, TX, 4 adults, check-in on 05/12/2023, check-out on 05/18/2023. So I can use this function directly. Wait, but maybe they need to search first? The Hotels_2_SearchHouse is for searching, but the user already knows they want to book. However, the booking function might need the house details, but the parameters don't include a house ID. Hmm, maybe the booking function is designed to book based on the criteria, but the parameters don't have a house identifier. Wait, looking at the parameters again: the BookHouse function's parameters are where_to, number_of_adults, check_in, check_out. So it seems like it's booking based on those parameters, perhaps selecting the first available or a specific one. But the user hasn't specified a particular house, so maybe they need to search first. Wait, but the user's message says they need to book, so maybe they already have a house in mind. However, the functions don't have a way to specify a particular house, so maybe the BookHouse function is intended to be used after a search. But the user hasn't mentioned searching, so perhaps the assistant should first search for available houses and then book. However, the user's request is to book, so maybe the assistant should proceed to book using the given parameters. But the problem is that the BookHouse function might require the house to be available, but the parameters don't include a house ID. Maybe the function is designed to book based on the criteria, but the system would handle the availability. Since the user hasn't provided a house ID, but the parameters for BookHouse don't require it, perhaps the function is intended to be used directly.

But the date_of_journey parameter in Trains_1_GetTrainTickets is for the date of the journey, not the start date. Wait, the description says \"date of the train journey\" which might be the date of the trip, but the journey_start_time is the time on that date. However, the user says \"starting at one day before,\" which might mean the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is given as May 15. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, and the start time is on that date. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the journey to be on May 15, but the start time is one day before, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe they meant the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before the journey date, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Perhaps the user intended the journey to start on May 15, but the start time is, say, 10:00 AM. However, the user didn't specify the exact time. The function requires journey_start_time in HH:MM format. Since the user hasn't provided that, we can't proceed. Also, the date_of_journey is required as 'YYYY-MM-DD', so May 15, 2023 would be '2023-05-15'. But the user mentioned \"starting at one day before,\" which might be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which doesn't make sense. This is unclear. However, the function Trains_1_GetTrainTickets requires the journey_start_time, which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, the parameters are missing. The user hasn't given the exact time, so we can't call the function. Also, the number_of_adults is 4, trip_protection is true, and _class is business. But without the journey_start_time, the function can't be called. So the answer would be that the required parameters are missing."}

But the user wants a good reputation, so perhaps setting avg_rating to 4.0 would be better. However, since the user didn't specify a number, maybe it's safer to not assume and let the system handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function can filter by avg_rating if provided. The user didn't mention a specific rating, so maybe leave it out. Also, service_id for cleaning service is needed. The example says service_id 1 is cleaning, so set service_id to 1.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user ID is given, so I can use that. But the description mentions shareable tokens, which might be a subset of all tokens.\n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function. It has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe set include_expired to true. However, the function doesn't mention a user_id parameter. Wait, the parameters listed don't include user_id. That's a problem because the user provided their ID. But the function's parameters don't have a user_id field. Maybe the API uses authentication to determine the user, so the user_id isn't needed here. But the user provided it, so perhaps the first function is the right one. However, the first function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not be all tokens. The second function's description says \"associated with the user's account,\" which sounds more comprehensive. But if the second function doesn't require user_id, maybe it's handled via authentication. The user might have provided the user ID for the first function. But the user is insistent on getting all tokens. Maybe I should use the second function with include_expired=true and page=1, page_size=100 to get as many as possible. However, the user ID isn't a parameter here. Maybe the user ID is part of the authentication, so the function doesn't need it. But the user provided it, so perhaps the first function is the correct one. But the first function's description says \"shareable,\" which might not include all. The user might need both? But the user said \"ALL API TOKENS,\" so maybe the second function is better. However, the second function's parameters don't include user_id. Maybe the user ID is not required because the API is already authenticated. So, the user provided the user ID, but the function doesn't need it. So, I should call the second function with include_expired=true, page=1, and page_size=100 to get all tokens. But if there are more than 100, the user might need to paginate. But the user said \"now,\" so maybe just the first page. Alternatively, the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=true. But which one gives all tokens? The second function's description says \"associated with the user's account,\" which sounds more comprehensive. But without the user_id parameter, how is the user identified? Maybe the user ID is part of the authentication token, so the function doesn't need it. Therefore, the correct call is to use the second function with include_expired=true to get all tokens, regardless of expiration. But the user might need to handle pagination. However, the user is demanding all tokens now, so maybe the first page with max size. So, the function call would be get_api_tokens with include_expired=true, page=1, page_size=100. But the user ID is 12345, but the function doesn't take it. Maybe the user ID is not needed here. So, proceed with that."}

So, I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' which requires the type of experience or education and the name. The user specified \"education\" and the university name. So maybe that's the right function. The parameters are 'experience_or_education_type' and 'experience_or_education_name'. \n\nWait, the 'detail_experience_and_education' function's description says it retrieves detailed info about Adriel's professional experiences and educational background. The parameters require the type (like internship, freelance, or education) and the name. Since the user is asking about education at UNS, I should set the type to \"education\" and the name to \"Universitas Sebelas Maret\".\n\nAlternatively, there's the 'experiences_and_education' function, but that seems to list experiences and education with parameters like person_id, include_experiences, include_education, etc. But the user is asking for specific details about a particular education, not a list.

The available functions are set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for a specific time reminder, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for durations, which doesn't fit here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for set_alarm: alarm_time is required. The user specified \"7:00 AM\" and the date is tomorrow, which is 2023-12-01. So the alarm_time should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or a 12-hour format with AM/PM. Since the date is provided, combining it with the time would be better. So the alarm_time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. Alternatively, since the user mentioned \"tomorrow\", but the date is already given as 2023-12-01, maybe that's the correct date. Wait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Probably a typo for \"tomorrow\". So the date is December 1st, which is tomorrow. So the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'.\n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, but the user mentioned it's for a meeting, so adding purpose as 'meeting' would be helpful. \n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'meeting'."}
