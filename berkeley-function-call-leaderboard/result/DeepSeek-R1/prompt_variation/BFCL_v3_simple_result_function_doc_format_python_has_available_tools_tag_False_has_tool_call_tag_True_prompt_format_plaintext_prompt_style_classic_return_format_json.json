The user didn't say to avoid ferries, but also didn't say to include them. \n The problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n However, the avoid parameter is optional and has a default. We are allowed to override the default.\n\n We have two choices:\n   Option 1: Use the default and add 'toll roads'.

But note the function's default already avoids ferries. \n The user might not want to avoid ferries? But the function by default avoids ferries. \n\n However, the user's request is about avoiding highways and toll roads. We should respect the user's explicit request and also note that the function's default might avoid more than the user wants? \n\n But the problem says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\n The purpose is to get directions avoiding highways and toll roads. We are not instructed to avoid ferries, but if the user didn't specify, we can leave the default? \n However, the user might not care about ferries. Since the function defaults to avoiding ferries, and the user didn't say to remove that, we can keep it.\n\n Alternatively, we could interpret that the user only wants to avoid highways and toll roads and does not care about ferries? But the function default is to avoid ferries. \n\n Let me re-read the function description: it says \"including options for route preferences\". The avoid parameter is for specifying what to avoid.\n\n Considering the requirement: the user said \"avoiding highways and toll roads\". That means we must avoid at least those two. \n The function's default also avoids ferries. So if we call the function with avoid=['highways','toll roads'] then we are missing the default 'ferries'. \n But note: the function has a default of ['highways','ferries']. If we provide the avoid parameter, we are overriding the default. \n\n How should we handle this? \n We have two options:\n   a) We set avoid to the list of what the user said: ['highways', 'toll roads'] -> then we are not avoiding ferries? But the user didn't say to avoid ferries, so maybe that's acceptable?\n   b) We set avoid to the default and add 'toll roads': avoid = ['highways','ferries','toll roads'] \n\n Since the user did not specify about ferries, we can either leave it to the default or not. But note: the function's default is to avoid ferries. \n However, if we override the avoid parameter, we are replacing the entire list. So if we set avoid=['highways','toll roads'], then we are not avoiding ferries? \n\n The problem says: the function has a default of ['highways','ferries'].\n\n Therefore, to meet the user's request and preserve the default for ferries (since the user didn't say anything about ferries, we assume we keep the default behavior), we must include ferries as well? \n\n But wait, the user might not want to avoid ferries? We don't know. \n\n However, the instruction: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n But the avoid parameter is not required because it has a default. So we are allowed to set it to what we want.\n\n Considering the user's explicit request: avoid highways and toll roads. We should avoid exactly those? \n But note: the function's default also avoids ferries. If the user doesn't want to avoid ferries, then we should not avoid ferries? \n However, the user didn't say. \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the function by default avoids ferries, it is safe to assume that the user is okay with the default? \n But the user's request is about avoiding two specific things. We are not told to change the default for ferries.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   avoid = ['highways', 'ferries', 'toll roads']\n\n But wait, the function's default is ['highways','ferries']. We are adding 'toll roads'. \n\n However, the user did not say to avoid ferries, but they also did not say to include ferries. We are including ferries because we are adding to the default? \n Actually, we are overriding the entire avoid list. We are not adding to the default. We are replacing the default with our list.\n\n How can we avoid exactly what the user said plus the default? We cannot because we don't know if the user wants the default or not.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the function's default is to avoid ferries, and the user didn't specify, we can follow the principle: \n   - The user explicitly said avoid highways and toll roads. We should avoid those. \n   - We are not told to avoid ferries, so we should not avoid ferries? But note: the user didn't say to avoid ferries, so we don't know.\n\n Alternatively, we can stick to the user's explicit request and set avoid to ['highways','toll roads'] and drop the ferries? \n\n However, the problem says: \"Based on the question\". The question only mentions avoiding highways and toll roads. \n\n Therefore, we set avoid to exactly what the user said: ['highways','toll roads'].\n\n But note: the function's default avoids ferries. If we set avoid=['highways','toll roads'], then we are not avoiding ferries? \n So the route might include ferries? That might be acceptable because the user didn't say to avoid ferries.\n\n However, the user might be surprised if the route includes ferries? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we are to base on the question, we go with what the user said.\n\n So:\n   start: \"New York\"\n   end: \"Los Angeles\"\n   avoid: [\"highways\", \"toll roads\"]\n\n But note: the function expects a list of strings. The avoid parameter is a list. \n\n Also, the function expects the avoid list to contain only the features it knows. We are using \"highways\" and \"toll roads\", which are standard.\n\n Let's write the function call:\n\n [{\n   \"function\": \"map_service.get_directions\",\n   \"parameters\": {\n        \"start\": \"New York\",\n        \"end\": \"Los Angeles\",\n        \"avoid\": [\"highways\", \"toll roads\"]\n   }\n }]\n\n However, note that the function definition says avoid is a list and the default is ['highways','ferries'].\n\n But the user did not mention ferries, so we are not including ferries. \n\n Alternatively, we could note that the user only said \"avoiding highways and toll roads\", meaning that we are to avoid those two and we don't care about the rest? \n So we set avoid to the two items.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n\n But wait: what if the system expects the default to be preserved?

But note the function defaults to 'all' so we can skip.\n\n However, note: the work title might be more precisely known as \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) where the law was first published. But the user says \"law of universal gravitation\", which is a concept. We might try with the common title.\n\n But the function expects the title of the scientific work. The law was published in the book \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\". However, the user might not know that. We have two options:\n   Option 1: Use the exact title of the book if we know it.\n   Option 2: Use the user's phrase.\n\n Since the function might not recognize the concept name but the actual book title, we should use the actual book title. But note: the function's documentation doesn't specify that it only accepts exact titles. It might be designed to handle common names too.\n\n However, without knowing the capabilities of the function, we must rely on the parameters. The function expects the work_title. We can try with the common name first? But if the function is based on a database that uses formal titles, then we might need the formal title.\n\n Let's consider: the user's question uses the phrase \"law of universal gravitation\". But the publication that introduced it is the \"Principia\". We can try:\n\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n But note: the function might not have non-ASCII characters? We might use an English version: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n\n Alternatively, we can try with the common name of the law? However, the function is for the publication year of a work, not a law. So we should use the work title.\n\n However, the user might have provided the concept because they don't know the exact title. But we have to use the function as defined.\n\n Since the function's purpose is to get the publication year of a scientific work, and the work that contains the law is the \"Principia\", we should use that.\n\n But note: the function might be able to handle common names? We don't know. We have to make an informed choice.\n\n Let's try with the exact title of the book: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n However, if the function's database uses the English title, we might use: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n\n But to be safe, we can try both? But we can only call once per function in one toolcall? Actually, we can make multiple calls in one TOOLCALL block? The format allows an array of function calls.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at each turn\" we should try to complete the task. We can make multiple function calls in one turn? The instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ...\" and the example has an array.\n\n So we can try two calls? One with the Latin title and one with the English? But that might be inefficient and the function might not have both.\n\n Alternatively, we can try one call with the most common title. The book is most commonly known by its short title \"Principia\". But the function might require the full title.\n\n We don't have information on how the function works internally.\n\n Since the user said \"law of universal gravitation\", we can also try:\n\n   work_title: \"law of universal gravitation\"\n\n But note: that is not a book title, it's a law. The function is for a scientific work (which is a publication). So we should use the book title.\n\n Given the above, I will use:\n\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n But note: the function might not have non-ASCII characters. We can use the ASCII version: \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n However, the function might be able to handle it. But to be safe, we can also try the English title in a separate call? But the problem says we can do multiple calls in one TOOLCALL.\n\n Alternatively, we can try one call and if it fails, then we try the other? But in the same turn? The instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" But in the same response, we can only output one TOOLCALL block? Actually, the example format allows multiple function calls in one block.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But we have the parameters.\n\n Since we are not sure which title will work, we can try two:\n\n   Call 1: author: \"Isaac Newton\", work_title: \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n   Call 2: author: \"Isaac Newton\", work_title: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n\n But note: the function might return the same result for both? Or it might not.\n\n Alternatively, we can try with the common short title \"Principia\"? But the function might require the full title.\n\n However, we have to make a decision.\n\n Considering the user's question, the most direct approach is to use the common name of the book: \"Principia\". But the function doesn't specify if it can handle short names.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will try:\n\n   Call 1: author: \"Isaac Newton\", work_title: \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n If that doesn't work in the system (meaning if the function returns nothing), then we might have to try again in the next turn? But we are only allowed one TOOLCALL per turn? Actually, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until ...\" and then the system will proceed.\n\n So we can only output one TOOLCALL block per turn. But we can include multiple function calls in that block? Yes, the format is an array.\n\n Therefore, I will do two function calls in one TOOLCALL block.\n\n However, note: the function does not take multiple titles at once. We have to make two separate function calls.\n\n So:\n\n   [\n     {\n        \"function\": \"publication_year.find\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"author\": \"Isaac Newton\",\n            \"work_title\": \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n        }\n     },\n     {\n        \"function\": \"publication_year.find\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"author\": \"Isaac Newton\",\n            \"work_title\": \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n        }\n     }\n   ]\n\n But wait, what if the function can return multiple matches? Then we might get two results? But the user only wants the year for the law of universal gravitation, which is in the Principia. So we expect the same year for both? Actually, they are the same book.\n\n Alternatively, we could try with the short title:\n\n        \"work_title\": \"Principia\"\n\n That might be the most common.\n\n However, to be safe, let's try the two most common full titles.\n\n But note: the function might be case-sensitive? We don't know. We can use the exact case as known.\n\n Also, the author: \"Isaac Newton\" is standard.\n\n However, the function might have variations? We don't know.\n\n Considering the above, I will call the function twice: once with the Latin title and once with the English title.\n\n But note: the function might be designed to handle both. We don't know. We are doing our best.\n\n Alternatively, we can try one call with the Latin title and if that fails, then in the next turn we try the English? But we are to do as much as we can in one turn.\n\n Since we can do multiple function calls in one TOOLCALL, I will do two.\n\n But note: the system might run both and return both results. Then we can pick the one that returns a year? And if both return, then they should be the same.\n\n So I will do two function calls.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have both parameters for each call.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"publication_year.find\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"author\": \"Isaac Newton\",\n      \"work_title\": \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"publication_year.find\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"author\": \"Isaac Newton\",\n      \"work_title\": \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function name is \"publication_year.find\", not \"publication_year.find\" (typo above). Correction: the function name is exactly as given: \"publication_year.find\"\n\n Also, the Latin title: we removed the diacritics to be safe? We can use the original with diacritics? The function might handle it. But the problem says we are composing functions and we don't know the implementation. We'll use the version without diacritics for safety? Or with?\n\n The original title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" has the character '\u00e6'. We can represent it as \"ae\" to be safe? But let's try to use the exact title. The function might be able to handle Unicode.\n\n However, the instruction does not specify. We'll use the exact title as known? But we are not sure. We can use the version without the special character: replace '\u00e6' with 'ae'. So \"Philosophiae\" instead of \"Philosophi\u00e6\".\n\n But note: in the function call, we are writing JSON, which supports Unicode. So we can use the original.\n\n However, to be safe and because the function might have the title without diacritics, we can use:\n\n   \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n without the ligature.\n\n So:\n\n   work_title: \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n Alternatively, we can use both? But that would be a third call? We are already doing two.\n\n Let's stick to two calls: one with the Latin without ligature and one with the English.\n\n Therefore, the final call is as above.\n\n Note: We are not including the 'location' parameter because it is optional and we don't have it.\n\n Let's output the TOOLCALL block accordingly."}

So we'll use \"Manhattan\" as the location because that is the center of the request.\n\n Actually, let's reconsider: the function parameter is described as \"The city where you want to book the hotel\". Manhattan is not a city, but a part of New York City. The city is New York. So we should use \"New York\".\n\n But note: the user might expect the hotel to be in Manhattan. However, the function doesn't allow for specifying a borough. We have to rely on the system to interpret \"New York\" and then filter by being near Manhattan? That might be beyond the function's control.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location? The function doesn't specify the format. We can try to pass a more specific string. Let's pass \"Manhattan, New York\" to be more precise.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact format of the location, and we want to be as specific as possible, we'll use \"Manhattan, New York\".\n\n However, if the function expects just a city name, then we might use \"New York\". But the description says \"city\", and New York is a city. But note that the function might be designed to take a city and state or a more specific location. Since the example doesn't specify, we'll use the format that includes the borough and city: \"Manhattan, New York\".\n\n Alternatively, we can check if the function's design allows for such a string. Since we don't have more context, we'll assume that the system can handle it.\n\n Another point: the preferences list. We are given one preference: pet friendly. So we'll set preferences to ['pet friendly'].\n\n Therefore, the function call will be:\n   function: \"hotel_booking\"\n   parameters: \n        location: \"Manhattan, New York\"\n        room_type: \"single\"\n        duration: 3\n        start_date: \"2023-03-10\"\n        preferences: [\"pet friendly\"]\n\n But note: the function expects the start_date as a string. We are formatting the date as \"YYYY-MM-DD\", which is a common format.\n\n Let's write the tool call accordingly."}
