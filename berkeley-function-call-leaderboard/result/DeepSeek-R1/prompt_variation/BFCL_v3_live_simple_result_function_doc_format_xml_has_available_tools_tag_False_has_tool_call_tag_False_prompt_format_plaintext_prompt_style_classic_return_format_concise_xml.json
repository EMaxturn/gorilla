However, the base path might be fixed.\n\n We are instructed to use the base URL without query parameters and then pass the parameters as a dictionary in the `params` argument.\n\n Let's construct the URL and the parameters:\n\n   URL: 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\n   Parameters (as a dict):\n     fabricName: 'Network1'\n     nodeId: 12 (should be integer? but the function expects the type as per the parameter, and the function parameter type is dict, so we can put integer)\n     podId: 10 (integer)\n     interfaceType: 'Ethernet'\n     infoType: 'Speed'\n\n However, note that the function expects the `params` to be a dictionary.

In XML, we need to escape the double quotes or use a single quote inside?\n Actually, in XML, we can use double quotes inside the value by escaping them as &quot; but that is not necessary because we are putting the string in a CDATA section?\n Alternatively, we can wrap the entire command in single quotes? But the function expects a string and the command is a string.\n\n However, note the function description: it uses os.system() on Windows. The command must be properly formatted.\n\n But in the XML we are writing, we are going to put the command as the value of the param. We can use the double quotes inside the string without escaping if we wrap the attribute value in single quotes? Actually, no, because the param value is inside an XML tag. We can use:\n\n <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"</param>\n\n But note: the double quotes inside the string might break the XML. Therefore, we should escape the inner double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;</param>\n\n However, the function call format does not require CDATA and escaping with &quot; is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the filter? But the tasklist command expects double quotes.\n\n Actually, the command works with double quotes. So we must preserve them.\n\n Therefore, we will write the command string with the double quotes escaped as &quot;.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"</param>\n\n But this would cause the XML to be invalid because the inner quotes are not escaped.\n\n How about:\n\n <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\"><![CDATA[tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"]]></param>\n\n However, the format does not specify CDATA. So we should escape.\n\n Therefore, we will use:\n\n command = 'tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"' -> but in XML, we escape the inner double quotes as &quot;\n\n So the command string becomes: `tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;`\n\n But note: the function expects the command exactly as it would be run. The escaping is only for XML.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the outer attribute and then we can have double quotes inside without escaping? \n\n However, in the function call XML, the parameter value is inside an element, not an attribute. So we don't have to worry about the outer quotes. The element content can contain double quotes without being escaped? Actually, no. In XML, the content of an element can contain double quotes without escaping? Actually, yes, because the element content is not parsed for attribute quotes. Only the special characters like <, >, &, and \" in attributes must be escaped. But when the string is in the element content, we can use double quotes without escaping? Actually, we must escape the ampersand and the less than, but the double quotes are okay? However, to be safe, we can escape the double quotes.\n\n But note: the problem says we must output in the specified format. The format does not specify how to escape. However, since we are generating XML, we must follow XML escaping rules.\n\n Therefore, we escape the double quotes inside the string as &quot;.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid escaping by using:\n\n The entire string doesn't contain any < or > or & (except in the command, but the command doesn't have them). So we can write:\n\n <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"</param>\n\n But wait, the XML parser will see the double quote inside and it's okay? Because the element content is just text. The only issue is if we have a character that is special in XML, like the ampersand. The command does not have an ampersand? Actually, it does: the `&` in `&&` for multiple commands? But in our command, we don't have an ampersand? Our command is: `tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"` -> no ampersand.\n\n However, the problem says: for multiple commands, separate with '&&'. But our command is a single command.\n\n So we can write the command without escaping? Actually, the double quotes in the element content are fine.\n\n But to be safe and consistent, I will escape the double quotes. Why? Because if the command had an ampersand, it would break. But in this case it doesn't.\n\n However, let's do it without escaping and see if it breaks? Actually, the problem says: the type must be one of the given, and we are providing a string. The XML should be well-formed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;</param>\n\n This is safe.\n\n I will choose to escape the double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the filter? The tasklist command accepts single quotes? Let me check: in Windows command line, the filter must be in double quotes. So we must use double quotes.\n\n Therefore, we escape the double quotes.\n\n But note: the function call is being generated as XML, so we must escape.\n\n Alternatively, we can wrap the entire string in single quotes? No, because the command requires double quotes.\n\n So:\n\n We are going to set the command to: `tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;`\n\n However, when the function receives it, it will unescape and become: `tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"` which is correct.\n\n But note: the function expects a string. The unescaping is done by the XML parser. So the function will get the string exactly as we intended.\n\n Alternatively, if we don't escape, the XML might break.\n\n Therefore, we escape.\n\n But wait: the function call is written as:\n\n <function name=\"cmd_controller.execute\">\n   <param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;</param>\n </function>\n\n However, note that the function's parameter is named `command` (with a 'd') and we are writing `command` in the param name? Yes.\n\n But note: the function parameter is defined as:\n   <param name=\"command\" ...>\n\n So we are using the correct name.\n\n Therefore, the function call is:"}
