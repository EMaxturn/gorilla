The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics function for displacement.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters are all integers except maybe acceleration and time, but the function expects integers. Wait, the parameters for 'calculate_displacement' specify initial_speed, acceleration, and time as integers. But the user provided 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. Those are all integers, so that's good. The rounding is optional with a default of 2 decimals. \n\nSo I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. The rounding isn't specified, so I can omit it or use the default. The function should handle that. Let me make sure all required parameters are there. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, time are required. So the function call should include those three. \n\nI don't need to use the other function, calculate_final_speed, because the question is about displacement, not final speed.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified the US, I don't need to adjust the region. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. \n\nWait, but the question mentions \"cheapest\". Does the function return the lowest price or the current price? The description says \"selling price\", which might just be the current price. However, since there's no other function that checks sales or discounts, maybe the store_price function will return the discounted price if it's on sale. The user might be implying that the cheapest price is the sale price. \n\nAlternatively, there's the video_games.on_sale function to check if it's on sale. But the user isn't asking if it's on sale, just the cheapest price. So maybe I should first check if it's on sale using on_sale, and if it is, then get the price from store_price. But the user wants the cheapest, which could be the sale price. However, the functions available don't mention historical prices or comparing prices. \n\nGiven the functions provided, the best approach is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region. That should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available unless there's a sale. But since the user didn't specify checking sales, maybe the store_price function already returns the lowest possible price. \n\nSo the correct function to call is video_games.store_price with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', and region 'United States'. The region is optional and defaults to US, but since the user specified it, I'll include it. \n\nI don't need to call any other functions because the store_price function should provide the necessary information. The on_sale function would just confirm if there's a sale, but the user wants the price, not the sale status. So the answer is to call store_price with the given parameters."}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are two functions provided. The first one is calculate_acceleration, which needs initial_speed, final_speed, time, and optionally distance. The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which requires distance and time, and initial_speed is optional with a default of 0. \n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. The parameters needed are distance and time. The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (default 0). The user's input matches those parameters. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_acceleration here because the question is directly asking for the speed, not the acceleration. The second function is more straightforward for this scenario. Let me make sure I'm not missing any parameters. The required ones are distance and time, which are provided.

The first sample is 2 moles at 300 K, and the second is 3 moles at 400 K. \n\nHmm, I remember that when gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacities should be the same, so the formula simplifies to (q1 + q2) = 0, where q is quantity times temperature change. But since the quantities are in moles, maybe it's (n1*T1 + n2*T2) divided by total moles?\n\nWait, the function provided is calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. All integers. The user provided all these values: 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K. So I just need to plug those numbers into the function. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_mass here because the problem is about mixing temperatures, not mass.
