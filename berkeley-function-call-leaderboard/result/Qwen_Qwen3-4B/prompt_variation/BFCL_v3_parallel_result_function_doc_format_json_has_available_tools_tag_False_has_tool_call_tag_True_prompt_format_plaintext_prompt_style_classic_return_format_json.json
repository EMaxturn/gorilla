The user wants to find two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function provided is find_movie_showing. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are location, movie, and time. The location is a string like \"San Diego, CA\". The movie is an array of strings from a specific enum: ['Tenet', 'No Time To Die']. The time is an array of strings, which are show times.\n\nThe user specified San Diego, so the location is \"San Diego, CA\". The movies they want are Tenet and No Time To Die. The times are 5 pm and 7:30 pm. Wait, the time parameter is an array of strings. So I need to include both times for each movie? Or is the time parameter per movie?\n\nLooking at the function's parameters again: the time is an array of show times for each movie. Wait, the description says \"Show time for each movie\". So maybe each movie has its own time. But the user is asking for both movies with specific times. So perhaps the time array should include both 5 pm and 7:30 pm. But the function's time parameter is an array of strings. So maybe the user wants to check availability for both movies at those times. But the function's parameters require that the time is an array of strings. So the user is asking for two different times, so the time array would be [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"].\n\nWait, but the movie parameter is an array of the movies. So the function would need to be called with location: \"San Diego, CA\", movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"].\n\nBut the function's parameters require that the time is an array of strings. So the user's request is to find theatres showing both movies at those times. However, the function might return theatres that show both movies at those times. But the user is asking for two theatres. The function's description says \"Find local movie theatres and their schedule for a specific movie\". Wait, the description says \"for a specific movie\", but the parameters have an array for movie. Hmm, maybe the function can handle multiple movies. But the user is asking for two theatres, each showing both movies at those times? Or two theatres in total, each with availability for the two movies at those times?\n\nThe function's parameters require location, movie (array of the two movies), and time (array of the two times). So the function call would be with those parameters. The function's response would then return the theatres that have those showings. The user wants two theatres, so the function should return that information. Therefore, the correct function call is to use find_movie_showing with the given parameters."}

Wait, the function's date parameter is a string, but does it need to be a specific date or can it be a relative date like \"next Friday\"? The description says \"the date on which the user wants to attend,\" so maybe \"next Friday\" is acceptable. However, sometimes APIs require specific dates. But since the user specified \"next Friday,\" I'll use that as the date.\n\nGenre is classical. The user specified \"classical concerts.\" So genre parameter is \"classical\".\n\nAmenities: the user is interested only in those with available parking. The default is parking, so maybe the amenities array should include parking. But the user says \"only\" parking, so maybe we need to set amenities to [\"Parking\"] explicitly.

Let me check the second part: \"Please also find the highest common factor of the pair (36, 48) and then find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96).\" So, similar structure: HCF(36,48) \u2192 result Y, then HCF(Y, 72, 96). Again, since HCF is between two numbers, perhaps HCF(Y, 72) and HCF(Y, 96). But the user says \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96)\", which again is ambiguous.

The location parameter is required, so each call will have the city and state. The operating_hours should be 22 for all three. Let me check if the function can handle multiple calls. Since the user asked for all three cities, I should make three separate function calls. Each will have the respective location and operating_hours set to 22.
