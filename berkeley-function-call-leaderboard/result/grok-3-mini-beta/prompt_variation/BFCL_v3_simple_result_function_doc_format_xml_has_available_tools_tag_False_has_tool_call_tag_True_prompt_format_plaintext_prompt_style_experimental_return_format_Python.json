The example says: \"if 11 is given, then restaurants that close at or after 11 PM\".\n\nPerhaps they mean the input is the hour in 12-hour format but interpreted as PM? That would be odd.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe \"11\" means 11:00, and they specify PM in the example, but that contradicts.\n\nLet's assume based on the example: if the user wants at least 11 PM, I should pass 11 as per the example.\n\nThe description: \"E.g. if 11 is given, then restaurants that close at or after 11 PM will be considered.\"\n\nSo, for 11 PM, pass 11.\n\nThat might be how it's defined for this tool.

They've given: invested $5000, annual return rate of 7%, and time period of 5 years.\n\nI have a function called \"investment.predictProfit\" that matches this. It predicts the profit for a given investment after a specified number of years.\n\nLet me check the parameters for this function:\n\n- investment_amount: type integer, required. User provided $5000, which is an integer.\n\n- annual_return: type float, required. User provided 7%, which I can interpret as 7.0 (a float).\n\n- years: type integer, required. User provided 5 years.\n\nAll required parameters are present in the user's query.\n\nThe function description is: \"Predict the profit for given investment after specified number of years.\" This seems to fit perfectly.\n\nI need to format my response as a TOOLCALL. The exact format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, it would be: <TOOLCALL>[investment.predictProfit(investment_amount=5000, annual_return=7.0, years=5)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nAnnual return is given as 7%, which is 7 percent. In finance, return rates are often decimals (e.g., 0.07 for 7%), but the function parameter is described as \"The annual return rate of the investment.\" and it's a float. I need to confirm if it expects a percentage or a decimal.\n\nLooking back: \"annual_return\" type=\"float\", and desc=\"The annual return rate of the investment.\" It doesn't specify if it's in percentage or decimal form. In standard financial calculations, it's often a decimal (e.g., 0.07 for 7%). However, the user said \"7%\", so to be precise, I should use 7.0 if it's meant as a percentage, but I think the function likely expects it as a decimal.\n\nThe function is called \"predictProfit\", and in the params, it's just \"annual_return\" as a float. To be safe, I'll assume it's in decimal form, as that's common in programming for rates. But the user said \"7%\", which might imply 7 as the value.\n\nIn the human message: \"annual return rate is 7%\". In the function, it's probably expecting 0.07. But the description doesn't specify. To avoid errors, I should use it as provided, but since it's a rate, I'll convert it to decimal.\n\nIn the function params, it's just a float, and the user said 7%, so perhaps the function expects the percentage as is. But that might not be standard. For example, in compound interest formulas, it's usually a decimal.\n\nTo be precise, I should pass it as 7.0, and let the function handle it. But I think it's safer to assume it's a percentage and pass 7.0, meaning 7%.\n\nUpon second thought, in many APIs, if it's called \"annual_return\", it could be either. But looking at the function name and context, I'll go with 7.0 as the user stated \"7%\".\n\nPerhaps I should pass it exactly as 7, since they said 7%.\n\nThe param description: \"The annual return rate of the investment.\" No specification.\n\nTo match the user's input, I'll use 7.0 for annual_return.\n\nInvestment_amount is 5000, which is an integer.\n\nYears is 5, integer.\n\nSo, the call should be: investment.predictProfit(investment_amount=5000, annual_return=7.0, years=5)\n\nAfter making this call, if I need more information, I can continue, but this seems to fulfill the request.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

To be safe, I'll assume it's in decimal form, as that's common in programming for interest calculations.\n\nThe user said \"annual interest rate of 5%\", which typically means 5 percent, so 0.05.\n\nIn the function params, it's a float, and no unit is specified, but in the human message, it's \"5%\", so I need to convert it.\n\nUpon second thought, in many APIs, you pass it as the percentage value, and the function handles the conversion. But to be accurate, I should pass it as 5.0 if that's how it's expected, but I think it's safer to pass 0.05.\n\nThe function is called \"calculate_compounded_interest\", and the formula for compounded interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where r is the annual interest rate as a decimal.\n\nSo, probably, the function expects r as a decimal, like 0.05.\n\nBut the description doesn't specify. To avoid errors, I'll pass it as 0.05.\n\nIn the human message: \"annual interest rate of 5%\", and in the function, it's \"The annual interest rate.\", so I'll convert it to 0.05.\n\nOkay, so parameters:\n\n- principal: 5000\n\n- interest_rate: 0.05  (since 5% = 0.05)\n\n- period: 10\n\n- compounding_frequency: not specified, so omit it, and it will default to 'Annually'\n\nNow, I need to output only the <TOOLCALL> section with the function call.\n\nSo, it should be: <TOOLCALL>[calculate_compounded_interest(principal=5000, interest_rate=0.05, period=10)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAfter this call, if I need more, I can, but this should fulfill the request.\n\nThe system says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nSo, this is the only function I need to call."}

Looking closely, it's an exact match, not a range. The function might expect an exact fee, but the user wants less than 400.\n\nThere's a mismatch here. The function requires an exact \"fee\" value, but the user wants lawyers with fees less than 400. I have to use the function as it is defined.

The system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\" But immediately after, it specifies the format for responses.\n\nPerhaps in cases where I can't call a function, I should output something like <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> and then explain, but the prompt says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" That contradicts.\n\nLooking back: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...

The function requires an exact fee, but the user wants less than 400. I don't have a way to specify \"less than\".\n\nPerhaps I can call it with fee=400, assuming it might return lawyers at that fee or less, but that's not what it says. The description doesn't specify if it's exact or not.\n\nThe param description: \"Hourly fee charged by lawyer\" \u2013 it sounds like an exact value.\n\nThis is a problem.

Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nI could call it with fee=399 or something, but that's arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps the function can handle it as is, and I should proceed.\n\nAnother thought: the function might be designed to find lawyers with that exact fee, so for less than 400, I can't directly use it.\n\nBut that would mean I can't fulfill the request, so I should return an empty list.\n\nThe prompt: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nIn this case, the question has the parameters, but the function doesn't support the exact query.\n\nThe parameters are there: city, specialty, fee. I can provide city=\"Chicago, IL\", specialty=[\"divorce\"], and fee= some value, but what value? If I put fee=400, it might not get less than.\n\nThis is tricky. Perhaps I should call it with fee=400 and assume it's the best I can do.\n\nI need to make a decision. As an experienced developer, I'd say the function as defined requires an exact fee, so I can't accurately fulfill \"less than 400\".\n\nTherefore, none of the functions can be used as is for this query.\n\nSo, I should return an empty list.\n\nThe response format: \"return an empty list then explain\", but the main instruction says not to include other text.\n\nPerhaps in the <TOOLCALL>, I put an empty list.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), ...]</TOOLCALL>\n\nIf none, maybe <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>\n\nAnd then, the system will handle the explanation.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... If not, imply to return an empty list.\"\n\nI think the safest is to output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, I'll go with that.\n\nPerhaps I can call the function with fee=399, as an approximation for less than 400.\n\nBut that might not be accurate.\n\nThe function might accept the fee as a maximum, but it's not specified.\n\nGiven that, I think it's better not to call it.\n\nFinal decision: Since the function requires an exact fee and the user wants less than, I can't use it properly, so return empty list."}

I need to interpret this. Probably, they mean cases from 2016 to 2021, since \"past 5 years from 2015\" could imply starting from 2015 and going back 5 years, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: \"past 5 years from 2015\" might mean from 2010 to 2015, but they specify \"from 2015 to 2021\". The sentence is: \"in the past 5 years from 2015 to 2021\". This is confusing. Let me read it again: \"Find state law cases related to land disputes in the past 5 years from 2015 to 2021 in New York.\"\n\nIt says: \"in the past 5 years from 2015 to 2021\".

This could be interpreted as the period from 2015 to 2021, and they might have miscounted the years. To proceed, I should use the range they provided: from 2015 to 2021.\n\nThe function requires a year_range as an array, like [start_year, end_year].\n\n- Location: New York\n\n- Judicial system: They specify \"state law cases\", so that would be 'state'.\n\nAvailable function: law_case_search\n\nIt requires:\n\n- topic: string, required \u2013 \"land disputes\"\n\n- year_range: array, required \u2013 e.g., [2015, 2021]\n\n- location: string, required \u2013 \"New York\"\n\n- judicial_system: string, optional \u2013 \"state\"\n\nThis matches perfectly.

Yes, the param description says type=\"array\", so I should pass it as an array, like [2015, 2021].\n\nAfter making this call, if I need more information, I could continue, but this seems to fulfill the request.\n\nThe user said \"in the past 5 years from 2015 to 2021\".

I should use \"London, UK\" to be precise.\n\nAmenities should be an array, like ['Tennis Court'].\n\nThe user didn't specify \"nearest\", but the function is called \"find_nearby\", which implies it's based on location.

But the response format is strict: only put function calls in <TOOLCALL>, or if not, perhaps just return nothing? The prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nThat contradicts the earlier instruction. Let's read carefully: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nBut then it says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nThis is confusing. In the initial system prompt: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nFollowed by: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nI think what it means is that in the response, if I'm not making a tool call, I should return an empty list and explain, but the overall instruction is to only have the tool call in that section.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" So, perhaps for no tool call, I need to output something like <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> and then explain, but it doesn't specify.\n\nLooking back: \"return an empty list then explain.\" But in the context, it might mean in the tool call section.\n\nTo be safe, I should check if I can make the call. The function requires route_preference, which is missing.\n\nPossible values for route_preference aren't specified, so I can't assume one. I need all required parameters.\n\nSince it's required and not provided, I shouldn't make the call.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nIn my response, I need to follow the format. Perhaps output: <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> and then explain outside, but the prompt says not to include other text.\n\nThe exact words: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nAnd earlier: \"If none of the functions can be used..., return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nI think the intention is to have the response be just the <TOOLCALL> part, and if no call, an empty one.\n\nBut to match, I'll assume that for no call, I output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>, but the prompt says \"return an empty list then explain\", which might mean in the response message.\n\nPerhaps in this setup, the AI is expected to only output the TOOLCALL section, and the system handles the rest.\n\nTo play it safe, since the user didn't provide route_preference, I can't make the call, so I should output an empty TOOLCALL.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete...\"\n\nSo, for this turn, I should output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> if I can't call anything.\n\nThe prompt also says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nImplying that if not, don't put anything, but it specifies to return an empty list.\n\nPerhaps the full response should be: <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> and then the explanation, but the prompt says \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. Looking at the very beginning: \"You need to make function/tool calls to solve the question given. If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nThen, \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nI think the \"then explain\" might be for the AI's internal reasoning, but in the actual output, only the TOOLCALL section is returned.\n\nIn my response as the AI, I should only output the <TOOLCALL> part.\n\nSo, for this case, since parameters are lacking, I should output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nIf I were to make the call, I need to provide a value for route_preference. Since it's not specified, I can't guess. For example, is \"shortest\" a valid value? The function is for shortest distance, so maybe \"shortest\", but it's not stated.\n\nThe function is called \"calculate_shortest_distance\", so perhaps it implies the preference is for shortest, but the parameter is still required.\n\nI think it's safer not to assume.\n\nSo, my decision: The question lacks the route_preference parameter, so I cannot make the call. Output an empty TOOLCALL."}

However, the function requires a specific brain_region. It doesn't have an option for \"all\" regions.\n\nThe function description: \"Retrieve the coordinates of the specified neuron in the rat's brain.\" It specifies a brain_region, so it's designed for one region at a time.\n\nThe user is asking for all parts, which means I might need to call this function multiple times, once for each region.

No: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" That might be conflicting.\n\nRe-reading: \"If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\" But then it says \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous.

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nFor the case where I don't invoke, it doesn't specify, but earlier it says \"return an empty list then explain.\" Perhaps I need to output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> or something.\n\nThe exact words: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nBut in the main instruction, it says to only return the function calls in <TOOLCALL>.\n\nTo reconcile, perhaps when not calling, I should just not output anything, but that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps in the context, \"return an empty list\" means in the <TOOLCALL> section, and \"then explain\" is for my internal thought, not the output.\n\nI need to strictly follow: only output the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nSo, I'll go with <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>"}

Otherwise, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nThe prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\" And earlier: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nI need to format it as <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> for no calls, and then explain separately, but the prompt insists on not including other text.\n\nThe very first part: \"You need to make function/tool calls to solve the question given. If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nThen: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. ...

Perhaps for this exercise, when I can't call, I should just output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>.\n\nIn the prompt, it says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[...]</TOOLCALL>. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nSo, for no calls, I might need to output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>, and the explanation is handled elsewhere.\n\nTo be safe, I'll follow the format strictly. Since I can't call the function, I'll return <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>.\n\nThe prompt says: \"return an empty list then explain\", but in the context of the response format, perhaps the explanation is not part of this response.\n\nPerhaps I should just output the <TOOLCALL> with an empty list.\n\nLet me think: The user message is the first turn, and I need to respond with tool calls if possible.\n\nSince I can't, I'll output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>.\n\nI need to explain, but the prompt says not to include other text.\n\nPerhaps in this setup, the AI is only supposed to output the <TOOLCALL> part, and the system handles the rest.\n\nTo match the instruction, I'll go with <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>.\n\nSo, my response should be: <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems incomplete. Let's double-check the prompt: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nFor no invocation, it implies just don't output anything else, but it says \"return an empty list then explain\", which might be for the overall system.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I should output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> as the empty list.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\nSo, final decision: Since the query lacks the platform parameter, I can't call the function, so I'll return an empty TOOLCALL."}

{"id": "simple_399", "result": "<TOOLCALL>[restaurant_search(location=\"New York City, NY\", cuisine=\"Italian\", rating=5, accepts_credit_cards=true)]</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 416, "output_token_count": 32, "latency": 8.346688985824585, "reasoning_content": "First, the user is asking to find the best Italian restaurants in New York City with an average customer rating of more than 4 and that accept credit cards.\n\nI have a function called \"restaurant_search\" that can handle this. Let me check its parameters:\n\n- location: Required, string, e.g., New York City, NY\n\n- cuisine: Required, string, e.g., Italian\n\n- rating: Required, integer, minimum average customer rating out of 5\n\n- accepts_credit_cards: Required, boolean, if the restaurant should accept credit cards\n\nThe user's request matches perfectly:\n\n- Location: New York City, NY (I need to format it as per the example)\n\n- Cuisine: Italian\n\n- Rating: More than 4, so the minimum should be 5, but wait, rating is an integer out of 5, and it says \"more than 4\", which could mean 4.1 or higher, but since it's an integer parameter, I have to use the closest integer. The parameter is \"minimum average customer rating out of 5\", and it's an integer, so if they say more than 4, that probably means at least 5, but that doesn't make sense because ratings go up to 5.\n\nThe parameter description: \"Minimum average customer rating out of 5\" and it's an integer. If the user says \"more than 4\", that typically means greater than 4, so 4.1 to 5. But since the parameter is an integer, I need to interpret what integer to use. If I set rating=5, it would mean exactly 5 or at least 5, but the description says \"minimum\", so rating=5 means at least 5.\n\nThe user said \"more than 4\", which includes 4.1 up to 5. However, since the parameter is an integer and represents the minimum, if I set it to 5, it will only return restaurants with at least 5, which is perfect or above. But that might exclude restaurants with 4.5, for example.\n\nThis is a problem. The parameter is defined as an integer, so I have to choose an integer value. Probably, the function expects 1 through 5, and setting it to 5 means minimum 5.\n\nIn the user's request: \"average customer ratings of more than 4\". To be precise, more than 4 means greater than 4, so if the function takes an integer as minimum, I should set it to 5, assuming that 5 means 5.0 and above.\n\nBut that might not be accurate. Perhaps the function interprets the integer as the floor or something, but I don't know. Based on the description, I'll have to go with what's available.\n\nI need to make a decision. The parameter is required and it's an integer, so I'll use 5 for \"more than 4\", assuming it means at least 5.\n\nAdditionally, accepts_credit_cards: The user said \"accepts credit cards\", so that's true.\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- location: \"New York City, NY\"\n\n- cuisine: \"Italian\"\n\n- rating: 5 (since more than 4, and it's an integer)\n\n- accepts_credit_cards: true\n\nIs rating=5 correct? Let me double-check. If a restaurant has 4.5, and I set minimum to 5, it might not return it. But the user said \"more than 4\", which includes 4.5. However, since the tool only allows integers, I have to choose. Perhaps I should use 4, but that would include exactly 4, which is not more than 4.\n\nThe parameter is \"minimum average customer rating\", and it's an integer, so if I set it to 4, it means at least 4, which includes 4.0 to 5.0, but the user wants more than 4, so greater than 4.0.\n\nThis is ambiguous. In the absence of better options, I'll assume that setting it to 5 is the best I can do, or perhaps I should clarify, but I can't; I have to make the call.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\" But in this case, it has all parameters.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with rating=5.\n\nMaybe the integer represents the minimum whole number, but I think I have to go with it.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rating parameter is meant to be the minimum integer rating, so for more than 4, if ratings are like 1-5 stars, more than 4 means 5 stars.\n\nI'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, the function call should be: restaurant_search(location=\"New York City, NY\", cuisine=\"Italian\", rating=5, accepts_credit_cards=true)\n\nNow, for the response format: I need to put it in <TOOLCALL> tags, like <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSpecifically: <TOOLCALL>[restaurant_search(location=\"New York City, NY\", cuisine=\"Italian\", rating=5, accepts_credit_cards=true)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nAnd that's the only thing in the response.\n\nOnce I make this call, if that's all, the system will handle the rest.\n\nI think that's it for this turn."}
