We must represent this as a dict in the function call. However, in the XML-like format we are using, we have to represent the dictionary as a string? But note the instruction: the type must be one of the allowed types, and dict is allowed. But the function call format we are using (with XML) does not directly support nested structures. \n\nWe have to represent the dictionary as a string in JSON format? But note the type specified in the function call must be 'dict'. However, the way we are to represent it in the XML is by having a value that is a string representation of the dictionary? Actually, the system expects the type to be specified as 'dict', and then the value should be a string that can be parsed as a dictionary? Or perhaps the system will handle it if we specify the type as 'dict' and then the value as a string that is a JSON representation.\n\nLooking at the function definition for `ChaDri.change_drink`, the `new_preferences` is of type `dict`. In the XML format we are using, we can represent a dictionary by providing a string that is a JSON representation. But note: the instructions say the type must be one of the allowed types, and we are to use the type as 'dict'. Then the value should be a string that is a JSON object.\n\nAlternatively, the system might be able to handle a nested structure? But our function call format is flat (only one level of parameters). Therefore, we must represent the dictionary as a JSON string and set the type to 'dict'. However, in the function call, we are only allowed to have simple types? Actually, the function definition includes a dict, so we can pass a dict by representing it as a string and then the system will parse it.\n\nBut note: the function call format we are using does not have a way to represent nested parameters. Therefore, we must represent the entire dictionary as a string and set the type to 'dict'. Then the function on the backend will parse the string as a dictionary.\n\nSo for the drink change:\n  - `drink_id`: \"123\" (string)\n  - `new_preferences`: a string that is a JSON representation of the dictionary, and type='dict'\n\nExample of the dictionary as a string:\n  '{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}'\n\nBut note: the function definition does not specify the exact keys, so we are using the keys that are common in such contexts. We are including the attributes that the customer mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to rely on the function's documentation. Since the function says `new_preferences` is a dict of updated preferences, we pass the keys that the customer specified.\n\nLet's break down the customer's drink request:\n  - \"large\" -> size\n  - \"hot\" -> temperature\n  - \"regular sweetness\" -> sweetness: regular\n  - \"almond milk\" -> milk: almond milk\n\nSo we'll create a dictionary with:\n  size: \"large\"\n  temperature: \"hot\"\n  sweetness: \"regular\"\n  milk: \"almond milk\"\n\nWe'll represent this dictionary as a JSON string.\n\nNow, we have two function calls to make.\n\nWe'll output both in the same <TOOLCALL> block.\n\nNote: The function names are exactly as given: \"ChaFod\" and \"ChaDri.change_drink\".\n\nLet's write the function calls:\n\nFirst function call: ChaFod\n  - foodItem: \"Caesar salad\", type: string\n  - removeIngredients: \"anchovies\", type: string\n  - newIngredients: (default) we can skip because the default is empty and the customer didn't add any new ingredients? But note: the customer only said \"without anchovies\", so no new ingredients. We can set it to empty string or omit? The function has default for newIngredients and removeIngredients and specialInstructions. However, in the XML we are required to set the parameters that are needed. We can set newIngredients to empty string? But the function has a default, so we can omit if we are not providing a value? Actually, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But note: the function has defaults for the other parameters. So we can provide only the ones that are non-default.\n\nBut the problem: our function call format does not allow omitting parameters? Actually, the function definition in the XML we are to create must have the parameters that we are setting. The parameters that we are not setting should be omitted? Or set to default? The instruction does not specify. However, the function definition in the docstring has defaults, so we can omit the parameters that we are not changing.\n\nBut the format we are using: we have to include all parameters we are setting. We don't have to include parameters that we are leaving as default? Actually, the function call in the XML is structured with <param> tags only for the parameters we are passing. So we can pass only the parameters we are setting.\n\nFor `ChaFod`:\n  We must set `foodItem` and `removeIngredients`. We don't set `newIngredients` and `specialInstructions` because they are not specified and the function has defaults.\n\nBut note: the function has `newIngredients` and `removeIngredients` as default empty string. So we can pass only:\n  - `foodItem`: \"Caesar salad\"\n  - `removeIngredients`: \"anchovies\"\n\nHowever, the function also has `specialInstructions` which we are not setting. So we omit it.\n\nSecond function call: ChaDri.change_drink\n  - drink_id: \"123\"\n  - new_preferences: a dictionary represented as a string in JSON format, and type='dict'\n\nSo we write the dictionary as a string: \n  '{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}'\n\nBut note: we must escape any quotes inside? The XML will be handled by a parser, so we should use a string without breaking the XML. We can use double quotes for the JSON and the XML attribute value will be enclosed in double quotes. So we must escape the double quotes inside? Or use single quotes for the JSON? \n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes for the JSON string inside the attribute. But the JSON standard requires double quotes. So we must escape the double quotes? Actually, in XML, we can use either single or double quotes for attribute values. But our outer attribute value is already in double quotes. So we can represent the JSON string with single quotes? But then it's not valid JSON.\n\nAlternatively, we can use double quotes for the entire attribute and then escape the inner double quotes by replacing \" with &quot;? But that might be messy.\n\nBut note: the function call is being generated and then will be parsed by the system. The system might be able to handle a string without escaping? Alternatively, we can use a CDATA section? But our format doesn't allow that.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent the dictionary without quotes? But that is not JSON.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes for the attribute value and then double quotes inside? That is acceptable because XML allows single quotes for attributes.\n\nSo let's do:\n  value='{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}'\n\nBut note: the entire value is in single quotes, and the inner double quotes are fine.\n\nBut wait: the value of the attribute must be a string. So we are representing the dictionary as a string and then the function will parse it.\n\nWe'll set the type of new_preferences to 'dict'.\n\nNow, we write the XML:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"ChaFod\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"foodItem\" value=\"Caesar salad\" type=\"string\"/>\n    <param name=\"removeIngredients\" value=\"anchovies\" type=\"string\"/>\n  </params>\n</function>\n<function name=\"ChaDri.change_drink\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"drink_id\" value=\"123\" type=\"string\"/>\n    <param name=\"new_preferences\" value='{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n  </params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nBut note: the function name for the drink change is \"ChaDri.change_drink\". We have to use that exact string.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to consider if the system expects the function name without the module? But the function definition is given as `ChaDri.change_drink`, so we use that.\n\nLet's output accordingly."}

We'll break it down step by step and use the provided functions accordingly.\n\n Step 1: Clone the repo\n   We'll use clone_repo with the given repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n Step 2: Analyse the contents and create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - First, we need to analyse the repo to determine the predominant language. However, the task says to create/update dockerfile and kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\n   - We note that the function `analyse_repo_contents` returns the predominant programming language. But the task does not require us to use that information explicitly? \n   - However, the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not take the language as an argument. So we can skip the analysis if the creation functions are generic? \n   - But the task says \"based on the analysis\". Since the functions we have for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs are generic and don't use the language, we might not need the analysis function. \n   - Alternatively, the analysis might be needed for the Dockerfile creation? However, the `create_a_docker_file` function does not take the language as an argument. So it must be creating a generic Dockerfile? \n   - Since the problem does not specify, we will assume that `create_a_docker_file` is smart enough to look at the directory and create an appropriate Dockerfile. So we don't need to call `analyse_repo_contents` explicitly? \n   - But note: the function `create_a_docker_file` only takes `directory_name`. So it must be doing the analysis internally? \n\n   Therefore, we can proceed without calling `analyse_repo_contents` separately.\n\n   Steps 2.1: Create/update Dockerfile: call `create_a_docker_file` with the directory name. \n     However, note: the clone step did not specify a destination? So by default, the repo is cloned into the current directory. The repo name is derived from the URL. The repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so the directory created will be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n   Steps 2.2: Create Kubernetes YAMLs: call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with the directory name. \n     We are not provided with all the parameters for the Kubernetes YAML, so we will use the defaults for the ones that are optional.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes. \n   This step is automatically done by the `push_git_changes_to_github` function? Because the description says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So we don't need a separate step.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push to the repo. \n   We'll use `push_git_changes_to_github` with the directory name and appropriate commit message, branch, etc.\n\n However, note that the task says: \"Do all the following using the steps provided in their respective sections.\" and we are to output the function calls.\n\n Let's plan the function calls:\n\n  1. clone_repo: \n        repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n        destination: not specified, so use default (current directory) -> we can omit.\n        recursive: default false -> omit.\n        depth: not specified -> omit.\n\n  2.1. create_a_docker_file:\n        directory_name: since the repo is cloned into 'nodejs-welcome' (the last part of the URL without .git) we can use that.\n\n  2.2. create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n        directory_name: same as above, 'nodejs-welcome'\n        deployment_name: not provided -> use default? The function says \"use Defaults if not provided\", but we don't know what that default is. Since it's optional, we can omit and the function will use a default.\n        image_name: default is 'latest', but we don't have an image built? The task doesn't build an image. So we might leave it as default? \n        However, note: the Kubernetes deployment needs an image. We haven't built one. This might be a gap? But the task doesn't require building the image. We are only generating the YAML.\n        We'll use the defaults for replicas, port, and service_type.\n\n  4. push_git_changes_to_github:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        commit_message: we can use the default 'Update changes'\n        branch_name: default 'main'\n        force_push: default false -> omit.\n\n But note: the task says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then commit/push (step 4). The push function does both? The description says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So step 3 is covered.\n\n However, the task says \"Do all the following using the steps provided\". We have to do step 2.1 and 2.2 in the same directory.\n\n But note: the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` require the directory_name. We are using the same directory for both.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n We have to call:\n  1. clone_repo\n  2. create_a_docker_file\n  3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n  4. push_git_changes_to_github\n\n We must note that the directory name for the cloned repo is 'nodejs-welcome'. \n\n However, what if the destination was changed? We didn't change it. So we are safe.\n\n Let's write the function calls in XML format:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"clone_repo\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"repo_url\" value=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nBut note: the push function has a default commit message and branch. We are using the defaults so we don't need to specify.\n\n However, the task says \"commit / push to repo\". The push function does both.\n\n But wait: what if the branch is not 'main'? The task doesn't specify. We are using the default.\n\n Also, note that the Kubernetes function has many optional parameters. We are omitting them and using the defaults.\n\n However, the task does not specify the parameters for the Kubernetes YAML, so we are safe.\n\n We assume that the functions are implemented to handle the defaults appropriately.\n\n Therefore, the above function calls should suffice."}

Find relevant classes that might be related to 'CellResult' in the repository including subdirectories.\n    - We'll use the function `get_relevant_classes` with `search_string` as 'CellResult', and set `include_subdirectories` to True to search everywhere.\n 2. Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n    - We need to get the method signatures for these two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can use the function `get_signature` for each method.\n\n However, note that the `get_signature` function requires the class name and method name. We are only given the class name 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method names.\n\n Steps:\n 1. For the first task: \n    - Call `get_relevant_classes` with:\n        search_string: \"CellResult\"\n        case_sensitive: false (since we don't know if it's case sensitive, but typically in Java it's case sensitive but we want to be safe, but the function defaults to case-insensitive which is safe)\n        include_subdirectories: true (because we want to include subdirectories)\n\n 2. For the second task:\n    - We need to call `get_signature` for the method 'setCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n    - Then call `get_signature` for the method 'getCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n\n But note: the `get_signature` function has an `include_private` parameter. We don't know if these methods are private, but since they are being overridden, they are likely public. So we can set `include_private` to false.\n\n However, the user might be in a Java context, but the function `get_signature` is designed to work for the current module. Since the user is working on a Java project, we must note that the functions provided might be language-agnostic? But the description of `get_signature` doesn't specify language. We'll assume it can handle Java.\n\n But wait: the function `get_class_info` and `get_signature` require the module name? They are optional only if the class is in the current module. We don't have the module name for 'AbstractCellHandler'. However, the problem does not specify the module. We have to rely on the fact that the class is available in the current context. Since we don't have the module, we might have to call without it? But the function `get_signature` doesn't have a module parameter. Actually, looking at the function definitions:\n\n - `get_class_info` has an optional `module_name` argument.\n - `get_signature` does not have a module_name argument. So it must be that the class is in the current module? Or the function `get_signature` is designed to search the entire project? The function description doesn't specify. We have to assume that the class is known in the current context.\n\n Since the user is asking about a specific class in their project, we hope that the tool has the context.\n\n Alternatively, we might need to get the class info for 'AbstractCellHandler' to see if it exists? But the user is already extending it, so it should be present.\n\n Let's proceed with the calls.\n\n We are going to make three function calls:\n  1. get_relevant_classes for \"CellResult\" with include_subdirectories=True\n  2. get_signature for class \"AbstractCellHandler\", method \"setCellValue\", include_private=False\n  3. get_signature for class \"AbstractCellHandler\", method \"getCellValue\", include_private=False\n\n However, note: the function `get_signature` might not return multiple methods? It returns the signature for a specified method. So we have to call it for each method.\n\n But what if the method is overloaded? The function `get_signature` description says it retrieves the signature of a specified method. It doesn't say how it handles overloading. We'll assume that the tool will return one of the overloads or an error? But the user is overriding one specific method. We'll have to hope that the tool returns the correct one.\n\n Alternatively, we might use `get_class_info` for the class 'AbstractCellHandler' to get all methods and then filter for the ones we want? But the user only wants the signatures of two methods. And we don't want to include private ones? So we can set include_private to false.\n\n However, the problem asks for the signatures of two methods. We can either:\n   Option 1: Use two `get_signature` calls (one for each method)\n   Option 2: Use one `get_class_info` call to get all the methods and then we can extract the two methods? But then we are returning a lot of information.\n\n But note: the function `get_class_info` returns information about the class including methods and properties. We can then filter for the two methods. However, the problem specifically asks for the signatures. The `get_class_info` might return the list of methods without the full signature? Or with? We don't know the exact return structure. Since we have a function `get_signature` that returns the signature, it might be more direct.\n\n Considering the instructions, we are to use the functions as provided. Since there is a function specifically for getting the signature of a method, we'll use that.\n\n Therefore, we will do:\n\n 1. get_relevant_classes with parameters:\n        search_string: \"CellResult\"\n        include_subdirectories: true\n\n 2. get_signature for (class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name: \"setCellValue\", include_private: false)\n 3. get_signature for (class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name: \"getCellValue\", include_private: false)\n\n But note: the function `get_relevant_classes` returns a list of class names. We are only interested in classes related to 'CellResult'. We are not going to do anything else with that list? We just return it to the user.\n\n However, the user also has an error about 'getNumericValue' not found in 'CellResult'. The search for classes related to 'CellResult' might help the user find the correct class that has the method.\n\n Now, we write the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n Important: The parameters must have the correct type. We have:\n   For get_relevant_classes:\n        search_string: string\n        case_sensitive: boolean (we'll use false, which is the default, but we can set it explicitly? The function defaults to false. Since we want to be safe, we can set it to false. But note: the user didn't specify case sensitivity, so we use the default. However, the function call requires all parameters? Actually, the function has defaults for case_sensitive and include_subdirectories. But in the tool call, we are allowed to omit parameters that have defaults? Actually, the instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But we are providing the required parameters. The required parameter is only `search_string`. The others are optional. But in the XML, we are to include all the parameters we are setting.\n\n However, the tool call format does not require including parameters that are set to their default? But the instructions say to put the function call in the specified format. We can include all parameters we want to set, including the ones that are default. But to be safe, we'll set the ones that are not the default.\n\n For get_relevant_classes:\n   We are setting:\n        search_string: \"CellResult\"\n        include_subdirectories: true   [default is false, so we must set it]\n        case_sensitive: false          [default is false, so we can omit? But to be explicit, we can set it]\n\n But note: the function signature says `case_sensitive` defaults to false. So if we don't set it, it will be false. We can omit it? However, the tool call format requires that we put the parameters we are using. Since we are using the default for `case_sensitive`, we can omit it? But the instructions don't specify. To be safe, we'll include it because we are setting it to false.\n\n Alternatively, the tool might require only the parameters that are different from default? But the function description doesn't specify. We'll include all parameters we are setting, even if they are the default.\n\n But wait: the example in the instructions includes all parameters? Actually, the example includes a function call with multiple parameters. We are allowed to include any parameter.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   For get_relevant_classes:\n        <param name=\"search_string\" value=\"CellResult\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"case_sensitive\" value=\"false\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n        <param name=\"include_subdirectories\" value=\"true\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n\n   For each get_signature:\n        <param name=\"class_name\" value=\"AbstractCellHandler\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"method_name\" value=\"setCellValue\" type=\"string\"/>   [for the first one]\n        <param name=\"include_private\" value=\"false\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n\n   And similarly for the second get_signature with method_name=\"getCellValue\"\n\n Now, we write the tool call."}

What is the weather in Queenstown Singapore?\n\n We have two functions that can help:\n - get_area_of_square: for the first question.\n - get_current_weather: for the second question.\n\n For the first function, we note:\n   - It requires one argument: size (float). The user provided \"5 cm\". However, the function does not require a unit because it just calculates the area. But note: the function expects a float. We can extract the number 5.0.\n\n However, the function does not care about the unit, but the user specified \"cm\". The function returns the area in square units of the input. So if the input is 5 cm, the area would be 25 cm\u00b2. We can pass the value 5.0 as the size.\n\n Important: the function get_area_of_square only takes one parameter: size (float). We can call it with value 5.0.\n\n For the second function:\n   - It requires: location (str). The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\". We can pass that as the location string.\n   - It also has an optional parameter unit (default is 'fahrenheit'). The user didn't specify, so we can use the default.\n\n However, note that the function expects a location in the format like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\". This is acceptable as a string.\n\n We can make two separate function calls in one <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n Steps:\n 1. For the area: call get_area_of_square with size=5.0 (converted from \"5 cm\" to float 5.0).\n 2. For the weather: call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown Singapore\".\n\n But note: the user specified the unit for the square as cm, but the function doesn't take unit. We are just passing the number. The function will return the area in square cm? Actually, the function doesn't know the unit. It just returns the square of the number. We are responsible for interpreting the unit. However, the question asks for the area, and we are given 5 cm, so we can compute 5*5 = 25 cm\u00b2. The function returns 25.0 and we can then label it as cm\u00b2.\n\n Since the function doesn't take unit, we just pass the numeric value.\n\n For the weather, we don't specify unit so it defaults to 'fahrenheit'. But the user might expect Celsius? However, the user did not specify. We can use the default. Alternatively, we could note that Singapore uses Celsius, but the function defaults to Fahrenheit. However, the problem does not specify. Since the user did not specify, we use the default.\n\n Alternatively, we could consider that the user is in a country that uses Celsius and change the unit to Celsius? But the instructions say: if the question lacks parameters, point it out. However, the unit is optional and we have a default. So we can proceed with the default.\n\n But note: the function description says the unit parameter is a string and default is 'fahrenheit'. We can also pass 'celsius'. Since the user did not specify, we can either:\n   a) Use the default (fahrenheit)\n   b) Assume the user in Singapore would prefer Celsius.\n\n However, the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. But the unit is optional. So we don't have to point it out. We can choose to use the default or we can choose to use a more appropriate unit.\n\n Since the user did not specify, we will use the default. But note: the function allows the unit to be specified. We are allowed to change it if we think it's more appropriate? However, the instruction says to use the parameters as given.\n\n Since the user did not specify the unit for weather, we can leave it as default. However, let me reexamine the function: the unit is an optional argument. So we can omit it and it will use 'fahrenheit'. But in the context of Singapore, it is common to use Celsius. We don't have information about the user's preference.\n\n How about we do this: we call the function with the default unit. The system might be designed to return both if needed? But the function doesn't. Alternatively, we can call it twice? But that's inefficient.\n\n Since the user did not specify, we use the default. If the user wants Celsius, they can ask again.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the unit 'celsius' for the weather in Singapore? But the user didn't specify. We are not instructed to assume. We are to use the parameters as provided or use the defaults if not provided.\n\n Decision: for the weather function, we will call with location=\"Queenstown Singapore\" and without the unit parameter (so it uses default). But note: the function has a default of 'fahrenheit'. However, we can also set unit to 'celsius' if we think that's more appropriate? But the instruction does not say we can change the behavior based on location. We must stick to the user's input.\n\n The user input: \"what is the weather in Queenstown Singapore\" does not specify unit. Therefore, we use the default.\n\n But note: the function has an optional parameter. We are allowed to omit it.\n\n Alternatively, we can ask for clarification? However, the instruction says: if the question lacks parameters, point it out. But the unit is optional. So we don't have to. We can proceed.\n\n However, let me read the instruction again: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" The function requires only the location.

But note: the function does not have a way to search for multiple types at once.\n\n We have two options:\n   Option 1: Make two separate calls (one for 'concert' and one for 'theater') and then combine the results.\n   Option 2: Since the user says \"any\", we might choose a broader category if available? But the function doesn't have a category for both.\n\n Given the constraints, we can do two function calls: one for concerts and one for theater.\n\n However, note: the function Events_3_FindEvents has a parameter event_type which is a string. We cannot pass an array.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to use a more general term? But the documentation does not specify.\n\n Let's assume the function supports:\n   - For music concerts: event_type could be 'concert'\n   - For theater plays: event_type could be 'theater'\n\n We are not sure, but we have to try.\n\n Also, note: the city should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)'. For Los Angeles, we can use 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n The date is '2023-03-10'.\n\n We'll make two function calls.\n\n But note: the system expects the function calls to be in a specific XML format.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\n And we are allowed to make multiple function calls in one <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n So we can do:\n\n <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"event_type\" value=\"concert\" type=\"string\"/>\n          <param name=\"city\" value=\"Los Angeles, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n          <param name=\"date\" value=\"2023-03-10\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n      </function>\n      <function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"event_type\" value=\"theater\" type=\"string\"/>\n          <param name=\"city\" value=\"Los Angeles, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n          <param name=\"date\" value=\"2023-03-10\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function Events_3_FindEvents has a default for date of 'any'. We are specifying the date.\n\n However, the user specifically asked for March 10th, so we set the date.\n\n But what if the function doesn't support 'concert' and 'theater'? We have to hope that it does.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a single call with a broader type? But the function does not have a 'both' or 'music or theater' option.\n\n So we do two calls.\n\n Also note: the user says \"this year is 2023\", so the date is 2023-03-10.\n\n Let's output the two calls."}

Search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA (without specifying unisex, so we use default)\n 2. Book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\n However, note that the booking requires the stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date.\n We are directly given the salon name ('Elegant Styles'), time ('15:00'), and date ('2023-05-10').\n\n But note: the user also asked to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA. We don't have any filter for unisex, so we can use the default.\n\n We can break it down:\n Step 1: Use Services_1_FindProvider to search for hair stylists in Sunnyvale, CA. We don't have a unisex preference, so we can set is_unisex to 'dontcare' or leave it out (since the default is 'dontcare').\n Step 2: Then, we want to book an appointment. However, note that the booking function requires a stylist_name (which we can get from the search?) but the user already specified the salon name as 'Elegant Styles'. \n\n But note: the user's request is to book with 'Elegant Styles' salon. So we don't need the result of the search to book? However, the search might be for general purpose? But the booking is specific.\n\n Let's interpret:\n The user wants two separate things:\n   a. Search for hair stylists in Sunnyvale, CA (without any specific salon, just a general search)\n   b. Book an appointment at a specific salon.\n\n However, the problem is: the booking function does not require the city, only the stylist/salon name, time and date.\n\n But note: the salon name might not be unique? However, the function does not require city for booking. So we assume the salon name is enough? \n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to use the result of the search to book? But they explicitly said \"book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon\". So we can book without the search.\n\n But the user also asked to search. So we must do both.\n\n How about:\n We do the search for Sunnyvale, CA (without unisex filter) and then separately book the appointment.\n\n However, note that the booking function does not require the city. So we can book the appointment independently.\n\n Therefore, we can make two function calls:\n\n First function: Services_1_FindProvider for Sunnyvale, CA.\n Second function: Services_1_BookAppointment for salon 'Elegant Styles' at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\n But note: the user might be expecting the search to be for the purpose of booking? But they explicitly named the salon for booking, so we can do the booking without the search result.\n\n Alternatively, the user might want to verify that 'Elegant Styles' is in Sunnyvale? But the search function does not take a salon name, it returns a list. We cannot filter by salon name in the search function.\n\n Since the user asked for two separate actions, we do both.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Call Services_1_FindProvider with city='Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex is not specified -> we can omit is_unisex (since default is 'dontcare') or set it to 'dontcare'. But note the function definition: the default is 'dontcare'. So we can just pass city.\n\n 2. Call Services_1_BookAppointment with stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10'\n\n However, note: the function Services_1_FindProvider requires the city in the format 'City, State (abbr)'. The user provided 'Sunnyvale, CA' which is the correct format.\n\n But wait: the state abbreviation is two letters? Yes, CA is correct.\n\n So we can write:\n\n <TOOLCALL>\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"Services_1_FindProvider\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"city\" value=\"Sunnyvale, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n   <function name=\"Services_1_BookAppointment\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"stylist_name\" value=\"Elegant Styles\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"appointment_time\" value=\"15:00\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"appointment_date\" value=\"2023-05-10\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function Services_1_FindProvider has an optional parameter is_unisex. Since we don't have a preference, we can skip it and the default will be used.\n\n Alternatively, we can set is_unisex to 'dontcare'? However, the function definition says the default is 'dontcare'. And the type is boolean with default string? Actually, the function definition says:\n   is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\n\n But note: the function call expects the type to be one of the allowed types. The type of is_unisex is boolean? But the default is a string? This is confusing.\n\n Let me re-read the function definition:\n\n    is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare'): Flag indicating if the salon is unisex. True for unisex, False for gender-specific, or dontcare for no preference.\n\n However, the function expects a boolean? But then how do we represent 'dontcare'? \n\n The function description says: \n   True for unisex, False for gender-specific, or dontcare for no preference.\n\n But note: the type in the function call must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n We cannot pass a string for a parameter that is defined as boolean? \n\n Actually, the function definition in the docstring might be using a string for the default, but the parameter type is boolean? That doesn't match.\n\n This is a problem in the function definition.\n\n Since the function expects a boolean but also allows a string default, we have to see what the function actually accepts.\n\n But the instruction says: the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n So we must choose one of these.\n\n Looking at the function: \n   The parameter is_unisex: \n        - It can be True, False, or 'dontcare'\n\n How can we represent that? \n\n The function might be designed to accept:\n   - boolean for True/False\n   - and a string for 'dontcare'\n\n But the type in the function call must be consistent? \n\n Alternatively, the function might be defined to accept a string that can be one of: 'true', 'false', 'dontcare'. Then we would set the type to string.\n\n However, the function definition says:\n        is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\n\n This is ambiguous.\n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, and we are instructed to use one of the types, and the function description says the default is 'dontcare' (a string), I think we should use string for the is_unisex parameter.\n\n But wait: the function definition says the type is boolean? But then the default is a string? That doesn't match.\n\n Alternatively, the function might be implemented to accept:\n   - When the value is a boolean, it's either True or False.\n   - When it's a string, it's 'dontcare'.\n\n However, the function call requires a single type.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will follow the function definition as per the docstring: the parameter is_unisex is defined as a boolean with a default string. This is inconsistent.\n\n To resolve, note that the function call format allows us to set the type. We have to choose the type that matches the value.\n\n Since the function allows three states (true, false, dontcare) and we are not specifying a preference (so we want dontcare), we can pass a string with value 'dontcare'. But the function expects a boolean? \n\n Alternatively, we can skip the parameter and let the function use the default? \n\n How does the function call mechanism handle omitted parameters? \n\n The instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\n\n But the function has a default for is_unisex, so it's optional. Therefore, we can omit it.\n\n Therefore, we can just pass the city and omit is_unisex.\n\n So the call for Services_1_FindProvider will only have the city.\n\n Now, for the booking: the parameters are clear.\n\n Therefore, the function calls are as above without the is_unisex.\n\n But note: the user did not specify any unisex requirement, so we are safe to omit.\n\n Final function calls:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"Services_1_FindProvider\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"city\" value=\"Sunnyvale, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"Services_1_BookAppointment\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"stylist_name\" value=\"Elegant Styles\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"appointment_time\" value=\"15:00\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"appointment_date\" value=\"2023-05-10\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}
