Let me check the available functions. There's a currency_conversion.convert function. The parameters needed are amount, from_currency, and to_currency. The amount here is 150, from_currency is Euros, and to_currency is Canadian dollars. I need to make sure the parameters are in the correct format. Since the function requires these three parameters, I can call the function with those values. No missing parameters, so I should proceed."}

Let me check the functions available. There's a convert_currency function. The parameters needed are base_currency, target_currency, and amount. The base_currency here is Japanese Yen, which is JPY. The target is US Dollar, so USD. The amount is 20,000. I need to make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires base_currency, target_currency, and amount. All three are provided. So I should call convert_currency with these values."}
