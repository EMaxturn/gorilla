The user has three parts to their question, so I need to handle each part one after another.\n\nFirst, they want the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The given information is 5 moles and 2800 kJ/mol. Looking at the functions provided, there's 'biological.calc_energy' which takes mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The default for joules_per_mol is 2800, but since they specified it, I should include that. So the parameters would be mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', and joules_per_mol=2800. That should calculate the total energy.\n\nNext, the biomass calculation. They mention a conversion efficiency of 10%. The function 'biological.calc_biomass' requires energy and efficiency. The energy here is the result from the first step. Since efficiency has a default of 0.1 (10%), but they specified 10%, I should input 0.1 as a float. So once I have the energy from the first function, I can call calc_biomass with that energy and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird part is calculating work done by the machine. The machine moves 2 meters, and work is energy multiplied by distance. The function 'physical.calc_work' needs energy and distance. The energy here is the same as the first step's result. So after getting the energy, I can use calc_work with energy from step one and distance=2.\n\nWait, but the user wants the work done by the machine, which would be the energy produced by the bacteria converted into work. But the problem states that the machine needs to move 2 meters. So the work done is the total energy multiplied by distance? Wait, no. Wait, work is force times distance. But the function 'calc_work' probably takes energy and distance, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take energy and distance, but that's not the standard formula. Wait, standard work is force * distance, and energy is work done. So if the machine uses the energy to do work, maybe the function is using the energy as the work done, but that's confusing. Wait, the function's description says \"Calculate the work from energy.\" So maybe the function is using the energy to compute work, perhaps assuming that the energy is converted into work over a certain distance. But the parameters are energy and distance. Wait, that doesn't align with the standard formula. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take the energy and distance, but that's not standard. Wait, perhaps the function is a placeholder, and the user expects to use the energy from the first step and multiply by distance. But according to the function's parameters, the user has to call the function. So I need to check the function parameters again.\n\nWait, the user provided functions. Let me check again.
