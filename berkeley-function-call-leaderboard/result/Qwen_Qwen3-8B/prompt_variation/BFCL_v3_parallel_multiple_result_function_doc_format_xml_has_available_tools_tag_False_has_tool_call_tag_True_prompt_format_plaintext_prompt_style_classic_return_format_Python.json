There's animal_population.get_history for historical data and animal_population.get_projection for future projections. \n\nFor the historical data part, the user mentioned Bangladesh and India. The function requires country, species, and years. The species here is \"tiger,\" and the years are 5. So I need to call get_history twice, once for each country.\n\nNext, for the projections in Nepal and Malaysia, the function get_projection is needed. The parameters are similar: country, species, and years. The species is still tiger, and the years are 10. So another two calls for these countries.\n\nWait, the user specified \"last 5 years\" and \"next 10 years.\" The years parameter in the functions is the number of years to retrieve or predict. So for the historical data, years=5 makes sense. For the projection, years=10 is correct. \n\nI should make sure that all required parameters are provided.

The user wants to use the data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model. They mentioned setting x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], and also want the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data. The data_loading function can do that. The parameters required are file_path and optionally delimiter. The user provided the file name as dataset.csv, so I'll use that. Assuming the delimiter is comma since it's a CSV, but maybe it's better to specify it explicitly. Wait, the user didn't mention the delimiter, so maybe it's safe to leave it out or assume default. But the function's delimiter is optional, so I can omit it. So call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to fit the linear regression. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y arrays, and return_residuals as a boolean. The user wants x to be data['sales'] and y data['future_sales']. So after loading the data, I'll call linear_regression_fit with those arrays. Also, return_residuals should be True to get the residuals.\n\nWait, but the parameters for the functions are in the format of the function's parameters. So for data_loading, the output would be the data structure, which I can then reference. But in the function calls, I need to pass the parameters. So first, load the data, then use that data in the regression.\n\nSo the first step is to call data_loading with the file path. Then, use the resulting data to call linear_regression_fit with x and y as specified, and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the function calls, how do I reference the data from the previous step? Well, the data_loading function would return the data, which would be stored in a variable. Then, the next function uses that variable. But since the user is asking for the functions to be called in sequence, I need to make sure that the data is loaded first.\n\nSo the correct sequence is: first, load the data using data_loading, then pass the x and y from that data into linear_regression_fit. Therefore, the two function calls are needed. The user didn't specify the delimiter, so I'll omit that parameter. Also, return_residuals is set to True as per the user's request."}

The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it retrieves the price based on material, size, and museum location. \n\nBut wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size (as an array). The user provided both museum locations, materials, and sizes for each sculpture.

The function requires museum_location (string), sculpture_material (string), and sculpture_size (array of numbers). \n\nSo for the first one: museum_location=\"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4]. Second: museum_location=\"New York\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3]. \n\nBut wait, the user asked for the average price of both. However, the function get_artwork_price might return the price for each individually. So I need to call the function twice and then calculate the average. But since the functions can't be chained here, I need to make two separate calls. \n\nWait, the user's question is about two different sculptures. So each requires their own function call. Therefore, I should generate two tool calls for get_artwork_price with the respective parameters. Then, the system can process each and maybe compute the average. But the user's question is phrased as \"average price of a... and a...\", so the answer would be the average of the two prices. However, the functions can't compute averages, so the user might need to get each price first. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture separately. That's two function calls. Let me make sure I have all the parameters right. Each call needs museum_location, material, and size as an array. Yes. So the two calls are:\n\nFirst call: get_artwork_price(museum_location=\"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4])\n\nSecond call: get_artwork_price(museum_location=\"New York\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3])\n\nI think that's all.

The user has a few different tasks here, so I need to break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, they want to modify a painting. The original attributes are 24x36 inches, acrylic, and blue. The changes are to 30x40 inches, oil, and red. Looking at the functions available, there's 'modify_painting' which takes size, medium, and dominant_color. All required parameters are provided except dominant_color is optional but they want to change it to red. So I need to call modify_painting with size=30x40, medium=oil, dominant_color=red.\n\nNext, predicting the evolutionary rate of African elephants for 100 years using the Darwin model. The 'prediction.evolution' function requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, and model is Darwin. So that function call should include those parameters.\n\nThen, calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker. The 'calculate_probability' function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user mentions 4 favorable outcomes out of 52 cards. Wait, but in poker, a royal flush is 4 possible combinations. So total_outcomes is 52, favorable is 4. They also want it rounded to 3 decimals. So the parameters would be total_outcomes=52, favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, all required fields are there. For evolution, species and years are required, model is optional but specified. For probability, both required parameters are given, and round_to is optional but specified. So all three function calls are valid."}

First, they want to predict the house price. The details given are San Francisco, 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. The predict_house_price function requires area, rooms, year, and location. All these are provided, so I can call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they need information on lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs the entity (John Doe) and county (San Francisco). The state is optional, defaulting to California, which matches the user's mention of San Francisco, CA. So I'll use that function with entity=\"John Doe\" and county=\"San Francisco\".\n\nLastly, the probability of winning a lottery with 1000 total outcomes and 5 favorable, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, and round_to=3. That's straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. No missing parameters here. Each function call is necessary and possible. So I'll list all three function calls in the response."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during Summer. The get_collectables_in_season function seems right here. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. They specified fish, so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function fits. Parameters are game, platform, and region. So game is Fortnite, platform is PlayStation, and region is Asia.\n\nThen, they want lawsuit details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function requires company_name, year, and optionally case_type. Since case_type isn't mentioned, I'll omit it or set it to default.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability calculation with 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All parameters are provided here.\n\nI need to check if all required parameters are present. For each function, the required fields are there. No missing info. So I can proceed to call each function in order."}
