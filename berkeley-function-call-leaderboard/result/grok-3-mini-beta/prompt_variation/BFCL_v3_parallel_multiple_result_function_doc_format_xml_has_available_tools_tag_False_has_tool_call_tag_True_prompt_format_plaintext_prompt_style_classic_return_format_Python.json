Prominent art movements in Italy during the 19th century.\n\nI have the following functions available:\n\n- european_history.get_events: This can get major historical events for a country and century. It has an optional event_type that defaults to 'war', which is perfect for the second part.\n\n- european_history.get_monarchs: This gets a list of monarchs for a country and century, which matches the first part.\n\n- european_history.get_culture: This gets information on cultural trends, including art movements, for a country and century. It has an optional aspect that defaults to 'art', which fits the third part.\n\nSo, I need to make function calls for each of these.\n\nFor the first part: Monarchs of France in the 17th century.\n\n- Function: european_history.get_monarchs\n\n- Parameters: country=\"France\", century=17 (since 17th century is 1600s, and the function says for 1700s, input '18', so for 1600s, it's 17).\n\nFor the second part: Major wars in England during the 18th century.\n\n- Function: european_history.get_events\n\n- Parameters: country=\"England\", century=18, event_type=\"war\" (which is the default, but I can specify it).\n\nFor the third part: Prominent art movements in Italy during the 19th century.\n\n- Function: european_history.get_culture\n\n- Parameters: country=\"Italy\", century=19, aspect=\"art\" (which is the default, but I can specify it).\n\nI need to make one or more function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.
