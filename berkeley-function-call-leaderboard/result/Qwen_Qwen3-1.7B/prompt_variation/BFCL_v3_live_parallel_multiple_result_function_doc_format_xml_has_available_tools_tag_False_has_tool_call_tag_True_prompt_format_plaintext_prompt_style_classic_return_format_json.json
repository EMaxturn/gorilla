The other parameters are optional, so they can be omitted unless needed. \n\nThen for the drink, the function ChaDri.change_drink is appropriate. The drink_id is \"123\", and the new_preferences need to include the drink type, size, sweetness, and milk.

The user wants to perform several actions in a specific order. Let me break down each step and see which functions I can use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function seems perfect here. The parameters needed are repo_url and optionally destination. Since the user provided the URL, I'll use that. The destination isn't specified, so I'll leave it out, defaulting to the current directory.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. For this, the create_a_docker_file function is needed. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. But wait, the cloned repo is already in the local directory. So I need to make sure the directory name is correct. Maybe the cloned repo's directory is the one where the Dockerfile will be created. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function is appropriate here. The parameters include directory_name, which again should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type are optional. Since the user didn't specify them, I'll use defaults where possible. But I need to check if the function requires them. The description says they are optional, so I can omit them.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git. The push_git_changes_to_github function is for pushing changes. The parameters are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't specified commit message or branch, so I'll use defaults. The function's description says it automatically adds all changes, so maybe the commit message is optional. But the user might want to commit and push. However, the step says to add all changes first, then commit and push. Wait, the step says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is the same as git add. Then commit and push. But the push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe that's the process. But the user might need to commit first. However, the function's parameters don't mention commit message, so maybe the function handles that. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. But the function's description says it pushes all changes, so perhaps the steps are: add, then commit and push. But the function might handle the commit and push. However, the user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes, which is the same as git add. Then commit and push. But the function's parameters don't include commit message, so maybe the function will handle the commit and push. But the user's step 3 is to add, then commit and push. However, the function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe the steps are: add, then push. But the user's step 3 is to add, then commit and push. But the function might handle the commit and push. However, the user might need to specify the commit message. But since the user didn't provide it, maybe the function uses a default. Alternatively, maybe the function's parameters are for pushing, and the commit is handled internally. But the user's step 3 is to add all changes, which is the git add command. Then commit and push. But the function's parameters don't include commit message, so perhaps the function will handle the commit and push. However, the user's step 3 is to add, then commit and push. So maybe the function is called with the directory_name, and the commit message is optional. But the user's step 3 says to commit and push, so perhaps the function is called with the directory_name, and the commit message is the default. But I need to check the function's parameters. The push_git_changes_to_github function has a commit_message parameter, which is optional. So maybe the user's step 3 is to call this function with the directory_name, and the commit message is the default. But the user hasn't provided a commit message, so maybe the function uses a default. However, the user's step 3 is to add all changes, then commit and push. So the steps would be: first, clone the repo, then create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then add changes, then commit and push. So the functions to call are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\" (assuming the cloned repo is in that directory)\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\"\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\" (assuming the repo is in that directory)\n\nBut wait, the clone_repo function's destination is optional. If the user didn't specify, the default is the current directory. So the cloned repo will be in the current directory. Then the directory_name for create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. So the directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\" (assuming the cloned repo is in that directory). But the actual directory name might be different. However, the user's step 1 is to clone the repo, so the directory name is the cloned repo's path. But the user hasn't specified the exact path, so I'll assume that the directory name is \"nodejs-welcome\" as given in the repo URL.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo with repo_url \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\ncreate_a_docker_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\npush_git_changes_to_github with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\nBut I need to check if the functions are called in the correct order. The user's steps are 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4. So the functions are called in that order. The push_git_changes_to_github is called after the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs are created. But the user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes, which is the same as git add. Then commit and push. However, the push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe that's the process. So the functions are called in the order given.\n\nNow, checking the parameters for each function:\n\nclone_repo: repo_url is provided, destination is optional.\n\ncreate_a_docker_file: directory_name is required.\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name is required.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github: directory_name is required.\n\nSo the function calls are as above. The user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes, which is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function. But the function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe that's the process. Therefore, the functions are called in the order given."}

The user is encountering a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the 'get_relevant_classes' function seems appropriate. The parameters required are a search string, case sensitivity, and include_subdirectories. The search string here would be 'CellResult', and since they want subdirectories, include_subdirectories should be true.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. However, the parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user is asking for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. So I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The include_private parameter is optional, but since the user is overriding methods, it's probably safe to leave it as false unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides several methods. So the 'get_signature' function needs to be called with class_name as 'AbstractCellHandler' and method_name as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private can be false unless the user wants to include private methods, but since the user is overriding public methods, it's likely false.\n\nSo the plan is: call get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true. Then call get_signature twice, once for each method. The parameters for each call would be class_name as 'AbstractCellHandler' and method_name as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue', with include_private set to false.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The 'get_relevant_classes' function's parameters are search_string, case_sensitive (default false), and include_subdirectories (default false). So setting include_subdirectories to true. The search_string is 'CellResult'.\n\nFor the get_signature calls, the parameters are class_name, method_name, and include_private. So each call will have class_name as 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue', and include_private as false.\n\nI should check if the functions are available. The functions listed include get_relevant_classes, get_signature, and get_imports. The user isn't asking about imports, so get_imports isn't needed here.\n\nSo the final answer will have two function calls: one for get_relevant_classes and two for get_signature."}

The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\". The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I can leave it out.

So first, call Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex maybe false or not specified. But the user didn't mention unisex, so maybe just call it with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex as false or not provided. However, the function's is_unisex is optional. So the first function call would be Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex as false (assuming the user wants a gender-specific salon). But the user didn't specify, so maybe just call it with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex as false. Then, once the stylist is found, use Services_1_BookAppointment with the stylist_name as 'Elegant Styles', appointment_time '15:00', and appointment_date '2023-05-10'.\n\nBut the user's question is to do both: search and book. So the assistant needs to make two function calls. First, find the stylist in Sunnyvale, then book the appointment with Elegant Styles. However, the functions are separate. So the first step is to call Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex as false (assuming the user wants a gender-specific salon). Then, call Services_1_BookAppointment with the stylist_name as 'Elegant Styles', appointment_time '15:00', and appointment_date '2023-05-10'.\n\nBut the user didn't specify whether the salon is unisex, so maybe the is_unisex parameter is not provided. The function allows it to be optional. So the first function call would be Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex as false (or not provided). Then the second function call is Services_1_BookAppointment with the given parameters."}
