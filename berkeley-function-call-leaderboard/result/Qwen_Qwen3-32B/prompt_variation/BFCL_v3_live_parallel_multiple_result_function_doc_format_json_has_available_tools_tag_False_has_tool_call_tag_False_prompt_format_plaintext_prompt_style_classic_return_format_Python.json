The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. So for the food part, I need to use the ChaFod function. The parameters required are foodItem, and optionally newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients mentioned, so that can be default or empty. No special instructions mentioned either.\n\nThen for the drink, they mentioned order ID 123. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences is a dictionary with size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type, etc. The user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. So size is 'large', temperature is 'hot', sweetness_level 'regular', milk_type 'almond'. The drink_id is '123'. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For ChaFod, the removeIngredients is a comma-separated string, but here it's just one item. So \"anchovies\" is fine. For the drink, the new_preferences should be a dict with those parameters. Let me check the enum values to make sure they match. Size 'large' is valid, temperature 'hot' is allowed, sweetness_level 'regular' is correct, and milk_type 'almond' is in the enum. \n\nSo the function calls should be two separate ones: one for the food and one for the drink. The user didn't mention any new ingredients or special instructions for the salad beyond removing anchovies. The drink has all the required parameters. I think that's all."}

The user is asking for the latest news reports for two different locations: Paris, France, and Letterkenny, Ireland. Both need to be in English, and for Letterkenny, they specifically want technology news.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's get_news_report which takes location, category, and language. The parameters are required for location, and category and language have defaults. \n\nFor Paris, France, the location is specified as 'Paris, France', which fits the required format. The user wants it in English, which is the default language, so I don't need to specify that unless necessary. The category isn't mentioned for Paris, so it should default to General.\n\nThen, for Letterkenny, Ireland. The location would be 'Letterkenny, Ireland'. The user wants technology news here, so the category needs to be set to Technology. Language is again English, which is the default, so no need to include unless specified. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls. The first one for Paris with location and default parameters, and the second one for Letterkenny with location and category set to Technology. Since the user mentioned \"again in English\", but since the default is already English, maybe it's redundant but including it explicitly might be better to avoid confusion. Wait, the function's language parameter has a default of 'en', so even if not specified, it's English. But the user specified English for both, so maybe include it to be explicit. However, the default is already 'en', so it's optional. But the user might want to ensure it's in English, so including it would make it clear. \n\nWait, looking at the parameters for get_news_report: the language enum includes 'en' as default. So for both locations, since the user wants English, we can rely on the default. But maybe the user wants to be explicit. However, the function will use 'en' by default, so including it is optional. But to be safe, perhaps include it. Alternatively, since the user specified \"in English\" for both, maybe include the language parameter to make sure. \n\nSo for Paris: get_news_report(location='Paris, France', language='en') and for Letterkenny: get_news_report(location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en'). But since language defaults to 'en', maybe it's redundant. However, the user explicitly mentioned English, so including it would be better. \n\nAlso, check if the locations are correctly formatted. Paris, France is correct. Letterkenny, Ireland is correct as per the function's required format. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. get_news_report with location='Paris, France', language='en' (category defaults to General)\n2. get_news_report with location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en'\n\nYes, that should cover both requests."}

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination is optional, but since the next steps refer to the repo directory, maybe I should clone it to a specific directory. Wait, the default is the current directory, so maybe just use that. So call clone_repo with repo_url.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory_name would be the repo's root. Let's say the repo is cloned into a directory named 'nodejs-welcome'. Wait, but the clone_repo function's destination is '.', so the repo is cloned into the current directory. So the directory_name for analysis would be 'nodejs-welcome'? Or maybe the function expects the directory where the repo is cloned. Hmm, the user didn't specify a different directory, so probably the root. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create/update Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. So after analysis, assuming the directory is 'nodejs-welcome', call that function with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function also needs directory_name. So same directory. But the other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter modifying files, need to push changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name. Again, the repo is in 'nodejs-welcome'? Or maybe the current directory. Wait, the clone was done to '.', so the directory_name for push would be the repo's directory. But the user might have cloned it into a subdirectory. Wait, the initial clone_repo's destination is default '.', so if the repo is cloned into the current directory, then the directory_name for push would be the name of the cloned repo's directory. Assuming the repo URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, the cloned directory would be 'nodejs-welcome'. So the push function's directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. Commit message is default 'Update changes', branch is 'main' by default.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo's contents.\n3. Create Dockerfile.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs.\n5. Push changes.\n\nEach step requires a function call. The parameters need to be correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters.\n\nFor clone_repo: repo_url is required. The user provided git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So that's the repo_url. The destination is optional, default is '.', so no need to specify. So first function call is clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git').\n\nThen analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nThen create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nThen create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nFinally, push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main').\n\nWait, the user step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So the push function handles adding, committing, and pushing. So the push function call should handle that. So the steps are covered by these function calls."}

They're working on a Java project and encountering a compilation error related to the 'StringNumberHandler' class extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The specific issue is that 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and since they didn't mention case sensitivity, I'll default to case-insensitive.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides. The 'get_signature' function is the right choice here. For each method, I'll call the function with 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and the respective 'method_name'. The 'include_private' parameter is optional and defaults to False, which should be fine unless the methods are private, but that's unlikely for methods meant to be overridden.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided. For 'get_relevant_classes', 'search_string' is required, which is given. For 'get_signature', both 'class_name' and 'method_name' are required. Since the user mentioned Java, but the functions don't specify language, I assume the functions handle Java classes as well. The parameters for the functions are in Python syntax, but the functions themselves are part of the tool, so the user's Java context is handled by the tool's internal logic.\n\nI should generate two calls to 'get_signature' for each method and one call to 'get_relevant_classes'. Also, check if any parameters are missing. The 'module_name' in 'get_class_info' isn't needed here since the user is asking for signatures, not the entire class info. So the correct approach is to use 'get_signature' for each method and 'get_relevant_classes' for 'CellResult'."}

The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned 5 cm, so the size is 5. The unit here is centimeters, but the function doesn't mention handling units, just the numerical value. So I'll use size=5.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a 'location' parameter. Queenstown is a place in Singapore, so the location should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The function also allows specifying 'unit' for temperature, but the user didn't specify, so it will default to Fahrenheit. However, since Singapore uses Celsius, maybe I should set unit='celsius'? But the user didn't specify, so maybe stick to the default. Wait, the function's default is Fahrenheit, but the location is Singapore, which typically uses Celsius. Hmm, but the user didn't specify, so perhaps it's better to use the default unless instructed otherwise. Or maybe include the unit parameter to ensure it's in Celsius. The user might expect Celsius for Singapore. Let me check the function parameters again. The 'unit' parameter has a default of 'fahrenheit', but the user might want Celsius. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should just provide the default and let the function handle it, or include unit='celsius' for accuracy. Since the user is asking for the weather in Singapore, which uses Celsius, I'll include unit='celsius' to make it more relevant.\n\nSo, two function calls: one for the area and one for the weather. Both functions are available, so no issues there. Parameters are provided correctly. Need to format the location correctly as 'Queenstown, Singapore' to match the required format."}

Or does the function allow multiple event types in one call? Looking at the parameters, event_type is a single string, not an array. So to cover both, I need to make two separate calls.

So I need to call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once with 'Music' and once with 'Theater', both in Los Angeles on 2023-03-10. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if passed as a list, but the enum only lists 'Music' and 'Theater' as separate options.
