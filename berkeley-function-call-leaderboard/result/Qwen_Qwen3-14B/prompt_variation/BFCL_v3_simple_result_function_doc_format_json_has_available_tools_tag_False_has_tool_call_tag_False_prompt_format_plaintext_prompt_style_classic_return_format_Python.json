The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height is given as 150 meters. The initial velocity is specified as zero, which matches the default value in the function parameters. The gravity isn't mentioned, so it should use the default of 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, I should call the function with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81.

The user mentioned \"pet friendly,\" which is one of the enum options in the preferences array. The function allows specifying preferences as an array of strings from the enum. Since the user only specified pet_friendly, I should include that in the preferences array. The default is all if not specified, but here the user is specific, so only pet_friendly is needed.\n\nI need to format the start_date as a string. The user said March 10th, 2023. The function's start_date parameter is a string, so I can use \"2023-03-10\" as the date format. \n\nPutting it all together: call hotel_booking with location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"2023-03-10\", preferences=[\"pet_friendly\"]."}
