So, I need to use data from a file called \"dataset.csv\" and fit a linear regression model to predict future sales. Specifically, I'm supposed to set x as the 'sales' data and y as 'future_sales', and also calculate the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data from \"dataset.csv\". I see there's a function called \"data_loading\" that can help with that. It takes a file_path as a string and optionally a delimiter, which defaults to ','. Since the file is a csv, I can probably use the default delimiter.\n\nSo, I'll call the data_loading function with file_path set to 'dataset.csv'. Once the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns to use as x and y in the linear regression.\n\nFor fitting the linear regression model, there's a function called \"linear_regression_fit\". It takes x and y as lists, and there's an optional parameter return_residuals which is set to False by default. Since the task says to calculate and return the residuals, I need to set return_residuals to True.\n\nSo, after loading the data, I'll extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns into lists and pass them to the linear_regression_fit function with return_residuals set to True.\n\nI think that's the plan.

The first is a 4 ft x 4 ft marble statue in the Philadelphia museum, and the second is a 6 ft x 3 ft bronze sculpture in the New York museum. To get the prices, I need to retrieve details about each sculpture, including their materials and sizes, and then use that information to find out their prices.\n\nFirst, I need to get the details of the marble statue in Philadelphia. I know the museum location is Philadelphia, and I need to find the sculpture ID for the marble statue. But since I don't have the sculpture ID, I might need to search for it somehow. However, the function `get_sculpture_details` requires the museum location and the sculpture ID. Without the ID, I can't directly use this function.\n\nWait, maybe I can assume that the sculpture ID is provided or known. For the sake of proceeding, let's assume that for the Philadelphia marble statue, the sculpture ID is 123, and for the New York bronze sculpture, the ID is 456. These are just hypothetical IDs for the purpose of making function calls.\n\nSo, for the Philadelphia marble statue:\n\n- Museum location: Philadelphia\n\n- Sculpture ID: 123\n\nI'll call the `get_sculpture_details` function with these parameters to get the material and size.\n\nSimilarly, for the New York bronze sculpture:\n\n- Museum location: New York\n\n- Sculpture ID: 456\n\nAgain, I'll use the `get_sculpture_details` function to retrieve its material and size.\n\nOnce I have the materials and sizes, I can use the `get_artwork_price` function to find out the prices for each sculpture.\n\nAfter getting both prices, I can calculate the average price by adding them together and dividing by two.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get details of the Philadelphia marble statue using `get_sculpture_details`.\n\n2. Get details of the New York bronze sculpture using `get_sculpture_details`.\n\n3. Use the details to get the price of each sculpture using `get_artwork_price`.\n\n4. Calculate the average price.\n\nI need to make sure that the dimensions are provided in the correct format for the `get_artwork_price` function. The sculpture sizes should be provided as lists of dimensions.\n\nFor example, for the Philadelphia statue, the size is 4 ft x 4 ft, which might be a square, so perhaps it's a 2D representation. But sculptures can be 3D, so I might need to assume a third dimension or check if it's provided in the details.\n\nSimilarly, for the New York sculpture, it's 6 ft x 3 ft, which might also need a third dimension.\n\nI should also ensure that the material is correctly specified, as it affects the price.\n\nAssuming that the `get_sculpture_details` function provides all necessary details, including any additional dimensions or specifics about the sculpture, I can proceed.\n\nOnce I have all the required information, I can call `get_artwork_price` for each sculpture and then compute the average price.\n\nLet me consider that the `get_sculpture_details` function returns the material and size in a standardized format that can be directly used by `get_artwork_price`.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by first calling `get_sculpture_details` for both sculptures, then use those details to call `get_artwork_price`, and finally calculate the average price.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the average price of two different sculptures located in different museums. Specifically, we are looking for the price of a 4 ft x 4 ft marble statue in the Philadelphia museum and a 6 ft x 3 ft bronze sculpture in the New York museum. We will achieve this by retrieving the details of each sculpture and then obtaining their respective prices.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Retrieve Sculpture Details:**\n   - Use the `get_sculpture_details` function to fetch the material and size of each sculpture.\n   \n2. **Get Artwork Prices:**\n   - Use the `get_artwork_price` function with the retrieved details to find the price of each sculpture.\n   \n3. **Calculate Average Price:**\n   - Compute the average price by summing the prices of both sculptures and dividing by two.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Assuming the functions are available in the environment\nfrom museum_api import get_sculpture_details, get_artwork_price\n\n# Define the museum locations and sculpture IDs\nphiladelphia_museum = \"Philadelphia\"\nnew_york_museum = \"New York\"\nmarble_statue_id = 123  # Hypothetical ID for the marble statue in Philadelphia\nbronze_sculpture_id = 456  # Hypothetical ID for the bronze sculpture in New York\n\n# Step 1: Get details of the marble statue in Philadelphia\nmarble_details = get_sculpture_details(museum_location=philadelphia_museum, sculpture_id=marble_statue_id)\n\n# Step 2: Get details of the bronze sculpture in New York\nbronze_details = get_sculpture_details(museum_location=new_york_museum, sculpture_id=bronze_sculpture_id)\n\n# Step 3: Get the price of each sculpture\nmarble_price = get_artwork_price(\n    museum_location=philadelphia_museum,\n    sculpture_material=marble_details['material'],\n    sculpture_size=marble_details['size']\n)\n\nbronze_price = get_artwork_price(\n    museum_location=new_york_museum,\n    sculpture_material=bronze_details['material'],\n    sculpture_size=bronze_details['size']\n)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the average price\naverage_price = (marble_price + bronze_price) / 2\n\nprint(f\"The average price of the sculptures is: ${average_price:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Retrieve Sculpture Details:**\n   - We use the `get_sculpture_details` function to fetch the material and size of each sculpture by providing the museum location and sculpture ID.\n   \n2. **Get Artwork Prices:**\n   - With the details obtained, we use the `get_artwork_price` function to determine the price of each sculpture by specifying the museum location, material, and size.\n   \n3. **Calculate Average Price:**\n   - Finally, we calculate the average price by adding the prices of both sculptures and dividing by two, then print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately retrieve and utilize the necessary information to compute the average price of the specified sculptures.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming glucose. I know that the bacteria consumed 5 moles of glucose, and each mole of glucose produces 2800 kJ of energy. So, the total energy should be the amount of glucose consumed multiplied by the energy per mole.\n\nLooking at the functions I have, there's one called `biological.calc_energy`. It takes the number of moles, the substance formula, and an optional joules per mole value. In this case, the substance is glucose (C6H12O6), and the default joules per mole is 2800.0, which matches what I have.\n\nSo, I can call `biological.calc_energy` with mols=5 and substance='C6H12O6'. Since the joules_per_mol is already set to 2800.0 by default, I don't need to specify it unless I want to change it.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\". I need to make sure that the units are consistent. The function probably expects joules, not kilojoules. So, 2800 kJ is 2,800,000 joules. I need to check the function's documentation to see what units it uses.\n\nAssuming that the function expects joules, I should convert 2800 kJ to joules. 1 kJ = 1000 J, so 2800 kJ = 2,800,000 J. But the default is 2800.0, which might be in kJ, so I need to clarify.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume that the function's joules_per_mol parameter is in kilojoules per mole, so I can keep the values in kJ. If the function expects joules, I'll adjust accordingly.\n\nMoving on, after calculating the total energy produced, I need to calculate the biomass produced by the bacteria. The conversion efficiency is 10%, meaning that only 10% of the energy from glucose is converted into biomass.\n\nThere's a function called `biological.calc_biomass` that calculates biomass from energy given the conversion efficiency. It takes energy as a float and an optional efficiency parameter, which defaults to 0.1 (10%).\n\nSo, I can use this function by passing the total energy calculated in the first step and the efficiency if it's different from the default.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the work done by the machine. The machine moves a distance of 2 meters, and I need to use the total energy produced by the bacteria to calculate the work done.\n\nThere's a function called `physical.calc_work` that calculates work from energy and distance. It takes energy and distance as floats.\n\nSo, I can call this function with the total energy and the distance of 2 meters.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the energy used for work is the same as the energy produced by the bacteria. However, in reality, there might be additional efficiencies or losses in the process of converting biomass energy into mechanical work, but the problem doesn't specify any other efficiencies, so I'll assume that the entire energy from biomass is used to do work.\n\nBut actually, looking back, the problem says: \"calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\"\n\nSo, it's asking to calculate work directly from the total energy produced and the distance, without considering the biomass step in between. But earlier, it asked to calculate biomass from energy and efficiency.\n\nI think there might be a confusion here. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nFirst, calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming glucose.\n\nSecond, calculate the amount of biomass produced by the bacteria given the energy produced and the conversion efficiency.\n\nThird, calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\n\nWait, but the total energy produced by the bacteria is before considering the conversion efficiency. The biomass is only a portion of that energy, 10% in this case.\n\nSo, for the work done by the machine, should I use the total energy produced by the bacteria or the energy converted into biomass?\n\nThe problem says: \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\"\n\nSo, it seems I should use the total energy produced, not the biomass energy.\n\nBut perhaps the machine is powered by the biomass, in which case I should use the energy equivalent of the biomass.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me think differently. The bacteria consume glucose and produce energy, part of which is converted into biomass (10% efficiency). Then, this biomass is used to power the machine.\n\nSo, the energy available to do work is the energy stored in the biomass, which is 10% of the total energy produced from glucose.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the work done by the machine, I should use the energy from biomass and the distance.\n\nBut the problem says to use the total energy produced by the bacteria, but according to the earlier reasoning, it should be the energy from biomass.\n\nI need to resolve this inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is directly powered by the energy produced by the bacteria, and the biomass is just a byproduct. In that case, the total energy available for work is the energy produced minus the energy converted into biomass.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. Perhaps the machine is fueled by the biomass, meaning that the energy used for work comes from the biomass.\n\nTo simplify, I'll proceed with the assumption that the energy available for work is the energy converted into biomass.\n\nSo, first, calculate the total energy produced from glucose.\n\nThen, calculate the energy converted into biomass using the conversion efficiency.\n\nFinally, use that biomass energy to calculate the work done by the machine over a distance of 2 meters.\n\nNow, let's think about the functions I have:\n\n1. `biological.calc_energy(mols, substance, joules_per_mol=2800.0)`: calculates energy from amount of substance.\n\n2. `biological.calc_biomass(energy, efficiency=0.1)`: calculates biomass from energy and efficiency.\n\n3. `physical.calc_work(energy, distance)`: calculates work from energy and distance.\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the total energy produced from 5 moles of glucose. I can use `biological.calc_energy` for this, with mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', and joules_per_mol=2800.0 (assuming it's in kJ/mol).\n\nThen, calculate the biomass energy, which is 10% of the total energy, using `biological.calc_biomass` with energy equal to the result from the first step and efficiency=0.1.\n\nFinally, calculate the work done by the machine using `physical.calc_work`, with energy equal to the biomass energy and distance=2 meters.\n\nBut I need to make sure about the units. If energy is in kJ, and distance is in meters, what units will work be in? Joules, newtons, or something else?\n\nWait, in physics, work is calculated as force times distance. But here, the function `physical.calc_work` takes energy and distance as inputs. Is this a standard function, or is it custom-defined for this problem?\n\nI need to know how `physical.calc_work` is implemented. If it's simply work = energy * distance, that doesn't make sense dimensionally, because energy is force times distance. So, perhaps it's defined differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's calculating the work that can be done with a certain amount of energy, assuming no losses, so work equals energy.\n\nBut in that case, the distance parameter is unnecessary. Maybe the function is defined as work = energy * distance, which doesn't align with physical principles.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Perhaps I should check the documentation for `physical.calc_work`.\n\nAssuming that `physical.calc_work` is correctly implemented according to physical principles, and it calculates work as energy expended over a distance, perhaps it's considering the force applied over that distance.\n\nBut without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to be sure.\n\nTo proceed, I'll assume that `physical.calc_work` correctly calculates the work done given energy and distance.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n1. Calculate total energy from glucose using `biological.calc_energy`.\n\n2. Calculate biomass energy using `biological.calc_biomass`.\n\n3. Calculate work done by the machine using `physical.calc_work`, with the biomass energy and the distance.\n\nNow, let's think about the parameters.\n\nFor `biological.calc_energy`:\n\n- mols: 5 (moles of glucose)\n\n- substance: 'C6H12O6'\n\n- joules_per_mol: 2800.0 (assuming it's in kJ/mol)\n\nFor `biological.calc_biomass`:\n\n- energy: output from step 1\n\n- efficiency: 0.1 (10%)\n\nFor `physical.calc_work`:\n\n- energy: output from step 2\n\n- distance: 2 meters\n\nI need to ensure that the units are consistent across these functions. If `biological.calc_energy` returns energy in kJ, and `physical.calc_work` expects energy in J, I need to convert kJ to J.\n\nSimilarly, distance is in meters, which is standard.\n\nI should check the return units of each function to ensure they are compatible.\n\nAssuming that `biological.calc_energy` returns energy in kJ, and `physical.calc_work` expects energy in J, I need to convert kJ to J by multiplying by 1000.\n\nAlso, efficiency is a decimal fraction, so 10% is 0.1, which is correct.\n\nAlright, with that in mind, I can proceed to make the function calls accordingly.\n\nFirst, call `biological.calc_energy` with mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', and joules_per_mol=2800.0.\n\nThen, take that energy, multiply it by efficiency (0.1) in `biological.calc_biomass`.\n\nFinally, convert the biomass energy to joules and call `physical.calc_work` with that energy and distance=2 meters.\n\nWait, but `biological.calc_biomass` already takes energy and efficiency, so I don't need to multiply it myself.\n\nSo, I can pass the total energy and efficiency to `biological.calc_biomass`, and it will handle the calculation.\n\nThen, use the output from `biological.calc_biomass` as the energy input for `physical.calc_work`, after converting units if necessary.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy produced by bacteria from consuming glucose, the biomass produced from this energy, and finally, the work done by a machine powered by this biomass. We will use the provided functions to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Calculate Total Energy Produced:**\n   - Use the `biological.calc_energy` function to calculate the total energy produced from the consumption of glucose.\n   - Parameters: mols=5 (moles of glucose), substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800.0 (in kJ/mol).\n\n2. **Calculate Biomass Produced:**\n   - Use the `biological.calc_biomass` function to calculate the biomass produced from the total energy with a given conversion efficiency.\n   - Parameters: energy (from step 1), efficiency=0.1 (10%).\n\n3. **Calculate Work Done by the Machine:**\n   - Use the `physical.calc_work` function to calculate the work done by the machine over a specified distance.\n   - Parameters: energy (from step 2), distance=2 meters.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```xml\n<functions>\n    <function name=\"biological.calc_energy\">\n        <params>\n            <param name=\"mols\" value=\"5\" type=\"float\"/>\n            <param name=\"substance\" value=\"C6H12O6\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"joules_per_mol\" value=\"2800.0\" type=\"float\"/>\n        </params>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"biological.calc_biomass\">\n        <params>\n            <param name=\"energy\" value=\"{{\u751f\u7269.calc_energy.result}}\" type=\"float\"/>\n            <param name=\"efficiency\" value=\"0.1\" type=\"float\"/>\n        </params>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"physical.calc_work\">\n        <params>\n            <param name=\"energy\" value=\"{{\u751f\u7269.calc_biomass.result}}\" type=\"float\"/>\n            <param name=\"distance\" value=\"2\" type=\"float\"/>\n        </params>\n    </function>\n</functions>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Calculate Total Energy Produced:**\n   - The `biological.calc_energy` function computes the total energy produced from 5 moles of glucose, assuming each mole yields 2800 kJ.\n\n2. **Calculate Biomass Produced:**\n   - The `biological.calc_biomass` function calculates the biomass produced from the total energy, considering a 10% conversion efficiency.\n\n3. **Calculate Work Done by the Machine:**\n   - The `physical.calc_work` function determines the work done by the machine using the energy equivalent of the biomass over a distance of 2 meters.\n\nThis sequence ensures that we accurately compute the energy flow from glucose consumption to mechanical work performed by the machine.", "possible_answer": [{"biological.calc_energy": {"mols": [5.0], "substance": ["C6H12O6", "glucose"], "joules_per_mol": [2800.0, ""]}}, {"biological.calc_biomass": {"energy": [14000.0], "efficiency": [0.1, ""]}}, {"physical.calc_work": {"energy": [1400.0], "distance": [2.0]}}]}

For that, I can use the `player_stats.get_all_time_goals` function. I'll need to provide the player's name and the team's name, and specify the competition as the Premier League.\n\nSo, I'll call:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"player_stats.get_all_time_goals\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"player_name\" value=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"team_name\" value=\"Manchester United\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"competition\" value=\"Premier League\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nNext, I need to find the top scorer of Manchester United in the Premier League.

I'll set the ingredients to eggs, milk, and bread, and set the calories to 300. Since it's breakfast, I'll specify that as the meal type.\n\nNext, for lunch, you want to find a restaurant that serves dishes with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, and the dishes should be no more than 500 calories. I can use the `restaurant_search` function for this. I'll input the ingredients as chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, set the calories to 500, and specify that it's for lunch.\n\nFinally, for dinner, you have a recipe that uses beef, but you want to replace it with tofu and keep the calories under 600. For this, I'll use the `ingredient_replace` function. I'll set the original ingredient to beef, the replacement to tofu, and set the calories to 600.\n\nLet me make sure I have all the parameters correct for each function. For `recipe_search`, I need a list of ingredients and the maximum calories, and optionally the meal type. For `restaurant_search`, it's similar: a list of preferred ingredients, maximum calories, and optionally the meal type. And for `ingredient_replace`, I need the original ingredient, the replacement ingredient, and the maximum calories.\n\nOkay, so for breakfast, I'll call `recipe_search` with ingredients ['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories 300, and meal 'breakfast'.\n\nFor lunch, I'll call `restaurant_search` with ingredients ['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories 500, and meal 'lunch'.\n\nFor dinner, I'll call `ingredient_replace` with original_ingredient 'beef', replacement_ingredient 'tofu', and calories 600.\n\nI think that covers all your requests.

The current details are: it's 24x36 inches, done in acrylic with a dominant color of blue. I want to change the size to 30x40 inches, switch the medium to oil, and make the dominant color red. To do this, I'll use the `modify_painting` function. Let's see what parameters it needs.\n\nThe `modify_painting` function requires the following arguments:\n\n- `size` (str): The size of the painting in inches, width by height.\n\n- `medium` (str): The medium of the painting, such as oil, acrylic, etc.\n\n- `dominant_color` (str): The dominant color of the painting. Default is 'Blue'.\n\nSo, I need to provide the new size, medium, and dominant color. The size should be \"30x40 inches\", medium should be \"oil\", and dominant color should be \"red\". I need to make sure that the size is specified correctly, with width and height in inches.\n\nNext, I need to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant species for the next 100 years using the Darwin model. For this, I'll use the `prediction.evolution` function. Let's check what arguments it requires.\n\nThe `prediction.evolution` function needs:\n\n- `species` (str): The species for which the evolution rate will be predicted.\n\n- `years` (int): Number of years for the prediction.\n\n- `model` (str): The model used to make the prediction, options are 'Darwin' or 'Lamarck', with 'Darwin' as the default.\n\nSo, I need to specify the species as \"African elephant\", the number of years as 100, and the model as 'Darwin'.\n\nLastly, I need to calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in a game of poker. I know that in a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible royal flushes. I need to calculate the probability of being dealt one of these hands. To do this, I'll use the `calculate_probability` function. Let's see what arguments it takes.\n\nThe `calculate_probability` function requires:\n\n- `total_outcomes` (int): Total number of possible outcomes.\n\n- `favorable_outcomes` (int): Number of outcomes considered as 'successful'.\n\n- `round_to` (int, optional): Number of decimal places to round the result to. Default is 2.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible 5-card hands from a 52-card deck is C(52,5), which is 2,598,960. The number of favorable outcomes is 4 (the four possible royal flushes, one for each suit). I want the result rounded to 3 decimal places, so I'll set `round_to` to 3.\n\nSo, to summarize, I need to:\n\n1. Modify the painting's attributes using `modify_painting` with size \"30x40 inches\", medium \"oil\", and dominant_color \"red\".\n\n2. Predict the evolutionary rate for the African elephant species over 100 years using the Darwin model with `prediction.evolution`.\n\n3. Calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in poker with total_outcomes=2598960, favorable_outcomes=4, and round_to=3 using `calculate_probability`.\n\nI think that covers all the tasks. Now, I need to make sure I have all the necessary information and that I'm using the functions correctly.\n\nFirst, for `modify_painting`:\n\n- size: \"30x40 inches\"\n\n- medium: \"oil\"\n\n- dominant_color: \"red\"\n\nI need to ensure that the size is formatted correctly, with both width and height included, and that the medium and color are spelled correctly.\n\nNext, for `prediction.evolution`:\n\n- species: \"African elephant\"\n\n- years: 100\n\n- model: \"Darwin\"\n\nI should confirm that \"African elephant\" is the correct species name expected by the function. If it requires a scientific name, I might need to provide that instead, like \"Loxodonta africana\". But since the function expects a string for the species, I'll proceed with \"African elephant\" unless specified otherwise.\n\nLastly, for `calculate_probability`:\n\n- total_outcomes: 2598960\n\n- favorable_outcomes: 4\n\n- round_to: 3\n\nI need to make sure that the total number of possible 5-card hands is indeed 2,598,960, which it is, and that there are only 4 royal flushes in a standard deck.\n\nAssuming all these are correct, I can proceed to make the function calls in the specified format.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo address the tasks, the following function calls need to be made:\n\n1. Modify the painting's attributes.\n2. Predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant species.\n3.
