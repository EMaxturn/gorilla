We must use that exact name.\n\n Parameters:\n   restaurant: \"uber pitada\" (string)\n   items: an array of two strings: [\"burgers\", \"chicken wings\"]\n   quantities: an array of two integers: [5, 6]\n\n We will create the function call in the required XML-like format.\n\n Also note: the types for the parameters as per the function definition:\n   - restaurant: string\n   - items: array (of strings)\n   - quantities: array (of integers)\n\n We must represent the arrays appropriately.\n\n Format for array in the value: we can write the array as a string representation? But note the instruction says the type must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. However, in the XML representation, the value must be a string? How to represent an array?\n\n Actually, the instruction says: the type field of the parameters must be one of those. But the value in the XML attribute is a string. So we must represent the array as a string that can be parsed as an array? \n\n But looking at the example in the instruction: \n   <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n   ... \n\n How would we represent an array? We might use JSON string representation.\n\n However, note the system that interprets the function call will parse the string accordingly.\n\n Since the function expects an array of strings and an array of integers, we can represent them as JSON arrays in string form.\n\n Example: \n   items: value=\"[\\\"burgers\\\", \\\"chicken wings\\\"]\" type=\"array\"\n   quantities: value=\"[5, 6]\" type=\"array\"\n\n But note: the type of the parameter is specified as \"array\" in the function definition.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent without quotes for integers? But the value is always a string. We'll use JSON.\n\n However, the problem says: the type field must be set to the type. So for items, type=\"array\", and for quantities, type=\"array\". But the function definition specifies the inner types (strings and integers). The system that runs the function will know from the function definition that the array elements are strings and integers respectively.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   <param name=\"restaurant\" value=\"uber pitada\" type=\"string\"/>\n   <param name=\"items\" value=\"[&quot;burgers&quot;, &quot;chicken wings&quot;]\" type=\"array\"/>\n   <param name=\"quantities\" value=\"[5, 6]\" type=\"array\"/>\n\n But note: we have to escape the quotes inside the value string. In XML, we can use &quot; for double quotes.\n\n However, the value attribute is in double quotes, so we must escape the inner double quotes. Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the inner strings? But the function expects strings in double quotes? Actually, the value is a string that will be parsed as an array. We'll use JSON format.\n\n Let me write the arrays in JSON without spaces to avoid extra escaping? But we can use:\n\n   items: value='[\"burgers\", \"chicken wings\"]'   -> but then the outer quote is double? We have to use double for the attribute. So:\n\n   value=\"[\\\"burgers\\\", \\\"chicken wings\\\"]\"\n\n Similarly, for quantities: value=\"[5, 6]\"\n\n But note: the function expects integers, so we don't put quotes around numbers.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the entire attribute? The instruction says the format is: <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/> -> so value is in double quotes.\n\n We must escape the double quotes inside with &quot; or with a backslash? In XML, we can use &quot; for a double quote.\n\n However, the example in the instruction does not show escaping. But note: the system that parses the function call is an XML parser. So we should use XML escaping.\n\n But let me see: the value string for items should be: \n      value=\"[&quot;burgers&quot;, &quot;chicken wings&quot;]\"\n\n But note: the array must be a string that can be parsed as an array. The function caller will parse that string as an array.\n\n Alternatively, we can use backslashes? But in XML, we can also use backslashes? Actually, XML does not require backslashes for escaping quotes; it uses &quot;.\n\n However, the system that interprets the function call might expect a JSON string. And JSON requires double quotes. So we must have double quotes around the string elements.\n\n We'll use &quot; to represent a double quote inside the attribute value.\n\n Therefore:\n   items: value=\"[&quot;burgers&quot;, &quot;chicken wings&quot;]\"\n   quantities: value=\"[5, 6]\"\n\n But note: the quantities array does not have any string, so we don't need to escape.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON string? But JSON standard requires double quotes. So we must use double quotes for the string elements.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   <function name=\"uber.eat.order\">\n      <params>\n         <param name=\"restaurant\" value=\"uber pitada\" type=\"string\"/>\n         <param name=\"items\" value=\"[&quot;burgers&quot;, &quot;chicken wings&quot;]\" type=\"array\"/>\n         <param name=\"quantities\" value=\"[5,6]\" type=\"array\"/>\n      </params>\n   </function>\n\n But note: the function requires all three parameters: restaurant, items, and quantities.\n\n We have all three.\n\n Let's write the full function call."}

Let's map the user's request to the function parameters:\n\n Required parameters for the function (as per the function definition) are:\n   - brewery\n   - taste\n   - aroma\n   - color\n   - style\n\n We have:\n   - style: 'porter' (since the user is asking for porters)\n   - aroma: 'chocolatey' (the user says \"rich, chocolatey aroma\", so we can use 'chocolatey')\n   - taste: 'slightly bitter' (but note the function expects a taste profile; we can use 'bitter' but the user says slightly so we might adjust, but the function doesn't have a scale. We can use 'bitter' and then rely on the ibu_min and ibu_max to adjust for slight bitterness. However, the taste parameter is a string. We'll set taste to 'bitter' and then use ibu_min and ibu_max to control the level? But note: the function does not have a way to specify the intensity in the taste string. Alternatively, we can describe it as 'slightly bitter'. Since the function's taste parameter is a string, we can put the exact description. The function description says it can be 'bitter', but it doesn't specify that it must be from a fixed set. So we can use the string \"slightly bitter\".)\n   - color: 'dark'\n   - brewery: 'Creek brewery'\n\n Additionally, the user says \"All other preferences are the standard ones.\" meaning we can use the default values for abv_min, abv_max, ibu_min, ibu_max, and pairings.\n\n However, note that the user specified \"slightly bitter\", so we might want to adjust the IBU range. Since the function allows ibu_min and ibu_max, we can set a range that reflects \"slightly bitter\". The standard IBU for porters can vary, but a typical porter might have an IBU between 20 and 40. We can set a range that is on the lower end of bitter, say 15 to 30. But note: the function defaults for ibu_min and ibu_max are 0 and 120. We don't have to change them if we are okay with the default. However, to reflect \"slightly bitter\", we might set:\n\n   ibu_min: 15 (to avoid very low bitterness)\n   ibu_max: 30 (to avoid high bitterness)\n\n But note: the user didn't specify numbers, so we can also leave it to the default and let the function use its own standard. However, the problem says \"standard ones\" meaning the default values? The function has defaults: abv_min=0.0, abv_max=12.5, ibu_min=0, ibu_max=120, pairings=[].\n\n But the user's request for \"slightly bitter\" might not be captured by the default ibu range. Since the function does not have a parameter for bitterness intensity, we have two choices:\n   Option 1: Only use the taste string \"slightly bitter\" and rely on the function to interpret that, and use the default ibu range.\n   Option 2: Adjust the ibu range to a lower range to reflect slight bitterness.\n\n Given that the function's taste parameter is a string, and the function may use that string for matching, we can set the taste to \"slightly bitter\". Additionally, we can set the ibu range to a narrow band that is typical for slightly bitter porters.\n\n However, note the function's description for the taste parameter: it says \"such as 'bitter', 'sweet', 'sour'\". It does not say it must be one of these, so we can use \"slightly bitter\".\n\n But to be safe, we can also set the ibu_min and ibu_max to a range that we think is appropriate for slightly bitter. Let's set:\n   ibu_min: 15\n   ibu_max: 30\n\n We are also told the brewery is preferably 'Creek brewery'. We can set that as the brewery.\n\n Since the function requires all five parameters (brewery, taste, aroma, color, style) and we have them, we can call the function.\n\n Let's set the parameters:\n\n   brewery: \"Creek brewery\"\n   taste: \"slightly bitter\"\n   aroma: \"chocolatey\"\n   color: \"dark\"\n   style: \"porter\"\n   abv_min: 0.0 (default, but we can omit because the function uses default if not provided? But note: the function call format requires us to include only the parameters we want to set. The function has defaults for abv_min, abv_max, ibu_min, ibu_max, and pairings. We are going to set ibu_min and ibu_max because we want to adjust for slight bitterness, but we leave abv_min and abv_max to default and pairings to default (empty array). However, the function call must include the required parameters, and the rest are optional.\n\n But note: the function definition says the required parameters are: ['brewery', 'taste', 'aroma', 'color', 'style'].\n\n We are setting:\n   brewery: \"Creek brewery\"\n   taste: \"slightly bitter\"\n   aroma: \"chocolatey\"\n   color: \"dark\"\n   style: \"porter\"\n\n And we also want to set:\n   ibu_min: 15\n   ibu_max: 30\n\n We are not setting abv_min, abv_max, and pairings because the user said \"standard ones\", meaning we use the defaults.\n\n However, the function has a default for ibu_min and ibu_max (0 and 120) but we are overriding them to 15 and 30 to capture the slight bitterness.\n\n Therefore, we will include ibu_min and ibu_max.\n\n So the function call will be:\n\n   find_beer(brewery=\"Creek brewery\", taste=\"slightly bitter\", aroma=\"chocolatey\", color=\"dark\", style=\"porter\", ibu_min=15, ibu_max=30)\n\n But note: the function also has abv_min and abv_max. We are not setting them, so they will default to 0.0 and 12.5. That's acceptable because the user didn't specify.\n\n Let's write the function call in the required XML format.\n\n Note: The parameters must be in the specified types. The function expects:\n   brewery: string\n   taste: string\n   aroma: string\n   color: string\n   style: string\n   ibu_min: integer\n   ibu_max: integer\n\n We are setting ibu_min and ibu_max as integers.\n\n We are not setting abv_min, abv_max, or pairings because we are using the defaults.\n\n Therefore, the XML will be:\n\n<functions>\n    <function name=\"find_beer\">\n        <params>\n            <param name=\"brewery\" value=\"Creek brewery\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"taste\" value=\"slightly bitter\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"aroma\" value=\"chocolatey\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"color\" value=\"dark\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"style\" value=\"porter\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"ibu_min\" value=\"15\" type=\"integer\"/>\n            <param name=\"ibu_max\" value=\"30\" type=\"integer\"/>\n        </params>\n    </function>\n</functions>\n\n However, note: the function also requires the required parameters, and we are including them. We are also including two optional parameters (ibu_min and ibu_max).\n\n But wait, the function definition says the required parameters are only the five. The rest are optional.\n\n We are good.\n\n But note: the user said \"preferably from Creek brewery\". The function is going to look for that brewery. If we want to allow flexibility, we might not set the brewery? But the function requires the brewery parameter. The description says: \"The brewery name to find similar beers.\" So it might be that the function uses the brewery to find similar beers from that brewery. The user said \"preferably\", meaning they would like Creek but it's not a hard requirement. However, the function doesn't have a way to indicate a preference without making it a requirement. Since the function requires the brewery, we have to set it. We set it to \"Creek brewery\". If the function can't find a beer from that brewery, it might return nothing? But that's the function's behavior. We are following the user's request.\n\n Alternatively, we could call the function without the brewery and then filter? But the function requires brewery. So we must set it.\n\n Therefore, we proceed with the above.\n\n However, note: the function's brewery parameter description says: \"The brewery name to find similar beers.\" So it might be that it uses the brewery to find beers from that brewery. We are setting it to \"Creek brewery\".\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}

We can represent 133 and 34 as floats (133.0 and 34.0) but the function also accepts integers because they can be converted to float.\n But the function parameter 'numbers_list' expects an array of floats, and integers are acceptable because they are numbers and will be converted to float in the array? Actually, in the function implementation, it would handle integers as well because they are a subset of floats. However, the type specified in the function parameter is float. We can pass integers as they are and the function should handle them.\n\n Let's create the function call accordingly.\n We will call the function 'sum_numbers' with a parameter named 'numbers_list' which is an array containing 133 and 34.\n\n The XML format should be:\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n     <params>\n       <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133, 34]\" type=\"array\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n However, note that the type of the array elements is float. But we are passing integers. This is acceptable because integers can be represented as floats. Alternatively, we can write them as floats: [133.0, 34.0]. But the function should handle both.\n\n But note: the value attribute must be a string representation of the array? Actually, in the XML representation, we have to represent the array as a string? How do we represent an array in the value?\n\n The instructions say: the type fields of the parameters must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n So for the parameter 'numbers_list', we set type=\"array\". But how to represent the array value?\n\n We can represent it as a string that is a valid JSON array? Or as a string that can be evaluated? Actually, the system expects the value to be provided in a way that can be parsed. Since we are using XML, we cannot directly put an array. We have to represent it as a string that can be parsed.\n\n Let me check the example: the example in the instructions uses a string for the value? For example, for a string parameter: value=\"hello\", type=\"string\". For an array, we have to represent it as a string that can be parsed to an array.\n\n We can use a JSON string representation.\n\n So: value='[133, 34]' and type=\"array\"\n\n But note: the function expects an array of floats. We are passing integers. This is acceptable because the function can convert integers to floats.\n\n Alternatively, we can write: value='[133.0, 34.0]' but it's the same.\n\n However, the function does not require the array to be of integers? It says the array items are of type float. So we can pass integers because they are a subset of floats? Actually, in the function, we are going to sum them, and integers are numbers.\n\n But the function parameter is defined as an array of floats. So we can pass integers and they will be converted to floats? Yes.\n\n So the function call will be:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n     <params>\n       <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133, 34]\" type=\"array\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n However, note: the type of the parameter is array, but the array itself has a specific element type (float). The system that processes the function call will parse the string as an array and then check the element types? Or it will convert the array elements to the required type? That's an implementation detail. We are following the specification by providing an array of numbers (which are integers, but they are numbers and can be represented as floats).\n\n Alternatively, we can also note that the function is implemented in Python and the function would work with integers as well.\n\n Let me write the function call accordingly.\n\n Important: The value must be a string that represents the array. So we write the array in JSON format.\n\n We'll write: value=\"[133, 34]\"\n\n But note: if we write it without quotes inside the string, it will be parsed as an array of two integers. Then the function will convert them to float when adding? Or the function expects floats? The function description says: \"a list of floating-point numbers\". So we are providing integers, which are not floating-point? But they are whole numbers and can be exactly represented as floats.\n\n So it's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can write them as floats: value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\"\n\n But either way is acceptable.\n\n I choose to write as integers because the input was integers.\n\n So the function call:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n     <params>\n       <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133, 34]\" type=\"array\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n But wait: the type of the parameter is array, but the value is a string? How does the system know that the string represents an array? Because we set type=\"array\", so the system will parse the string as an array.\n\n However, note that the value attribute is always a string. So for an array, we must provide a string that can be parsed to an array. We are using a JSON array representation.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133, 34]\" type=\"array\"/>\n\n But note: the array must be of floats. The function expects an array of floats. We are passing an array of integers. The system that runs the function might convert them to float? Or the function might do that? The function in Python might be:\n\n def sum_numbers(numbers_list: list[float]) -> float:\n     return sum(numbers_list)\n\n This function would work with integers because they are a subtype of float? Actually, in Python, integers are not a subtype of float, but they are numeric and can be added. Also, the function would convert them to float? Actually, the function doesn't explicitly convert, but the addition of integers and floats would result in a float? However, the function is defined to take a list of floats, but we can pass a list of integers and it would work because of duck typing? But the type annotation is for documentation and static checking. At runtime, it will work.\n\n Since the function is designed to sum numbers, it will work.\n\n Alternatively, to be safe, we can write the numbers as floats in the array: [133.0, 34.0]. But that is not necessary.\n\n I think the function will handle integers.\n\n So we proceed.\n\n However, note: the function parameter is described as \"A list of floating-point numbers\". We are passing integers. The function might break? Let's assume the function is implemented to handle any numeric type. The function description doesn't say it breaks with integers.\n\n Given that the function is for summing, it's safe.\n\n Therefore, the function call is as above.\n\n But wait: what if the system that parses the XML expects the array to be represented in a specific way? We are using a JSON string. That should be acceptable.\n\n So the final function call:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133, 34]\" type=\"array\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>"}

The example given is: 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n     We need to replace {ip} with the given IP and also note the version? The example does not include the version in the URL.\n\n But the user provided version: 6.3.1. We must check if the version is part of the URL.\n\n Looking at the function's description for the URL: it says \"e.g., 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\"\n The version is not explicitly in the example. However, in practice, the version might be part of the base path. But the user did not specify the exact endpoint.\n\n Since the problem states: \"Version: 6.3.1\", we must consider that the endpoint might be versioned. However, the example URL does not have the version in the path.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we stick to the example provided in the function. We assume the base URL is as provided, but we must insert the IP.\n\n So the URL will be: `https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo`\n\n Alternatively, note that the example has two \"api\" in the path: .../api/api/...

The function says required: ['url', 'params'] and the properties of params are defined. We have all the parameters the user provided, and they are all required by the user's request, but note the function does not require every property in the params? The function's required for the overall call are url and params. The params itself is a dict and we are providing all the properties that we have and that are defined in the function's params properties.\n\n However, note that the function's parameters for `params` are defined with properties: fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, infoType. And the user provided all of these. So we include them.\n\n But note: the function does not mark which of the params properties are required? The function's parameters for the tool are defined as:\n   - required: ['url', 'params'] for the top-level.\n   - for `params`, it is a dict and we are providing the properties that we have. The function does not specify which of the properties of `params` are required? The description says: \"The query parameters for the request.\" and then lists properties. But the user provided all of them.\n\n We assume we can pass all the provided parameters.\n\n We'll construct the function call accordingly.\n\n One more note: the `nodeId` and `podId` are integers, so we set their type accordingly.\n\n The function call in the required XML format:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"requests.get\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\">\n        <!-- How to represent a dict? The specification says the type can be dict, but then we have to represent the value? \n        However, note the format: we are to use the XML format as shown. But the example only shows simple parameters.\n\n        The problem says: \n          <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n        But for a dict, we cannot put the value in a string? \n\n        Actually, the specification does not explicitly show how to represent a dict. However, looking at the example in the problem statement, it only shows simple parameters.\n\n        But note: the tool expects the `params` argument to be a dictionary. We must represent it as a dict in the value? But the value attribute is for a string.\n\n        This is a limitation of the format. We must represent the entire dict as a string? But that would be error-prone.\n\n        Alternatively, we might break the dict into multiple parameters? But that is not the structure.\n\n        However, the problem states: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n        So we can set type=\"dict\", but then how to represent the value? The value must be a string representation? \n\n        We can represent the dict as a JSON string? But note: the function is in Python, so the tool that interprets this might expect a JSON string that can be parsed to a dict.\n\n        But the problem does not specify. We have to assume that the value of a dict parameter is a string that is a JSON representation.\n\n        However, the example in the problem does not show a dict. We must follow the specification: we are to output in the format:\n\n        <param name=\"params\" value=\"...\", type=\"dict\"/>\n\n        But what is the value? We cannot put a JSON string? \n\n        Alternatively, the tool might expect that for a dict we use nested elements? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we note that the tool we are using (as per the example) expects a dict. We will represent the dict as a JSON string and hope the system can parse it.\n\n        But the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and the format is fixed.\n\n        Another idea: the problem says the type can be dict, so we represent the value as a string that is a JSON object.\n\n        Example: \n          value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'\n\n        This is a string, but we set type=\"dict\". Then the interpreter on the other side should parse this string to a dict.\n\n        This is a common practice.\n\n        So we do:\n\n        <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n\n        But note: the value must be escaped? In XML, we have to escape quotes. Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the value attribute and then double quotes inside? Or vice versa.\n\n        We are writing XML, so we can do:\n\n          <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n\n        This uses single quotes for the attribute and double for the JSON.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify how to represent complex types. We assume this is acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we might break the dict into multiple parameters? But the function expects a single `params` argument of type dict.\n\n        We'll go with the JSON string representation.\n\n        But note: the problem says the function is in Python 3 syntax. In Python, we would pass a dict. But in the XML, we have to represent it as a string.\n\n        So we do:\n\n          <param name=\"params\" value=\"{'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'}\" type=\"dict\"/>\n\n        But this uses single quotes and is not JSON. And the value is a string that is a Python dict? The tool on the other side might use `eval`? That would be unsafe.\n\n        Alternatively, we use JSON which is more standard.\n\n        We decide to use JSON.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n          value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'\n\n        But note: the value is inside an XML attribute, so we must escape special characters. However, in this case, we don't have any special XML characters except the double quotes. We can use single quotes for the XML attribute and then double quotes for the JSON.\n\n        Alternatively, we can escape the double quotes in the JSON string? But that would be messy.\n\n        Since the XML attribute can be delimited by single quotes, we do:\n\n          <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n\n        This should be acceptable.\n\n        However, note the problem says: \"The type fields of the parameters ...\". We set type=\"dict\", and the value is a string that represents a dict in JSON.\n\n        We hope the system will parse it.\n\n        Alternatively, the tool might be designed to handle this representation.\n\n        Let's proceed.\n\n    -->\n      </param>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nBut note: the above structure is not valid because we have a <params> tag and then a <param> for url and a <param> for params. We must have each parameter as a separate <param> inside <params>.\n\nThe structure should be:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"requests.get\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nBut wait, the function expects two parameters: `url` and `params`. We are providing two <param> elements.\n\nHowever, note that the `params` parameter is of type dict and we are representing it as a string in JSON format, but we set type=\"dict\". The system must know to parse the JSON string to a dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent the dict as a nested structure? The problem does not specify. We stick to the above.\n\nBut note: the problem example does not show nested parameters. So we use the JSON string.\n\nAnother issue: the example URL has two consecutive 'api' in the path: .../api/api/... Is that correct? The user did not specify the exact endpoint. We are following the example in the function description.\n\nWe'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, the final function call:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"requests.get\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nNote: We converted interfaceType to lowercase 'ethernet' to match the enum.\n\nBut wait, the enum in the function includes 'ethernet', so we are safe.\n\nWe are done."}

We must pass the command exactly as provided.\n\n But note: the command includes double quotes. We need to make sure that the string is properly escaped or passed as is.\n\n Since the function call will be in XML, we have to escape the double quotes inside the attribute value.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the XML attribute value and then use double quotes inside without escaping? \n But the specification says: the value in the param tag is given as an attribute, so we have to use XML escaping.\n\n However, the problem is that the command contains double quotes. We can either:\n   - Use double quotes for the XML attribute and escape the inner double quotes as &quot;\n   - Or use single quotes for the XML attribute and then we can have double quotes inside without escaping.\n\n But the format requires the value to be in double quotes? Actually, in XML, attributes can be in either single or double quotes.\n\n However, the example format uses double quotes for the attribute. But note that the example also has nested tags.\n\n But in our case, the function call will look like:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"cmd_controller.execute\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"command\" value=\"tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the value? The specification does not specify, but to be safe and consistent with the example, we'll use double quotes for the XML attribute and escape the inner double quotes.\n\n So we replace the double quotes inside the command string with &quot;.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function expects a string. We can write the command as: \n   command: \"tasklist /FI \\\"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\\\"\"\n\n But in XML, we are inside an attribute value that is already in double quotes, so we must escape the inner double quotes as &quot;.\n\n Therefore, the value for the command parameter will be: \n   value=\"tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;\"\n\n But note: the command is exactly as the user provided? Actually, the user provided: `tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"`\n We are representing the double quotes around the filter as &quot; in the XML attribute.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid escaping by using single quotes for the outer XML attribute? But the example uses double quotes.\n\n Let me look at the format: \n   <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n So the value is in double quotes. Therefore, we must escape any double quote inside.\n\n So we write: \n   value=\"tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;\"\n\n But note: the command also has a space and equals sign, which are fine.\n\n Alternatively, we could also use single quotes for the inner string in the command? But the command is for Windows command line, and it requires double quotes.\n\n Actually, in the Windows command line, the filter must be in double quotes. So we must preserve them.\n\n Therefore, we escape the inner double quotes as &quot;.\n\n Let's build the function call:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"cmd_controller.execute\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"command\" value=\"tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n However, note: the function is designed for Windows, and the command is a Windows command. This should work.\n\n But what if we want to capture the output? The function `cmd_controller.execute` as described uses `os.system()`, which returns the exit code, but the output goes to the console. However, the user's question is about whether VS Code is running, so we would need to interpret the output.\n\n However, the function we have only returns the exit code. The exit code of `tasklist` is 0 if it found processes, and non-zero if it didn't? Actually, the `tasklist` command returns 0 even if it found no processes? Let me recall:\n\n According to the documentation for `tasklist`:\n   - It returns 0 on success and non-zero on failure. But success just means the command ran, not that it found processes.\n\n So we cannot rely on the exit code to know if VS Code is running. We would need to parse the output.\n\n But note: the function we have only executes the command and returns the exit code. It does not capture the output. Therefore, we cannot use this function to answer the question as posed? Because the user wants to know \"is VS Code running\", and we have no way to get the output.\n\n However, the function description says: \"Executes a given command using the os.system() function\". And `os.system()` returns the exit code of the command. So we cannot get the output.\n\n Therefore, we must point out that the provided function is insufficient? But wait, the user is asking to use the command `tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\"`. They are not asking for a function that captures output. They are just asking to run that command.\n\n But the purpose is to check if VS Code is running. Without the output, we can't know.\n\n Alternatively, we can run the command and then look at the output? But the function doesn't return the output.\n\n Therefore, we must note that the current function set does not provide a way to capture the output of the command. We can only run it and get the exit code.\n\n However, the `tasklist` command does not set a non-zero exit code when no processes are found? Let me check:\n\n In reality, `tasklist` returns:\n   - 0: successful execution, and it may or may not have found matching processes.\n   - 1: incorrect parameter\n   - 128: system did not support the request\n\n So we cannot use the exit code to determine if there are any matching processes.\n\n Given the constraints, we can only run the command and the output will be printed to the console, but we cannot capture it in the function. Therefore, the user might see the output, but our function call cannot return the result.\n\n However, the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and if none of the functions can be used, point it out.\n\n But note: the user explicitly said \"using the command tasklist /FI ...\", so they are asking to run that command. Even if we cannot capture the output, we can run it and the user might see the output.\n\n Since the user asked to use that specific command, we will run it.\n\n Alternatively, we might be in a system where the output of the function is captured and shown to the user? The problem doesn't specify. But the function we have doesn't capture the output.\n\n But the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" However, we can use the function to run the command, so we can use it.\n\n Therefore, we will call the function with the given command.\n\n However, note: the function is designed for Windows, and the command is a Windows command. So it is appropriate.\n\n We'll generate the function call as described.\n\n But note: the command is case-insensitive? The tasklist filter \"IMAGENAME eq Code.exe\" might be. But the actual process might be \"code.exe\" (lowercase). The tasklist filter is case-insensitive? Actually, in Windows, process names are case-insensitive. But let's stick to the user's input.\n\n The user wrote \"Code.exe\", so we use that.\n\n Therefore, the function call:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"cmd_controller.execute\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"command\" value=\"tasklist /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq Code.exe&quot;\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n But wait, what if there are multiple words? Actually, the command is a single string. We are passing it exactly.\n\n However, note that the command might run and we get the output on the console. The user will then see the list of processes or a message that no tasks are running.\n\n But the function call does not return the output, so we cannot use the result to answer the question programmatically. However, the user did not ask for a programmatic answer? They just asked to run that command.\n\n Since the user specifically provided the command, we assume they want it to be executed.\n\n Let's generate the function call accordingly."}
