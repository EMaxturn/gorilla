The data_loading function can do that. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The file is 'dataset.csv', so file_path is 'dataset.csv'. The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which should be fine here.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. But wait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as arrays. So after loading, I should assign x = data['sales'] and y = data['future_sales'].\n\nThen, call linear_regression_fit with those x and y, and set return_residuals to True. The function's parameters include return_residuals as an optional boolean, defaulting to false. The user wants residuals, so that flag must be set to true.\n\nWait, but the data_loading function's output is a data structure. The user's code would need to handle that. But according to the functions provided, the data_loading function is supposed to load the data, and then the user would access the columns. So the function calls here are data_loading first, then linear_regression_fit with the extracted columns.\n\nSo the steps are: call data_loading with file_path 'dataset.csv', then use the returned data to get x and y, then fit the model with return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the function calls, how to represent the data extraction? The parameters for linear_regression_fit are x and y as arrays. So the user would have to pass those arrays. But the assistant can't process the data, just call the functions. So the correct sequence is first load the data, then pass the columns to the regression function.\n\nTherefore, the function calls should be first data_loading, then linear_regression_fit with x and y from the loaded data. The user would need to handle the data extraction in their code, but according to the problem, the assistant just needs to generate the function calls with the parameters as specified.\n\nSo the first function call is data_loading with file_path 'dataset.csv'. The second is linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], return_residuals=True."}

The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures. The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it's about retrieving the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nFor the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. But the size parameter expects an array of integers. So I need to convert 4 ft x 4 ft into an array, maybe [4, 4]. Similarly, the second sculpture is in New York, bronze, 6x3 ft, so size [6, 3].\n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for sculpture_size are an array of integers. The user provided the dimensions as \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to parse those into numerical values. Assuming that the size is in feet, so the array would be [4,4] and [6,3]. \n\nHowever, the get_artwork_price function might calculate the price based on these dimensions and material. But the user is asking for the average price of both. So I need to call the function for each sculpture and then average the results. \n\nBut the problem is, the functions available don't have a way to calculate an average. The get_artwork_price function would return the price for each individual sculpture. So I need to call it twice, once for each sculpture, and then compute the average manually. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the average of the two prices. So first, I need to get the price of each sculpture using get_artwork_price, then average them. However, the functions provided don't have an average function. So the assistant would have to make two separate calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture and then compute the average. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Call get_artwork_price for the first sculpture: museum_location=Philadelphia, sculpture_material=marble, sculpture_size=[4,4].\n2. Call get_artwork_price for the second sculpture: museum_location=New York, sculpture_material=bronze, sculpture_size=[6,3].\n3. Once both prices are retrieved, calculate the average.\n\nBut the assistant can only make function calls. Since the user is asking for the average, but the functions don't handle averaging, the assistant would need to make both calls and then the system would handle the average. However, the assistant's role is to make the necessary function calls. So the answer would be two function calls, each for the respective sculpture. The average would be computed after getting both prices."}

The user has three parts to solve.\n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The function calc_energy seems right here. The parameters required are mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The substance is glucose, which is C6H12O6. The default joules_per_mol is 2800, which matches the given value, so I can use that. So, mols is 5, substance is \"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol is 2800. That should give the total energy.\n\nSecond, using that energy, calculate the biomass with the conversion efficiency of 10%. The calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. The efficiency is 0.1 here. So once I have the energy from the first step, I can plug it into this function.\n\nThird, calculate the work done by the machine. The calc_work function needs energy and distance. The distance is 2 meters. But wait, the energy here is the same as the total energy from the first step? The problem says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria\", so yes. So the parameters would be energy (from step 1) and distance 2.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called in order.

The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So principle is 5000, duration 5, annual rate 4. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually for 5 years. The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. Parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1.

The function here is future_value. The parameters required are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The interest rate is 5%, so 0.05 as a decimal. Time is 6 years, num_compoundings is 2. The future_value function's parameters include num_compoundings with a default of 1, so we need to specify 2 here.\n\nWait, let me check the parameters again.
