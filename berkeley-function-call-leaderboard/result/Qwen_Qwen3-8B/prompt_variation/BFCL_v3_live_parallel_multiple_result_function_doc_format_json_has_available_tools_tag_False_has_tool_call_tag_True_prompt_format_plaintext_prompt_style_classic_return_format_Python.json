First, they want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. Looking at the available functions, there's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the food item. They mentioned removing anchovies, so I should set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they didn't specify any, maybe it's not needed. So the first function call would be ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences should include size=\"large\", temperature=\"hot\", sweetness_level=\"regular\", and milk_type=\"almond\". The special_instructions aren't mentioned, so that can be omitted. So the second function call is ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences as the specified parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory might be the same as the repo name. Let's assume the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'. So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'. This will determine the main programming language, which is probably JavaScript/Node.js.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory. So call that function with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nNext, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. The same directory applies here. The parameters for Kubernetes include deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. The image name might be based on the repo name, but the default is 'latest'. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' and default parameters.\n\nAfter creating these files, the user wants to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, etc. The default branch is 'main', and commit message is 'Update changes'. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The function push_git_changes_to_github automatically git adds changes, so that's covered. \n\nI need to make sure all functions are called in order. Let me check parameters again. The clone_repo's destination is default, so no need to specify. The analyse_repo_contents needs the directory name, which is the cloned repo's directory. The Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs also use the same directory. Then push changes. \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the function calls accordingly."}

They need two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to find classes related to 'CellResult'. The function get_relevant_classes is suitable here. The parameters required are search_string, which should be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories set to true as per the user's request.

The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. However, the parameters needed are class_name and method_name. Since the user mentioned 'AbstractCellHandler', I'll use that as the class_name. For each method, I'll make a separate call. So, two calls to get_signature: one for 'setCellValue' and another for 'getCellValue', both with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the methods they're overriding in 'AbstractCellHandler' are expecting 'CellResult' to have 'getNumericValue()', which isn't present. But the user's main request is to find related classes and method signatures. So, the functions to call are get_relevant_classes for 'CellResult' with include_subdirectories true, and two get_signature calls for the methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nI should check if the parameters are correctly provided.

That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned \"Queenstown Singapore,\" but I should check if that's a valid location. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user might be referring to Queenstown in Singapore? Or maybe it's a typo. However, I should take the user's input as given. The location parameter can be in the format \"City, Country\" or \"City, State (abbr)\". So, \"Queenstown, Singapore\" would fit as \"City, Country\". The unit is optional with a default of fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify, so I'll use the default.\n\nWait, but does Singapore have a state abbreviation? Singapore is a country, so the format \"Queenstown, Singapore\" should work.
