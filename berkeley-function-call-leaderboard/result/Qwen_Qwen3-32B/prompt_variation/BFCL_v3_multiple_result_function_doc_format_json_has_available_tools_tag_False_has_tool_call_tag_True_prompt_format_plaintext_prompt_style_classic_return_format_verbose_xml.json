It requires initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2. Since the user didn't specify rounding, I can use the default. So I should call the calculate_displacement function with those values. The parameters are all integers except maybe time, but 5 is an integer. So the function call should include initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No need to include rounding since it's optional. That should give the displacement."}

The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States.

The function requires game_title and platform, which are provided. So the correct call would be store_price with all three parameters. I don't need to check if it's on sale separately because the user is asking for the selling price, which might already include any sales.

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem mentions constant acceleration, so maybe I can use kinematic equations. The user provided two functions: calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nLooking at the functions, calculate_speed_from_rest requires distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). The parameters here are distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial_speed=0. That fits perfectly. The function should compute the final speed using the formula v = u + at, but since u is 0, it's v = at. But how does the function get acceleration? Wait, maybe the function uses another formula that relates distance, time, and acceleration. Oh right, the formula for distance under constant acceleration from rest is s = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2. Then acceleration a = 2s / t\u00b2. Once we have a, multiply by t to get final velocity v = a*t. So combining those steps, v = (2s/t\u00b2)*t = 2s/t. Let me check with s=20, t=4: 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. \n\nBut the function calculate_speed_from_rest might handle this. Let me check its parameters: it needs distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). So passing distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0 should work. The function's implementation would use the correct kinematic equation. Therefore, the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when two moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with three moles of the same gas at 400 K. Hmm, I remember that when gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the number of moles.\n\nThe formula I think is (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. So plugging in the values: (2*300 + 3*400) / (2+3). That gives (600 + 1200)/5 = 1800/5 = 360 K. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The parameters required are all present here: 2, 300, 3, 400. So I should call that function with these values. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed here because the problem doesn't involve molar mass. Yep, that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss any parameters. All required ones are there.
