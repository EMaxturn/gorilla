Since initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, I don't need to include it unless it's different. But the user did mention it's zero, so maybe it's better to include it explicitly for clarity. Wait, the function's parameters have initial_velocity with a default, so even if the user says zero, it's the same as not including it. But including it might make the parameters clear.\n\nGravity isn't mentioned, so I should use the default 9.81. So the function call would need height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity is default. So the tool call would be calculate_final_velocity with those parameters. Let me check the function's args again. The function's args are height (int), initial_velocity (int, default 0), gravity (float, default 9.81). So the user provided height=150, initial_velocity=0.

Let me look at its parameters. The args are company, start_date, location, and status. The status has a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe user specified 'ongoing' status, so I can include that. The company is Google. The start_date is after January 1, 2021. Wait, the function's start_date parameter expects a date in MM-DD-YYY format. The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021? But the function might accept a date range, but the parameter is a single start date. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and end date, but the description says \"date range\" but the args only have start_date. Wait, looking back: the function's description says \"within a specific date range\" but the args only have start_date. That might be an inconsistency. Wait, the function's args are start_date (str) and location. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and end date, but the parameters only have start_date? Or maybe the end date is not part of the parameters? Wait, the function's parameters are company, start_date, location, status. So maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not specified? Or perhaps the user is supposed to input the start date as the beginning of the range, and the end date is not part of the parameters. But the user's query says \"filed after January 1, 2021\", which implies a start date of January 1, 2021. But the function's start_date is the start of the date range. So maybe the user wants lawsuits filed on or after January 1, 2021. So the start_date should be \"01-01-2021\". But the user said \"after\", so maybe \"01-02-2021\"? But the function's parameter is a string in MM-DD-YYY format. So the user's query says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 1, 2021, but the function might require that. Alternatively, maybe the function's start_date is the earliest date, so if the user wants after that date, the start_date would be January 1, 2021. But I need to check the function's parameters. The function's description says \"within a specific date range and location\". Wait, but the parameters only have start_date. Maybe the function is designed to take a start date and end date, but the parameters are only start_date? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not part of the parameters. But the user's query is about lawsuits filed after a certain date. So perhaps the start_date is set to January 1, 2021, and the function will return lawsuits filed on or after that date. Alternatively, maybe the function's start_date is the earliest date, and the user's query is \"after\" which would mean start_date is January 1, 2021. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the parameters would be company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', status='ongoing'. The status is optional, but the user specified ongoing, so include it. The function's default for status is 'ongoing', but since the user explicitly says ongoing, it's better to include it.\n\nSo the function call would be lawsuit_search(company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', status='ongoing')."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the find_recipe function that takes recipeName and maxCalories. The default for maxCalories is 1000, but the user specified less than 500, so I need to set maxCalories=500. The recipeName is \"pasta carbonara\". So I should call find_recipe with those parameters. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly named and valued. Let me double-check the function's args: recipeName is a string, maxCalories is an integer. Yep, that's all. No missing parameters here."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York, for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function provided is hotel_booking. Let me look at its parameters: location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences.\n\nThe user specified \"near Manhattan, New York\" as the location. So location should be \"Manhattan, New York\". The room type is \"single\". The duration is 3 nights. The start date is March 10th, 2023. The preferences include pet-friendly. \n\nThe preferences parameter is a list, so I need to include \"pet-friendly\" in that list. The function's preferences are optional, so if not specified, it uses all, but here we need to specify it. \n\nWait, the function's parameters: location is a string, room_type is a string, duration is an integer, start_date is a string (probably in date format), and preferences is a list. \n\nSo putting it all together: location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is \"single\", duration is 3, start_date is \"2023-03-10\" (assuming the format is YYYY-MM-DD), and preferences is [\"pet-friendly\"]. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required parameters are location, room_type, duration, start_date. The user provided all of these. The preferences are optional but specified here. \n\nSo the function call should be hotel_booking with those parameters. Let me check again. The user said \"near Manhattan\", but the function's location parameter is a string. Maybe \"near Manhattan, New York\" is acceptable, but perhaps the function expects just the city. But the user specified \"near Manhattan, New York\", so I should include that as the location. \n\nYes, so the parameters are correct. The start date is March 10th, 2023. So the date should be \"2023-03-10\". \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is hotel_booking with location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"2023-03-10\", preferences=[\"pet-friendly\"]."}
