The user wants to log their food intake. They mentioned two instances: first, 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea. Earlier, they had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\n\nI need to use the log_food function for each item. The function requires food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type (default is snack), and log_date. The user didn't specify the date and time, so maybe I should note that. But since the function requires log_date, I might have to make an assumption or use the current date. Wait, the user mentioned \"earlier\" and \"now,\" so maybe they want separate log dates. But without specific times, perhaps the current date and time can be used, but the user hasn't provided that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the function's log_date is required.
