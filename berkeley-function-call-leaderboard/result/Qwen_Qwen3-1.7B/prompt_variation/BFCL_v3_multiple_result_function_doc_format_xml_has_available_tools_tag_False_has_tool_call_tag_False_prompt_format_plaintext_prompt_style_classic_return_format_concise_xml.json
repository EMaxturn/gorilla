The parameters are all required except rounding. The user didn't specify rounding, so maybe I can leave it out or set it to 2 decimals. But the function allows it as optional. So I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. The rounding parameter is optional, so I can omit it. Let me check the parameters again. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, time are required, and rounding is optional. So the function call should be kinematics.calculate_displacement with those three parameters. I don't need to include rounding unless specified. So the function call is correct."}

There's video_games.on_sale, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which fetches the selling price. The question is about the cheapest price, so store_price might be the right one. But wait, the user wants the cheapest price, not just the current price. However, the functions provided don't mention anything about finding the cheapest price. They just fetch the current price. So maybe the user is assuming that the store_price gives the cheapest price, but that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe the store_price function returns the price at which the game is sold, which could be the cheapest. But I need to check the function's description. The store_price function says it fetches the selling price, which is the price at which the game is sold. If the game is on sale, the price might be lower. But the user is asking for the cheapest price, so perhaps the store_price function would give the current price, which is the cheapest. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a function to find the lowest price, but that's not listed here. Since the available functions don't have a way to find the cheapest price, but only the current price, I should use store_price. So the parameters would be game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', region 'United States'. Then, the function call would be video_games.store_price with those parameters. The user might not know that the store_price gives the current price, which is the cheapest, but according to the function's description, it's the selling price. So I'll proceed with that."}

The user is asking to find out the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about finding the final speed.\n\nThe formula that relates distance, initial speed, final speed, and time is: \ndistance = initial_speed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. \n\nBut since the initial speed is 0, it simplifies to distance = 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. Solving for acceleration would give acceleration = 2 * distance / time\u00b2. Then, using the formula for final speed, v = u + at, where u is initial speed (0), so v = a * t. \n\nBut the user wants the final speed, not the acceleration. So maybe they need to calculate the acceleration first and then use that to find the speed. However, the problem is that the user might not need the acceleration directly. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions provided: there's kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The parameters are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function's description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration over distance. So if I call this function with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0, it should return the final speed.\n\nWait, but the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest require distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). The user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial_speed=0. So the function should accept those parameters. The function's required parameters are distance and time, which are provided. The initial_speed is optional, but since it's 0, including it might be better for clarity.\n\nSo the correct function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That should give the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, might not be necessary here because the user is asking for speed, not acceleration. So the answer is to call calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

The formula is T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2). \n\nSo the parameters needed are the quantities of each gas and their respective temperatures.

The required parameters are desired_sum, sides_per_die, and n_rolls. The desired_sum is 7, which is given. The sides_per_die is usually 6 for a standard die, so that's default. The n_rolls is 2 because they're rolling two dice. Wait, the function's parameters: n_rolls is optional and defaults to 1. So even if they roll two dice, the function should handle that.

Wait, the function's parameters: the desired_sum is required, sides_per_die is required, and n_rolls is optional. So I need to include desired_sum=7, sides_per_die=6, and n_rolls=2.
