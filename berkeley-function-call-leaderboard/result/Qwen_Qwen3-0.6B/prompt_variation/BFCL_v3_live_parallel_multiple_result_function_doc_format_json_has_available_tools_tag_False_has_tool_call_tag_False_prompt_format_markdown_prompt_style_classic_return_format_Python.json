There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for changing drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I'll set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The newIngredients should be \"Caesar salad\". The specialInstructions might be \"without anchovies\" as per the request. So, I need to call ChaFod with these parameters.\n\nNext, for the drink order 123, the user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id, new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The preferences include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", and milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions might be \"no salt\" if needed, but the user didn't mention it, so maybe leave it empty. So, call ChaDri.change_drink with these parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The foodItem is required, and the drink_id is also required. The other parameters are optional but necessary for the function. So, both function calls should be made."}

The get_relevant_classes function seems relevant for finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to True.

The include_private parameter should be set to True to include private methods' signatures.\n\nWait, but the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so maybe the get_relevant_classes function would find 'CellResult' and include subdirectories.
