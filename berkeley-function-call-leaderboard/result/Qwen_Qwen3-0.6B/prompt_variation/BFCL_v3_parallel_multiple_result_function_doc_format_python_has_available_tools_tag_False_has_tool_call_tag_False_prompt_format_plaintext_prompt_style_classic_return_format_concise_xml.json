The get_projection takes the same parameters but with years for prediction.\n\nSo for Bangladesh and India, I need to call get_history twice.

Then for Nepal and Malaysia, use get_projection with species 'tiger', countries, and years 10. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"last 5 years\" and \"next 10 years\". So each query is separate. I need to make two get_history calls for the first part and two get_projection calls for the second part. \n\nI should structure the function calls accordingly. Each function call is in the required format. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly specified. The years are integers, so that's fine.

The user wants to fit a linear regression model to predict future sales based on current sales data. They provided the dataset.csv file. The functions available are linear_regression_fit and data_loading.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data. The data_loading function requires a file path and a delimiter. The user mentioned the dataset.csv file, so the file_path should be 'dataset.csv'. The delimiter is not specified, but maybe it's a comma, which is common. So I'll call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv' and delimiter=','.\n\nNext, the user wants to use x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']. Wait, but the data_loading function returns the data structure, so I need to check if the data has those columns. Assuming that the dataset has columns 'sales' and 'future_sales', I can extract those. But the data_loading function's parameters don't mention extracting columns, so maybe I need to process the data after loading. However, the user's instruction says to use the data from the dataset, so perhaps the data is already in the structure. So I can proceed to call linear_regression_fit with x and y as those columns.\n\nWait, but the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as lists. So I need to make sure that the data is in the correct format. The user's data is in the dataset, so after loading, x would be the 'sales' column and y the 'future_sales' column. So the function calls would be data_loading and then linear_regression_fit with those parameters.\n\nBut the user also wants to calculate and return the residuals. The return_residuals parameter is optional, defaulting to 'false'. So in the function call, I can set return_residuals to 'true' if needed. But the user says to return the residuals, so maybe set it to true. However, the default is false, so maybe it's better to explicitly set it. But the problem is that the function's default is 'false', so if the user wants to return residuals, we need to include that.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are: load the data, then fit the model with x and y as the columns.

There's get_sculpture_details which gets details like material and size from a museum. The get_artwork_price function retrieves the price based on size and material. \n\nThe user wants the average price, so I need to call both functions for each sculpture. For the first sculpture, the museum_location is the Museum of Philadelphia, and the material is marble, size is a list [4,4]. For the second, museum_location is New York, material bronze, size [6,3]. \n\nWait, but the get_sculpture_details function requires the sculpture_id, but the user didn't mention an ID. The get_artwork_price function requires the sculpture_material and size. So maybe I need to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture. But the user didn't provide the IDs, so maybe those functions can't be used without the IDs. However, the problem is that the user's question doesn't specify the IDs, so perhaps those functions can't be used. But the available functions don't have parameters for sculpture_id. \n\nWait, the get_sculpture_details function's parameters are museum_location and sculpture_id. The get_artwork_price function's parameters are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. Since the user didn't provide the IDs, maybe those functions can't be used. But the user's question is about the average price, so perhaps I need to call both functions and then average the results. But without knowing the actual prices, how can I do that? \n\nWait, maybe the functions can be used even without IDs. For example, get_sculpture_details might return the material and size, and get_artwork_price might return the price. But the user's question is about the average price, so maybe I need to call both functions once each and then compute the average. But since the user hasn't provided the actual prices, perhaps the functions can't be used without the necessary parameters. \n\nWait, the problem says that if the functions can't be used, point it out. But the user's question requires parameters that are not present in the functions. For example, the get_sculpture_details requires a sculpture_id, which isn't provided. The get_artwork_price requires a sculpture_material and size, which are provided. So maybe the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, even if the IDs are missing. But the user's question doesn't mention IDs, so perhaps that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the functions can be used with the parameters provided. Let me check again. The get_artwork_price function's parameters are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user provided the museum locations and materials, but not the sizes. Wait, the user's question says \"4 ft x 4 ft marble statue\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft bronze sculpture\". So the sizes are provided. So for the first sculpture, the size is [4,4], and for the second, [6,3]. \n\nSo the correct steps would be to call get_artwork_price once for each sculpture, using the provided parameters. Then, since the user wants the average, but the functions don't return the average, maybe the answer is that the functions can't be used without the necessary parameters. But the user's question does provide the necessary parameters. \n\nWait, but the functions don't have an average function. So perhaps the answer is that the functions can't be used to compute the average, but the user's question can be answered by calling both functions and then averaging the results. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual prices, maybe the correct response is to call the functions and then state that the average can't be determined without the prices. But the problem says to make function calls if possible. \n\nWait, the user's question is asking for the average price, so maybe the answer is to call both functions and then compute the average. But since the functions don't return the average, perhaps the answer is that the functions can't be used. But the user's question requires the parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_artwork_price function can be used to get the price, and the get_sculpture_details can get the material and size. Then, the average would be calculated based on those. But since the user hasn't provided the actual prices, perhaps the answer is that the functions can't be used. \n\nBut the user's question is asking for the average, so maybe the correct approach is to call both functions once each and then compute the average.

But the user's question can be answered by calling the functions. So the correct function calls would be to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture. \n\nSo the first call is get_artwork_price with museum_location \"Museum of Philadelphia\", sculpture_material \"marble\", and sculpture_size [4,4]. The second call is get_artwork_price with museum_location \"New York\", sculpture_material \"bronze\", and sculpture_size [6,3]. Then, the average is calculated from those two results. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the actual prices, maybe the answer is that the functions can't be used.

The energy from the first step is the total energy, and the efficiency is 10%. So, I need to use biological.calc_biomass with the energy value and efficiency. The default for biomass is 100%? Or maybe the function expects a specific value. The function's description says it calculates biomass from energy with efficiency. So, the formula would be biomass = energy * efficiency.

The user mentioned Manchester United, so I should use the player_stats function. The player_stats function requires player_name, team_name, and competition.

There's games.update.find, games.reviews.find, and games.price.find. \n\nFor the first part, the game is Call of Duty, platform is PlayStation, region is European. So I should call games.update.find with game='Call of Duty', platform='PlayStation', region='European'.\n\nNext, the current price on Xbox. The function games.price.find requires game and platform. So game='Call of Duty', platform='Xbox'.\n\nThen, the reviews for FIFA 21 from America. The function games.reviews.find needs game and region. Game is FIFA 21, region is 'American'.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The region in the price function is optional, defaulting to global, but the user specified European and American. So each function call should have the correct parameters. Let me structure the function calls accordingly."}

Each part has specific ingredients and calorie limits.\n\nFirst, for breakfast, they need eggs, milk, and bread. The calories should be under 300. So I should use the recipe_search function. The parameters needed are ingredients, calories, and meal. The meal here is breakfast, so I'll set meal to 'breakfast'.\n\nNext, lunch. They want a restaurant with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce. The dishes should not exceed 500 calories. The restaurant_search function requires ingredients, calories, and meal. The meal here is lunch, so I'll set meal to 'lunch'.\n\nThen, dinner. They want a recipe with beef, but replace it with tofu. The total calories should be under 600. The ingredient_replace function is the right one here. The original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and calories should be 600. So I'll call ingredient_replace with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's parameters again. The recipe_search needs ingredients, calories, and meal. The ingredient_replace needs original_ingredient, replacement_ingredient, and calories. The restaurant_search needs ingredients, calories, and meal. All the required parameters are provided by the user. So I can call each function once for each part."}

The get_scientist_for_discovery function requires a discovery argument. The user mentioned the theory of relativity, so I'll use that. Then, the get_shortest_driving_distance function needs origin and destination. The user specified New York and Los Angeles, so I'll call that. Next, the cell_biology.function_lookup function needs the molecule (ATP), organelle (mitochondria), and specific_function (true). The user wants the specific function, so I'll set specific_function to true. Finally, the instrument_price.get function needs brand, model, and finish. The user mentioned Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish, so I'll use those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly formatted. For the functions, I'll list each one with the required parameters. Let me check if all the parameters are present and correctly typed. Yes, everything looks good.

The user has two main tasks here. First, modifying the painting's attributes, then predicting the evolutionary rate of an African elephant, and finally calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker.\n\nStarting with the painting. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue. The user wants to change the size to 30x40 inches, medium to oil, and dominant color to red. So I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size should be in inches, so 30x40. Medium is oil, and dominant color is red. So the function call for modify_painting would be with those parameters.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The prediction.evolution function requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, model is Darwin. The default model is Darwin, so if not specified, it's already there. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The user wants the probability of a royal flush. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52 cards, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. So the function call here would be calculate_probability with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For the painting, the size is a string, medium as a string, dominant_color as a string. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years as an integer, model as a string. For the poker probability, total_outcomes is an integer, favorable is an integer, round_to is an integer. All parameters are correctly specified. No missing parameters here. So the three function calls should cover all parts."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The house has an area of 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. So I need to use the predict_house_price function. The parameters required are area, rooms, year, and location. All these are provided, so I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the default state is California, but the user specified San Francisco, maybe I should include the county as well. Wait, the function's county is the jurisdiction, so maybe the state is California by default. But the user mentioned San Francisco county, so I should include county as San Francisco. So the parameters would be entity: \"Mr. John Doe\", county: \"San Francisco\", state: \"California\".\n\nThen, the probability part. The lottery has total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places. So I'll call calculate_probability with total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The functions are all in the list, so I can call each one. Let me check if there are any missing parameters. The user didn't mention anything else, so all required parameters are covered. So the three function calls should be sufficient."}

The function get_collectables_in_season is the right choice here. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function is appropriate. The parameters are game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia, so I'll input those values.\n\nThird, the lawsuit details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function requires company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided all three, so I'll use those.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability for 10 trials with 3 successes and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function is needed. The parameters are number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided all three, so I'll use those.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the right parameters.
