The file path is dataset.csv, and the delimiter is comma by default. So I should call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv' and delimiter=','). That should load the data into a structure, probably a DataFrame.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], so I need to extract those columns from the loaded data. But wait, the function's parameters are x and y as lists.

The return_residuals parameter is a boolean, defaulting to false.

The other function, get_sculpture_details, might give details like material and size, but the user is asking for the price, so that's probably not needed here.\n\nSo, for the first sculpture in Philadelphia: the material is marble, size is 4ft x4ft. I need to call get_artwork_price with museum_location \"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material \"marble\", and sculpture_size [4,4]. Then for the second one in New York: museum_location \"New York\", sculpture_material \"bronze\", sculpture_size [6,3]. \n\nWait, the get_artwork_price function's parameters are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The sculpture_size is a list, which matches the user's input. So I need to make two separate function calls. The user wants the average price, so after getting both prices, I can compute the average. But the functions don't have a function to compute the average, so maybe the user expects the two prices to be calculated and then averaged. However, the functions provided don't include an average function. But the user's question is about the average price, so perhaps the answer is the sum of the two prices divided by two. But since the functions don't handle that, maybe the user expects the two prices to be retrieved and then the average is calculated manually. But according to the instructions, I need to call the functions and return the function calls.

John has three investment options, and I need to calculate the returns for each using the provided functions. Let me break down each option and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, the first option is a simple interest scheme with a principal of $5000, a duration of 5 years, and an annual rate of 4%. The calc_Simple_Interest function seems appropriate here. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I'll call that function with 5000, 5, and 4.\n\nNext, the second option is compound interest with the same principal of $5000, 5 years, and an annual rate of 3.5%, compounded annually. The calc_Compound_Interest function takes principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1. So I'll use that function with 5000, 5, 3.5, and 1.\n\nThird, the third option is an initial investment of $3000 at 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. Here, the principal is 3000, duration is 6, annual_rate is 5, and compound_freq is 2. So I need to call calc_Compound_Interest again with these parameters.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using future_value as well. But the question says to use calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively. So for each option, I need to use the correct function. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe future_value function calculates the future value, which is the same as the compound interest result. But the user wants to use the three functions. However, the third option's description mentions a different principal and time. So maybe the future_value function is for calculating the future value, but the user wants to use the three functions. Wait, the user says \"using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So each option should be calculated with the corresponding function.\n\nWait, the first option is simple interest, so calc_Simple_Interest. The second is compound interest, so calc_Compound_Interest. The third option is a different scenario, but the user says to use future_value. Wait, the third option's description says \"invest an initial amount of $3000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year.\" So that's a compound interest scenario, but the user wants to use future_value. But the future_value function is for calculating future value, which is the same as compound interest. However, the user might have intended to use the calc_Compound_Interest function for that third option. But the user says to use future_value. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, the user's question says: \"using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So each option should be calculated with the corresponding function. So the first option is simple interest (calc_Simple_Interest), the second is compound interest (calc_Compound_Interest), and the third is future value (future_value). But the third option's parameters are different. Let me check the parameters for future_value.\n\nThe future_value function has parameters: initial_investment, interest_rate, time, num_compoundings. So for the third option, initial_investment is 3000, interest_rate is 5% (so 0.05 as a decimal), time is 6, and num_compoundings is 2. So using future_value with those parameters would give the future value. But the user might have intended to use calc_Compound_Interest for that third option. However, the user specifically says to use future_value. So I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nSo the three options are:\n\n1. Simple interest: calc_Simple_Interest with 5000, 5, 4.\n2. Compound interest: calc_Compound_Interest with 5000, 5, 3.5, 1.\n3. Future value: future_value with 3000, 0.05, 6, 2.\n\nBut wait, the third option's description says \"invest an initial amount of $3000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year.\" So the future_value function would calculate the future value, which is the same as the compound interest calculation. However, the user might have intended to use the calc_Compound_Interest function for that third option. But according to the user's instruction, they want to use future_value. So I need to use future_value for that third option.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4)\n2. calc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1)\n3. future_value(initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2)\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The annual_rate in the first two functions is in percentage, so 4 and 3.5, but the calc_Compound_Interest's annual_rate is in percentage, so that's correct. The future_value's interest_rate is a decimal (0.05), which is correct.\n\nSo the final answer should include these three function calls."}

They want three things: \n\n1. The number of all-time goals Cristiano Ronaldo scored for Manchester United in the Premier League.\n2. A comparison between that number and the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition.\n3. The top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The user provided three functions: team_stats.get_top_scorer, league_stats.get_top_scorer, and player_stats.get_all_time_goals. \n\nFor the first part, the player_stats.get_all_time_goals function seems appropriate. The parameters required are player_name, team_name, and competition. The user specified Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United, and Premier League. So I'll call this function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the second part asks to compare the all-time goals of Ronaldo with the top scorer of Manchester United in the Premier League. To get the top scorer, I need to use team_stats.get_top_scorer with team_name \"Manchester United\" and competition \"Premier League\". Once I have both numbers, I can compare them.\n\nThird, the third part requires the top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season. The league_stats.get_top_scorer function takes league_name and season as parameters. Here, the league_name is \"Premier League\" and the season is \"2019-2020\". So I'll call this function with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly specified. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I'll use the defaults where applicable. For example, the competition for the player stats is the Premier League, which is the default for that function. The season for the league stats is the default \"2019-2020\", which matches the user's request.\n\nSo, the function calls would be:\n\n1. player_stats.get_all_time_goals with player_name=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\".\n2. team_stats.get_top_scorer with team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\".\n3. league_stats.get_top_scorer with league_name=\"Premier League\", season=\"2019-2020\".\n\nEach of these functions will provide the required data. The user's question is about three separate pieces of information, so each function call addresses one part of the query."}

The user provided three functions: games.update.find, games.reviews.find, and games.price.find. Each requires specific parameters. \n\nFor the first part, the latest updates for Call of Duty on PlayStation Europe. The function games.update.find requires game, platform, and region. The game is \"Call of Duty\", platform is \"Playstation\", and region is \"European\". So I can call games.update.find with these parameters.\n\nNext, the current price for Call of Duty on Xbox. The games.price.find function needs game and platform. The game is \"Call of Duty\" and platform is \"Xbox\". So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the reviews for FIFA 21 from America. The games.reviews.find function takes game and region. The game is \"FIFA 21\" and region is \"American\". So that's the third call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly specified. The region for the updates is European, which is optional but specified here. The price is for Xbox, and the reviews are for America. All functions are applicable here.

They want a new restaurant serving chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce with max 500 calories. The restaurant_search function is suitable here. The ingredients are [\"chicken\", \"tomatoes\", \"lettuce\"], calories 500, and meal \"lunch\". But wait, the user mentioned \"new restaurant,\" so maybe the restaurant_search function can find one that matches the ingredients and calorie limit.\n\nThen, dinner.

So I need to call the modify_painting function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant for 100 years using the Darwin model. The prediction.evolution function is available. The species is African elephant, years=100, model='Darwin'. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. They want the probability of a royal flush in a 52-card deck, with 4 possible outcomes. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Here, total_outcomes is 52 cards, favorable is 4. They want it rounded to 3 decimal places.

So I'll call that with game_name='Animal Crossing', season='Summer', and item_type='fish'.\n\nNext, they asked for the highest score in 'Fortnite' on 'Playstation' in 'Asia' region. The game_score.highest function needs game, platform, region. So game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation', region='Asia'. \n\nThen, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function requires company_name, year, and case_type. The user didn't specify a case type, so I'll use the default 'all'. So company_name='Apple Inc.', year=2018, case_type='all'.\n\nLastly, binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, probability 0.7.
