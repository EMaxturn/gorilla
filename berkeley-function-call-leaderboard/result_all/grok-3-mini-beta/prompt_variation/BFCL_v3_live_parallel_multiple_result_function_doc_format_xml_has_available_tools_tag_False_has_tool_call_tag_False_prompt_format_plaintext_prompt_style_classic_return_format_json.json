It requires \"drink_id\" and \"new_preferences\".\n\n- drink_id: Probably \"123\" based on the user's message.\n- new_preferences: This is a dict, so I need to provide a dictionary of preferences.\n\nWhat should the dictionary contain?

It requires a 'location' parameter, which should be in the format like 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. It also has an optional 'unit' parameter for the unit system.\n\n2. **start_oncall**: This is for initiating support sessions, which doesn't match.\n\n3. **create_workspace**: This is for creating a workspace in some system, not relevant.\n\n4. **generate_password**: This is for generating passwords, completely unrelated.\n\nSo, the only relevant function is **get_current_weather**.\n\nFor **get_current_weather**, the parameters are:\n\n- **location**: Required. The user mentioned two locations: Guangzhou and Beijing in China. But this function seems designed for a single location per call, as it takes one 'location' string.\n\n- **unit**: Optional. The user specified \"\u516c\u5236\u5355\u4f4d\", which means \"metric units\". So, I should use \"metric\" for this.\n\nThe function call format allows me to make one or more function calls in a single response, as it's an array of objects.\n\nSince the user asked for two locations, I might need to make two separate calls: one for Guangzhou and one for Beijing.\n\nThe function description says: \"Retrieves the current weather conditions for a specified location\", implying one location per call.\n\nI should call the function twice, once for each city.\n\nFor the locations:\n\n- Guangzhou, China\n\n- Beijing, China\n\nI need to format them as per the description: 'City, Country' or 'City, State'. Since China doesn't use states in the same way, 'City, Country' should work, like 'Guangzhou, China' and 'Beijing, China'.\n\nFor the unit: The user wants metric units. The parameter is a string, probably something like \"metric\".\n\nIn my response, I need to output only the function calls in the specified JSON format.

Let me translate it:\n\n- \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\" means \"Living room, Air conditioner, Execute\" or \"Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\"\n\n- \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\" means \"Bedroom, Air purifier, Stop it\" or \"Turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\"\n\nSo, the user wants to perform two actions:\n\n1. Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n2. Turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, I need to see which one matches this.\n\nThe relevant function is \"ControlAppliance.execute\". Let's check its description:\n\n- It's for controlling home appliances, checking status, etc.\n\n- For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. In the params, it says the command must be in Korean, with room name, appliance name, and operation command, separated by commas.\n\n- Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- It specifies that for control, use 'power on' or 'start', but in the param description, it uses '\uc2e4\ud589' which means \"execute\" or \"start\".\n\nIn the function description: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nBut in the params example: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' \u2013 '\uc2e4\ud589' likely means \"execute\" which could be equivalent to starting or turning on.\n\nThe user said: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' and '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nSo, for the first one: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' \u2013 this matches the example directly.\n\nFor the second: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' \u2013 '\uc911\uc9c0' means \"stop\".\n\nThe function's param description says: \"the operation command\", and in examples, it has '\uc2e4\ud589' and '\uc911\uc9c0'.\n\nIt also notes: \"Note that this tool is not intended for describing, creating, deleting, or removing modes or routines.\" But we're just controlling, so that's fine.\n\nThe command needs to be a string in the format: room, appliance, command.\n\nThe user has two separate commands in one message. I need to make separate function calls for each, as each function call can only handle one command.\n\nThe function \"ControlAppliance.execute\" takes a single \"command\" parameter, which is a string.\n\nSo, I should make two separate function calls: one for each command.\n\nIn my response, I need to output a JSON array of function calls.\n\nThe format is: ```json [ {\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{...}}, {\"function\":\"func_name2\",\"parameters\":{...}} ] ```\n\nI can include multiple in one response.\n\nFor the first command: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nFor the second: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nI need to pass these as the \"command\" parameter.\n\nIs '\uc911\uc9c0' acceptable? The description says for control, it must specify 'power on' or 'start', but the example uses '\uc911\uc9c0', so probably yes, as it's an operation command.\n\nThe full description: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'.\" But then it gives examples with '\uc2e4\ud589' and '\uc911\uc9c0'. '\uc2e4\ud589' might be translated as 'start'.\n\nPerhaps 'power on' or 'start' is for English, but since the param is in Korean, '\uc2e4\ud589' is fine.\n\nI'll proceed assuming it's okay.\n\nSo, I need to call \"ControlAppliance.execute\" twice:\n\n1. With command: \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\"\n\n2. With command: \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\"\n\nThe user said: \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\"\n\nIt's not exactly in the format; it's combined. But I can extract them.\n\nIn the function, each call needs a single string command.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"function\": \"ControlAppliance.execute\", \"parameters\": {\"command\": \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"ControlAppliance.execute\", \"parameters\": {\"command\": \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\"}}\n]\n```\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAre there any other functions needed? No, this is straightforward appliance control.\n\nI should ensure that the commands are exactly as required. The example has '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', so matching that.\n\nOne potential issue: The function description says \"the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'\", but the param example uses '\uc2e4\ud589', which is Korean for 'execute' or 'run'. Since the entire command is in Korean, it should be fine.\n\nIf there's a mismatch, but based on the provided info, I'll go with it.\n\nFinal response: Just the JSON array as specified."}

Get the weather in Seoul, South Korea using Celsius units.\n\n2. Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n3. Find up-to-date information on the Imjin War.\n\nI need to handle these using the available functions.\n\nLet's match each request to the appropriate function:\n\n- For the weather: The function \"OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\" is perfect. It requires a \"location\" which should be in the format 'City, Country', so 'Seoul, South Korea'. It also has an optional \"units\" parameter, which can be 'metric' for Celsius.\n\n- For turning on the air conditioner: The function \"ControlAppliance.execute\" is for controlling home appliances. The command must be in Korean, and for turning on, it should specify 'power on' or 'start'. The example given is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' which means 'living room, air conditioner, execute' or turn on.\n\n  So, for \"turn on the air conditioner in the living room\", I need to translate that to: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'.\n\n- For information on the Imjin War: This seems like a historical topic, but the user says \"up-to-date information\". The Imjin War is from the 16th century, so it's not changing. However, the user specified \"up-to-date\", which might mean recent discussions or news about it. For this, I can use \"HNA_WQA.search\" which is for searching the web with keywords, as it's for topics that change frequently.\n\n  I could also use \"HNA_NEWS.search\" for news, but since it's historical, web search might be more appropriate.\n\nThe function descriptions:\n\n- HNA_WQA.search: For up-to-date information on topics that change, like current events.\n\n- HNA_NEWS.search: Specifically for news articles.\n\nSince the Imjin War is historical, it might not have \"news\", but perhaps recent articles or interpretations. I'll go with HNA_WQA.search as it's more general for web searches.\n\nNow, I need to make function calls. The response should only contain the JSON array of function calls, nothing else.\n\nI should call all necessary functions in one go if possible, since the instruction is to complete the tasks in the current turn.\n\nSo, I'll prepare calls for:\n\n1. OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather with location='Seoul, South Korea' and units='metric'.\n\n2. ControlAppliance.execute with command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' (assuming that's the correct Korean for \"living room, air conditioner, execute\").\n\n3. HNA_WQA.search with keyword='Imjin War'. I might specify language if needed, but it's not specified, so default is fine.\n\nThe user didn't specify language for the search, but since the query is in English, I'll assume English.\n\nFinally, format the response as a JSON array of objects, each with \"function\" and \"parameters\".\n\nResponse format:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name1\", \"parameters\": {\"param1\": \"value1\"} },\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name2\", \"parameters\": {\"param\": \"value\"} }\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSo, for this:\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"Seoul, South Korea\", \"units\": \"metric\"} },\n\n  {\"function\": \"ControlAppliance.execute\", \"parameters\": {\"command\": \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\"} },\n\n  {\"function\": \"HNA_WQA.search\", \"parameters\": {\"keyword\": \"Imjin War\"} }\n\n]\n\nThat seems complete."}

Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI have the following functions available:\n\n- clone_repo: This can clone the repository.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This generates Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This analyzes the repo to determine the predominant language.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This pushes changes, and it automatically adds all changes.\n\nThe user mentions \"based on the analysis,\" so I need to first analyze the repo before creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files. However, the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML don't directly take analysis results as input. They just need a directory name.\n\nLooking at analyse_repo_contents, it analyzes the directory and determines the predominant language, but it doesn't output anything that I can use directly in subsequent calls. In this setup, I have to chain the functions based on the logic.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to output a sequence of function calls in one response if possible.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. First, clone the repo. I need to use clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\n   - repo_url: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n\n   - Other parameters are optional.\n\n2. After cloning, analyze the contents. Use analyse_repo_contents with the directory name. What should the directory name be? The clone_repo will clone it to the current directory or specified one. If I don't specify, it goes to the current working directory. Let's assume it's cloned to a directory named after the repo, like \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n   In clone_repo, if destination is not specified, it clones to the current working directory. But typically, Git clones into a new directory with the repo name. I should specify a destination to be safe.\n\n   The function description: \"If omitted, the repository is cloned into the current working directory.\" But in practice, Git creates a subdirectory. I'll assume it's cloned into a directory like \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n   For analyse_repo_contents, I need to provide directory_name, which is the path relative to the root.\n\n   Let's say I clone it to \"nodejs-welcome\", so directory_name would be \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n3. Once analyzed, create Dockerfile: Use create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. Create Kubernetes YAML: Use create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name and other optional params.\n\n5. Then, add changes and push: Use push_git_changes_to_github, which automatically adds all changes.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github requires directory_name and optionally commit_message, etc.\n\nThe order should be:\n\n- First, call clone_repo.\n\n- Then, call analyse_repo_contents on the cloned directory.\n\n- Then, based on that, call create_a_docker_file.\n\n- Then, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n- Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nIn my response, I need to output all these as a list of function calls in one go, since the prompt says: \"you MUST put it in the format of ```json [array of function calls]```\"\n\nThe format is an array: [{\"function\":\"func1\", \"parameters\":{...}}, {\"function\":\"func2\", \"parameters\":{...}}]\n\nI can output multiple in one response.\n\nI need to specify the parameters correctly.\n\nFor clone_repo:\n\n- repo_url: \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\n- Let's specify destination as \"nodejs-welcome\" for clarity.\n\nFor analyse_repo_contents:\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\" (assuming that's where it was cloned)\n\nFor create_a_docker_file:\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n- Other params are optional; I can use defaults.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github:\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n- commit_message: Something like \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML\"\n\n- branch_name: Default, maybe \"main\"\n\nThe user didn't specify, so I'll use defaults where possible.\n\nOne potential issue: The analysis function doesn't feed directly into the creation functions. In a real system, the analysis might be used, but here, I just have to call them in sequence.\n\nAlright, so my response should be a JSON array of these function calls.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination.\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and a commit message.\n\nThe user said: \"2. analyse the contents of the repo and create following. 2.1 create/update dockerfile based on the analysis. 2.2 kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nI'm calling analyse first, then create docker, then create k8s, then push.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, I'll add a commit message: \"Automated addition of Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files.\"\n\nNow, format it properly."}

Estimate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at x = 5.\n\nI have two functions available:\n\n- math_gcd: This takes two positive integers, a and b, and calculates their GCD. It requires a and b, where a should be the larger one.\n\n- estimate_derivative: This takes a function, an x value, and optionally dx and method. The function needs to be a callable, like a lambda function.\n\nFor the first part: GCD of 36 and 48.\n\n- 48 is larger than 36, so I need to pass a=48 and b=36, but the description says \"a: The first and larger positive integer\", so I should ensure a is the larger one. In the params, it says a is the larger one, so I need to swap if necessary. 48 > 36, so a=48, b=36.\n\nI can call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36.\n\nFor the second part: Estimate the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x=5.\n\n- I need to provide a function. The function parameter is described as \"a callable function, like the lambda x\". So, I have to pass something like a lambda function.\n\nIn the response format, I need to output JSON for function calls. How do I represent a lambda function in JSON? The params say type=\"any\", so perhaps I can pass it as a string, like \"lambda x: x**2\".\n\nThe function description: \"A callable function for which the derivative will be estimated, like the lambda x\". It might expect a string representation.\n\nIn the context of this system, I think I need to pass it as a string in the JSON parameters.\n\nSo, for estimate_derivative, I can call it with:\n\n- function: \"lambda x: x**2\" (as a string)\n\n- x: 5\n\n- dx and method are optional, so I can omit them if not specified.\n\nThe user didn't specify dx or method, so I'll use defaults.\n\nThe user asked to do both things: first calculate GCD, then estimate the derivative.\n\nIn my response, I need to make one or more function calls in the specified JSON format.\n\nI should try to complete the tasks in the current turn, so I can call both functions in one response.\n\nThe format allows an array of function calls: ```json [ {\"function\":\"func1\", \"parameters\":{...}}, {\"function\":\"func2\", \"parameters\":{...}} ] ```\n\nSo, I can include both in one response.\n\nAfter these calls, if that's all, the system will handle the rest.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY be the JSON array, nothing else.\n\nSo, let's prepare the calls:\n\n1. For math_gcd:\n\n- function: \"math_gcd\"\n\n- parameters: {\"a\": 48, \"b\": 36}  // Since 48 > 36\n\n2. For estimate_derivative:\n\n- function: \"estimate_derivative\"\n\n- parameters: {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}\n\nI need to ensure the function is passed correctly. Assuming the system can handle it as a string.\n\nAlright, so the response should be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"function\": \"math_gcd\", \"parameters\": {\"a\": 48, \"b\": 36}},\n  {\"function\": \"estimate_derivative\", \"parameters\": {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}}\n]\n```\n\nThat seems correct."}

Since there are two separate actions, I should include both in my response as an array of function calls.\n\nThe format is:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{\"param1\":\"value1\"}},\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name2\",\"parameters\":{\"param2\":\"value2\"}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSo, for this, I'll have:\n\n1. First function: Services_1_FindProvider with city: \"Sunnyvale, CA\"\n\n2. Second function: Services_1_BookAppointment with stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time: \"15:00\", appointment_date: \"2023-05-10\"\n\nI should only return the function calls, nothing else.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can fulfill both in this turn, so I'll output both function calls.\n\nFinally, ensure the response is exactly in the JSON format specified."}

They specify \"in fahr\", which I assume means Fahrenheit.\n\nThe available functions include \"get_current_weather\", which is perfect for this. It retrieves the current weather for a specified location and has an optional parameter for the unit.\n\nThe function signature is:\n\n- name: \"get_current_weather\"\n\n- params:\n\n  - location: string, required. Format: 'City, State (abbr)', e.g., 'San Francisco, CA'\n\n  - unit: string, optional. This is where I can specify 'fahrenheit' or something similar.\n\nThe user said \"in fahr\", so I should use that for the unit. I need to check if the function accepts 'fahr'. The description says: \"The unit of measurement for temperature values.\" It doesn't specify exact strings, but commonly it's 'metric' or 'imperial'. I'll assume 'fahr' means Fahrenheit, so perhaps I should use 'imperial' or directly 'fahrenheit' if it accepts it. To be precise, I'll use 'fahrenheit' as it's straightforward.\n\nThe user wants weather for two locations: Boston, MA and San Francisco, CA.\n\nI need to make function calls. The system prompt says I can make one or more function calls in a single response, formatted as a JSON array.\n\nSo, I should call \"get_current_weather\" twice: once for Boston, MA and once for San Francisco, CA, both with unit as 'fahrenheit'.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So, I can handle both in this response.\n\nFormat for response: It must be exactly in the form of a JSON array of objects, like:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name1\", \"parameters\": {\"param1\": \"value1\"} },\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name2\", \"parameters\": {\"param\": \"value\"} }\n\n]\n\n```\n\nFor each call:\n\n1. For Boston, MA:\n\n   - function: \"get_current_weather\"\n\n   - parameters: {\"location\": \"Boston, MA\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}\n\n2. For San Francisco, CA:\n\n   - function: \"get_current_weather\"\n\n   - parameters: {\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}\n\nIs the state abbreviation correct? User said \"Boston, MA\" and \"San Francisco in fahr\", but I know it's CA for California. The user said \"San Francisco in fahr\", but in the function, it needs 'City, State (abbr)', so I'll use \"San Francisco, CA\".\n\nThe user said \"San Francisco in fahr\", implying the unit, not the state. So, yes.\n\nMy response should only contain the JSON array, nothing else.\n\nFinally, output:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"get_current_weather\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"Boston, MA\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"} },\n\n  {\"function\": \"get_current_weather\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"} }\n\n]\n\n```"}

It requires the 'name' parameter, and 'status' is optional.\n\n2. **partner.mandates**: This fetches mandates for a partner based on status. It doesn't take a user name; it takes only 'status' optionally.\n\nThe user is specifying users by name, so **user.mandates** seems appropriate because it allows fetching by user name.\n\nThe user wants mandates for two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\", and specifically for statuses \"pending\" and \"active\".\n\nFor each user, I might need to call **user.mandates** multiple times if I want both statuses separately, or if the function allows multiple statuses, but looking at the params, 'status' is a single string, not a list. So, I probably need to call it once per status per user.\n\nThe description says: \"the status of the mandates to be fetched.\" It doesn't specify if it can handle multiple statuses in one call. Since it's a single parameter, I'll assume it's for one status at a time.\n\nThe function might allow fetching multiple statuses if I pass something, but it's not specified. To be safe, I should call it separately for each status.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active mandates\", so for each user, I need both.\n\nPossible calls:\n\n- For user \"parath\", status \"pending\"\n\n- For user \"parath\", status \"active\"\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status \"pending\"\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status \"active\"\n\nThat would be four calls.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI need to output all necessary function calls in this response.\n\nThe response format is a JSON array of function calls.\n\nSo, I can include multiple function calls in one response array.\n\nMy response should be exactly in the format:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{...}},\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name2\",\"parameters\":{...}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any other text.\n\nIs there any missing parameter? For **user.mandates**, 'name' is required, and 'status' is optional. The user provided names and statuses, so that's fine.\n\nThe user said \"pending and active\", so I need to specify each.\n\nOne potential issue: Does the function accept multiple statuses? No, it's a single string. So, separate calls.\n\nPerhaps I can call it once per user with no status, but the function description says if status is not provided, it might fetch all, but the param says it's optional, and the desc: \"The status of the mandates to be fetched.\" If not provided, it might fetch all statuses.\n\nLet's check: For **user.mandates**, it says: \"based on the provided user name and the status of the mandates.\" And status is required=\"false\", so if not provided, it probably fetches all statuses.\n\nIn the description: \"Fetches the mandates associated with a user based on the provided user name and the status of the mandates.\"\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say what happens if status is not provided. To be precise, I should check the param desc: No additional info.\n\nIn the similar function **partner.mandates**, it says: \"If no status is provided, all mandates are retrieved.\"\n\nFor **user.mandates**, it doesn't specify, but perhaps it's the same logic.\n\nTo be safe, since the user specified \"pending and active\", I should either call with each status or call without to get all.\n\nIf I call without status, I get all, which includes pending and active, so that might be efficient.\n\nFor **user.mandates**, if I don't provide status, it should fetch all statuses for that user.\n\nThat would be perfect. So, for each user, I can just call once with the name and no status.\n\nThen, I get all mandates, including pending and active.\n\nThe user might want only those two, but since the function doesn't filter to exactly those, getting all is fine, as it includes what they want.\n\nThe function doesn't have a way to specify multiple statuses, so calling without status is the way to go.\n\nIn **partner.mandates**, it's explicit, but for **user.mandates**, I'll assume it's similar.\n\nSo, plan: Call **user.mandates** for \"parath\" with no status, and for \"bhanu\" with no status.\n\nThat way, I get all mandates for each, which includes pending and active.\n\nResponse: An array with two function calls.\n\nFirst: {\"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": {\"name\": \"parath\"}}\n\nSecond: {\"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": {\"name\": \"bhanu\"}}\n\nYes.\n\nIs \"parath\" and \"bhanu\" the full names? The param says: \"The full name of the partner's client\", so I'll assume that's what the user provided.\n\nAlright, let's format it."}
