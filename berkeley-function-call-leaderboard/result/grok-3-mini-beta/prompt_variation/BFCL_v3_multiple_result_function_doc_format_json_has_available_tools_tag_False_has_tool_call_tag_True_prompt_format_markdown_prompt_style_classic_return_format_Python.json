The user said \"New York\", so I'll go with that.\n\n- **art_form**: Required. The user said \"modern sculpture exhibition\". \"Sculpture\" is an art form, and \"modern\" might be a subset, but the parameter is for art form, e.g., \"sculpture\". I think \"sculpture\" fits.\n\n- **month**: Optional. It's described as \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" The user said \"in the upcoming month\", so I can omit this to get upcoming events, as per the default.\n\n- **user_ratings**: Optional. It's a string with options ['low', 'average', 'high'], and default is 'high'. The user said \"top rated\", which aligns with 'high' ratings. So, I should set this to 'high' to get the most popular/top rated ones.\n\nThe function description says: \"Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\". Since the user wants \"top rated\", using the default 'high' is perfect.\n\nTo make the function call:\n\n- location: \"New York\"\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (assuming \"modern sculpture\" means the art form is sculpture)\n\n- month: Not specified, so omit to get upcoming events.\n\n- user_ratings: \"high\" to ensure top rated.\n\nThe user said \"modern sculpture\". Is \"modern sculpture\" the art form? The parameter example is \"sculpture\", so I'll use \"sculpture\". If it's not exact, the function might handle it, but I have to go with what's available.\n\nRequired parameters are only 'location' and 'art_form', so I can make the call with those.\n\nMy response should only be in the <TOOLCALL> format.\n\nSo, I need to output: <TOOLCALL>[find_exhibition(location=\"New York\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI added user_ratings=\"high\" because it's relevant, and it's not required, so that's fine.\n\nThis should fulfill the user's request in one call. If more details are needed, the system can handle subsequent turns.\n\nFinally, ensure the format is exact: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>"}
{"id": "multiple_191", "result": "<TOOLCALL>[book_hotel(hotel_name=\"Hotel Paradise\", location=\"Las Vegas\", room_type=\"luxury room\", start_date=\"05-12-2022\", stay_duration=3, view=\"city view\")]</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 878, "output_token_count": 51, "latency": 4.133038520812988, "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants to book a hotel room. Looking at the available tools, there's a function called \"book_hotel\" that matches this.\n\nLet me check the parameters for \"book_hotel\":\n\n- hotel_name: The name of the hotel. User said \"Hotel Paradise\", so that's \"Hotel Paradise\".\n\n- location: The location of the hotel. User said \"Las Vegas\", so that's \"Las Vegas\".\n\n- room_type: The type of room preferred. User said \"luxury room\", so I'll use \"luxury room\".\n\n- start_date: The starting date of the stay in format MM-DD-YYYY. User said \"May 12, 2022\", which is \"05-12-2022\".\n\n- stay_duration: The duration of the stay in days. User said \"for 3 days\", so that's 3.\n\n- view: The preferred view from the room. User said \"with a city view\", so that's \"city view\". This is optional, but they specified it.\n\nThe function description says view has a default of 'No preference', and it's not required, so I can include it.\n\nAll required parameters are present: hotel_name, location, room_type, start_date, and stay_duration.\n\nSo, I can make a function call to \"book_hotel\" with these parameters.\n\nThe tool call format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI need to output only that, nothing else.\n\nLet me construct it:\n\nfunc_name: book_hotel\n\nparams:\n\n- hotel_name=\"Hotel Paradise\"\n\n- location=\"Las Vegas\"\n\n- room_type=\"luxury room\"\n\n- start_date=\"05-12-2022\"  (converting May 12, 2022 to MM-DD-YYYY)\n\n- stay_duration=3\n\n- view=\"city view\"\n\nYes, that seems complete.\n\nThis should fulfill the user's request in one turn. Once I call this function, the system will handle it.\n\nFinal output should be just the TOOLCALL section."}
