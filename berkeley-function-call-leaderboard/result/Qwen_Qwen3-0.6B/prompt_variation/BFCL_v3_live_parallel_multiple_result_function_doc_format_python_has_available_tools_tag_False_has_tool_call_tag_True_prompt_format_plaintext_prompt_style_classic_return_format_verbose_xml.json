There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for changing drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function can handle this. The parameters required are foodItem, newIngredients, and specialInstructions. The default for newIngredients is an empty string, so I need to specify \"without anchovies\" there. The specialInstructions might be optional, but since the user didn't mention it, maybe leave it as default.\n\nThen, for the drink order, the user provided drink_id 123 and new_preferences. The ChaDri.change_drink function takes drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences should be a dictionary with key-value pairs. The user said \"regular sweetness and almond milk,\" so the new_preferences would be {\"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\"}.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted.

The user wants to perform several actions on a GitHub repository. First, they need to clone the repo. The first step is to use the clone_repo function. The parameters required are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. The user provided the URL as git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so I'll set the destination to the current directory since it's the default.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes a directory_name. The user hasn't specified the directory, but since the clone was done, the destination is the current directory. So I'll call that function with the directory name as the current path.\n\nThen, they want to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The user hasn't provided the directory, but after cloning, the destination is the current directory. So I'll use that. Similarly, create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user hasn't provided all these details, so I'll need to make assumptions or use defaults. The default image is 'latest', so maybe use that. The default port is 80, and service_type is ClusterIP. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll have to leave them as defaults unless told otherwise.\n\nAfter that, they need to add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't provided these, so I'll have to use defaults. The commit message defaults to 'Update changes', branch to 'main', and force_push as False.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push function does that by default. So maybe the commit message and branch are optional. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed with the defaults.\n\nPutting it all together, the function calls should be:\n\n1. clone_repo with the given URL and default destination.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with the current directory.\n3. create_a_docker_file with the current directory.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the current directory, assuming default values.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with default parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's parameters again to ensure they match the user's requirements. Yes, all parameters are covered. So the final answer should include these five function calls."}

The user is trying to fix a compilation error in their Java project. The error is that the method 'getNumericValue()' isn't found in 'CellResult'. They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the get_relevant_classes function seems relevant. The parameters for that function include a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case-sensitive parameter can be set to true if the user wants to match case, but since the error is about 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is needed. The include_subdirectories parameter should be set to true to include subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. The class here is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the methods are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter can be set to true if the user wants to include private methods, but since the error is about the methods, maybe just including them is sufficient. The function call would need to specify both method names and include_private as true.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found, but the get_relevant_classes function is for finding related classes. The get_signature function is for retrieving method signatures. So the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with 'CellResult' and include subdirectories, then call get_signature with 'AbstractCellHandler' for the methods. Also, check if the parameters are correctly set. The get_relevant_classes has a case_sensitive parameter, which defaults to false. If the user wants case sensitivity, set it to true. But since the error is about 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is needed. The user might not have specified case sensitivity, so perhaps leave it as default.

The function requires a 'size' parameter, which is the length of one side. Since the user provided 5 cm, I can use that. So I'll call get_area_of_square with size 5.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The user mentioned Queenstown Singapore, so I need to use the get_current_weather function. The location parameter should be 'Queenstown Singapore'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll leave it as the default 'fahrenheit' if it's not provided.\n\nWait, but the default unit is 'fahrenheit', but the user didn't specify.
