The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures: a 4ft x4ft marble statue in the Philadelphia museum and a 6ft x3ft bronze sculpture in the New York museum. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The details function gives material and size from the museum database, but the user already provided the material and size for both sculptures. Wait, maybe they want to confirm those details first? But the question is about the price, so maybe they need to use get_artwork_price directly.\n\nLooking at the parameters for get_artwork_price: it requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size (as an array of integers). The user provided all these details for both sculptures. For the first one, museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is [4,4]. The second is New York, bronze, [6,3]. \n\nWait, but the function might calculate the price based on those parameters. However, the user is asking for the average price of both. So maybe I need to call the get_artwork_price function twice, once for each sculpture, and then compute the average of the two prices returned. \n\nBut the functions available don't mention an average function. So the steps would be: call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, get their prices, then calculate the average. Since the user's question is about the average, I need to make two separate function calls. \n\nWait, but the user might have provided all necessary parameters. Let me check again. The first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is 4x4 (so array [4,4]). The second: New York, bronze, 6x3 (array [6,3]). \n\nSo I need to call get_artwork_price twice with these parameters. Then take the two prices and compute their average. But the functions don't have an average function, so the user would need to do that. But the assistant's job is to call the functions. So the answer would be to make two function calls and then present the average. \n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"average price of a... and a...\", so the assistant needs to get both prices and then compute the average. However, the functions provided don't include a way to perform calculations, so the assistant must output the function calls in the specified format. \n\nWait, but the user might not have provided all the parameters. Let me check the parameters again. The functions are in the list, and the user is asking for the average price of a product.
