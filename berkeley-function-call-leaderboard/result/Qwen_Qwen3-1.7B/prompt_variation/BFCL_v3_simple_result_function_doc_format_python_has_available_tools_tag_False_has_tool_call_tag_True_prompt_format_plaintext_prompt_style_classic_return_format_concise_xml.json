Wait, the function's database parameter has a default, so maybe it's not necessary to include it. But the user mentioned the database, so maybe they want to specify it. However, the function's default is already 'CustomerInfo', so including it might be redundant. But the problem says to use the given parameters.

Since the database is default, maybe it's okay to omit it. But the function's parameters have a default, so the user might not need to include it. But the user's instruction says to update in the database, so maybe the database is required. Wait, the function's parameters have database as a str with default 'CustomerInfo'.

So I should create a list with two elements: one for age greater than 25 and another for job equal to 'engineer'. \n\nWait, the conditions are passed as a list. So the list should have tuples? Or maybe each condition is a separate element. The function's docstring says conditions is a list, but it's not clear if each element is a condition. Maybe each element is a tuple (column, operator, value). But the user's query is age > 25 and job = 'engineer'. So perhaps the conditions list should be [[age, '>', 25], [job, '=', 'engineer']]. \n\nBut the function's parameters are table and conditions. So the user's query requires two conditions.

So maybe the user wants the start_date to be the earliest possible date, which is 01-01-2021. But the user said \"after\", so perhaps the start_date should be set to a date later than that. But since the user didn't provide a specific date, maybe the function can handle it. Wait, the function's description says \"within a specific date range and location\". So the start_date is the start of the range. If the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be 01-01-2021, and the end_date would be a later date.

The user called the music.theory.chordProgression function with a progression of ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV']. I need to figure out what the function does. The description says it identifies a potential key signature based on the chord progression. The parameters include progression, returnAllPossibleKeys, and assumeMajor.\n\nThe user provided the progression, so the function is expecting that. The default for returnAllPossibleKeys is false, so if it's not specified, it'll return the first valid key. The assumeMajor is set to true by default, which means it'll assume the key is major if possible. \n\nWait, the progression has 'vi' which is a minor chord. If the key is major, then the minor chords would be in the key of minor. But if the key is minor, then 'vi' is a minor chord. So the function might return the key as minor. But since the progression includes 'vi', which is a minor chord, the key is likely minor. However, the function's assumption is that if assumeMajor is true, it'll check if the progression fits a major key. But since there's a minor chord, maybe it's not major. \n\nBut the user didn't specify whether to return all possible keys or just the first. Since returnAllPossibleKeys is false by default, it'll return the first valid key. So the function will process the progression and determine the key. The actual result depends on the function's internal logic, but the user just wants the function called with the given parameters. \n\nSo the correct call is to invoke the function with the provided progression. The other parameters are defaults, so they don't need to be specified. Therefore, the tool call is music.theory.chordProgression with the given progression."}

So, I should call find_card_in_deck with rank 'Queen', suit 'Hearts', and deck as the standard deck. But how to represent the standard deck in the function? The function's parameters expect a list.

The function's default for maxCalories is 1000, but the user specified less than 500, so I should set maxCalories to 499. Wait, but the function's parameter is maxCalories, and the description says it's the maximum calorie content. So if the user wants less than 500, setting maxCalories to 499 would ensure that.
