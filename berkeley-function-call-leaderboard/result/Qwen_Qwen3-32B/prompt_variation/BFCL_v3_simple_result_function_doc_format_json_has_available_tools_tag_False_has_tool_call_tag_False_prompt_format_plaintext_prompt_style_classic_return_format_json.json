But the user explicitly mentioned 'ongoing', so maybe include it to be safe. \n\nSo the parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'. \n\nWait, the function's parameters require company, start_date, location. Status is optional. So even though the user says 'ongoing', since it's the default, maybe it's not necessary to include. But the user specified it, so including it might be better. But according to the function's description, the default is ongoing. So if the user wants ongoing, we can omit it. But to be precise, maybe include it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The status parameter has an enum of ongoing, settled, dismissed. The default is ongoing. So if the user wants ongoing, we can leave it out. But since the user explicitly mentioned it, maybe include it. However, the function will handle the default, so maybe it's redundant. \n\nBut the user's query is to search for ongoing lawsuits.

The user says \"filed after January 1, 2021\". Does that mean the start_date is inclusive? For example, if the lawsuit was filed on Jan 1, 2021, would that be included? The user says \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be Jan 2, 2021. But the user wrote \"after January 1, 2021\", which is a bit ambiguous. In common usage, \"after\" could mean starting from the next day. But maybe the function includes the start_date as the lower bound. The user might intend to include Jan 1, 2021 and onwards. But the exact interpretation depends on the function's implementation. Since the user wrote \"after January 1, 2021\", perhaps the start_date should be 01-01-2021. But if the function is designed to include the start_date, then that's correct. \n\nSo I'll proceed with start_date as 01-01-2021. \n\nPutting it all together, the function call is correct."}

The parameters they want are 'rating' and 'player count'. Both are in the enum list. So I need to call the function with the name, and the parameters array including those two. The language can default to English. So the function call should be:\n\n{\n  \"function\": \"boardgame.get_info\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"name\": \"Ticket to Ride\",\n    \"parameters\": [\"rating\", \"player count\"]\n  }\n}\n\nI think that's all. No missing parameters here. The required fields are name and parameters, which are both provided."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the find_card_in_deck function. It requires rank, suit, and an optional deck parameter. The user didn't mention a specific deck, so the default standard deck should be used. So I need to call the function with rank 'Queen' and suit 'Hearts'. The deck parameter isn't required here since it's optional and not provided. So the function call should include just the rank and suit. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function's requirements. Yep, the required fields are rank and suit. So the correct JSON would be [{\"function\": \"find_card_in_deck\", \"parameters\": {\"rank\": \"Queen\", \"suit\": \"Hearts\"}}]."}
{"id": "simple_360", "result": "```json\n[{\"function\":\"find_recipe\",\"parameters\":{\"recipeName\":\"pasta carbonara\",\"maxCalories\":500}}]\n```", "input_token_count": 376, "output_token_count": 561, "latency": 12.356124639511108, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants a recipe for pasta carbonara with less than 500 calories. I need to use the find_recipe function. The function requires the recipe name and has an optional maxCalories parameter. The required parameter is recipeName, which is \"pasta carbonara\". The maxCalories should be set to 500. Let me check the parameters again. The default for maxCalories is 1000, but the user wants less than 500, so I should set it to 500. Wait, the function's parameter for maxCalories is an integer, and the user says \"less than 500\", so maybe setting maxCalories to 500 would include recipes with exactly 500? But the user wants less than that. Hmm, but the function might not support a minCalories parameter. The function only has maxCalories. So to get recipes under 500, setting maxCalories to 499 would be more accurate. But the user might have intended 500 as the upper limit. The function's default is 1000, so if I set maxCalories to 500, it should return recipes with up to 500 calories. However, the user specified \"less than 500\", so maybe 499 is better. But perhaps the function is designed to handle \"less than or equal\" with maxCalories. The description says \"maximum calorie content\", which implies it's inclusive. So to strictly follow the user's request, maybe set maxCalories to 499. But the user might not mind if it's exactly 500. Since the function's default is 1000, and the user wants less than 500, I'll set maxCalories to 500. Wait, no, if the user says \"less than 500\", then 500 is not included. So the correct value should be 499. But maybe the function allows for that. Let me proceed with maxCalories as 500, but I should note that. Alternatively, the user might have made a typo and meant up to 500. Since the function's parameter is maxCalories, I'll use 500 as the value. So the parameters would be recipeName: \"pasta carbonara\" and maxCalories: 500. That should work."}
