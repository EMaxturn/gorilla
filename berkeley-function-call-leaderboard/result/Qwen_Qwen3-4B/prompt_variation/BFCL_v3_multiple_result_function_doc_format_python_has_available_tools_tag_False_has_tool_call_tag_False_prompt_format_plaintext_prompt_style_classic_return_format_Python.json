The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The given parameters are initial speed of 20 m/s, acceleration of 10 m/s\u00b2, and time of 5 seconds. The function needed here is kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check the parameters required for that function. The function requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. All the necessary parameters are provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional and defaults to 2, which is acceptable. So I should call the calculate_displacement function with these values. There's no mention of rounding, so I'll use the default. That's all the info needed. No missing parameters here."}

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price, I should use store_price. The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided, so I can call store_price with these values. The other functions don't relate to price directly, so they aren't needed here. I don't see any missing parameters, so the correct function call is store_price with the given arguments."}

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, which the user has provided: 7 and 10 respectively. \n\nSo I should call that function with width=7 and length=10. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here. No missing parameters here since both width and length are given.

The available functions are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The question mentions the object started from rest, so initial speed is 0. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's for objects starting from rest. \n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest: it requires distance and time. The user provided both: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which is already the case here. So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. \n\nWait, but the function's description says it calculates the speed based on distance, time, and initial speed. Since initial speed is zero, the function should handle that. So the correct call would be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. That should give the final speed. I don't need to use the other function because we don't have acceleration or time for that. The parameters here are all provided, so no missing info. Alright, that's the function to call."}

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they are the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they are the same gas, the formula simplifies to (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) / (quantity1 + quantity2). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. For ideal gases, when mixing, the total internal energy is the sum of the individual internal energies. Assuming the process is at constant volume, the internal energy change would be proportional to the number of moles and temperature. So, the final temperature should be (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2). \n\nSo in this case, n1 is 2, T1 is 300 K, n2 is 3, T2 is 400 K. Plugging in the numbers: (2*300 + 3*400)/(2+3) = (600 + 1200)/5 = 1800/5 = 360 K. \n\nThe function provided is calculate_final_temperature, which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. So I need to call that function with the given values. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info. So the correct function call is calculate_final_temperature with quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400."}

Since the user specified ascending order, I can use the default value. So I need to call sort_list with elements set to the provided list and order as 'asc'. \n\nWait, the parameters are elements (list) and order (str, default 'asc'). The user's list is ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], so that's the elements. The order is ascending, which is the default. So the function call should be sort_list(elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], order='asc'). \n\nBut since order is optional and defaults to 'asc', maybe I can omit it. But the user explicitly said ascending, so including it makes it clear. Either way should work, but including the order parameter here is better to ensure it's sorted correctly as per the user's request.\n\nSo the correct function call is sort_list with the elements and order specified."}

So the desired_sum is 7, n_rolls is 2. I don't think the sides_per_die is specified, so I can leave it as default. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2).
