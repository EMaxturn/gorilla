The user wants to find out how fast an object was going if it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are some kinematic equations. The problem mentions starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. The functions provided include 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Let me check the parameters for that function. The function requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, so even if it's not specified, it's okay. So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. Wait, the parameters for that function are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default=0). The user said started from rest, so initial_speed is 0. But since the function has a default, maybe I don't need to include it. But the user's question is about the final speed, right? So the function should calculate the final speed based on distance, time, and initial speed. Let me make sure I'm using the correct function. The other function is calculate_acceleration, but the user isn't asking for acceleration directly. The question is about the final speed. So yes, calculate_speed_from_rest is the right choice here. The parameters are distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's default, maybe it's optional. So the function call should be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. Let me check the function's parameters again. The function's args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default=0). So the user provided distance and time, and since initial_speed is default, we can omit it. So the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4.

The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the colder one. But since they're the same gas, maybe it's a weighted average? Wait, the formula for final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas would be (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. That makes sense because it's like a weighted average based on the amount of each gas.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. Perfect, that's exactly what's needed here. The parameters are all integers, which matches the given values. So I just need to plug in the numbers: quantity1=2, temp1=300, quantity2=3, temp2=400. The function should compute (2*300 + 3*400)/(2+3) = (600 + 1200)/5 = 1800/5 = 360 K. So the final temperature would be 360 K.

Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, and there's n_rolls and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the function's default for n_rolls is 1, but the user is rolling two dice. So I need to set n_rolls=2. The desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die isn't mentioned, but standard dice have 6 sides. However, the function's parameters don't have a default for sides_per_die. Wait, checking the function definition again: the parameters are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int, default 1), sides_per_die (int). Oh, the user didn't specify the number of sides, but since it's standard dice, I can assume 6. But wait, does the function require it? If the function requires sides_per_die, but the user didn't provide it, I need to include it. But maybe the default is 6? Wait, the function's parameters don't have a default for sides_per_die. Wait, looking back: the function's args are desired_sum, n_rolls (default 1), sides_per_die. So sides_per_die is required.

Default is 1\n    sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die.\n\nWait, the sides_per_die doesn't have a default. So the user's question doesn't mention the number of sides. But in standard dice, it's 6. However, the function requires it. So do I need to include it? The user didn't specify, but maybe the function assumes 6? Or is it required? Since the function's parameters don't have a default for sides_per_die, I think it's required. But the user didn't mention it. Hmm. But the question says \"rolling a sum of 7 on a roll of two dice.\" So the dice are standard, 6-sided. So I should include sides_per_die=6.
