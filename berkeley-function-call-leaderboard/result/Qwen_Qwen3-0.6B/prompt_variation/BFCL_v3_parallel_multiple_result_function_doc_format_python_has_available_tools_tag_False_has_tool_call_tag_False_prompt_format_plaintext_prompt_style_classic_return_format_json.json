There's get_sculpture_details which takes a museum location and a sculpture ID. The get_artwork_price function requires a museum location, sculpture material, and size. \n\nThe user provided both sculptures' locations but didn't specify their IDs. So, I can't use get_sculpture_details for both unless I assume IDs. But the problem is that the user didn't give the IDs.

For the bronze sculpture, material is bronze, size is 6x3 ft. But the problem is that the get_artwork_price function requires the material and size. So if I can get those details, I can call get_artwork_price for each. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the IDs. So maybe I need to make two separate calls. However, the user's question is about average price, which would require knowing the individual prices. But without the IDs, I can't get the details. \n\nWait, maybe the functions can be used even without IDs? The get_sculpture_details function requires a sculpture_id, but the user didn't provide it. So perhaps the answer is that I can't retrieve the prices without the IDs. But the user's question is about the average price, so maybe there's a way to infer the IDs from the locations?

Since the functions can't be used without the IDs, perhaps the answer is that no function calls can be made. \n\nWait, but the user's question is about the average price, so maybe there's a way to use the functions. Let me think again. For each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with the material and size. The user provided the material and size for each. So even if the IDs are missing, maybe the function can be called with the locations and the materials and sizes. But the get_artwork_price function requires the material and size. So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price with the given material and size. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided the IDs. So maybe the answer is that I can't retrieve the prices because the IDs are missing. However, the user's question is about the average price, so perhaps the answer is that I can't proceed without the IDs. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is to state that the required parameters are missing.

So maybe the answer is that no function calls can be made. \n\nWait, but the user's question is about the average price, so maybe the answer is that I can't retrieve the prices because the IDs are missing. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameters are missing. But according to the problem statement, if none of the functions can be used, point it out. So in this case, the answer would be that the required parameters are missing. \n\nBut the user's question requires two function calls. So perhaps I need to make two function calls. For each sculpture, call get_artwork_price with the material and size. Even if the IDs are missing, maybe the function can be called with the locations. Wait, no, the get_artwork_price function requires the material and size. The locations are provided, but the function doesn't take a location. So the function can be called with the material and size. \n\nSo for the first sculpture, material is marble, size is [4,4]. For the second, material is bronze, size is [6,3]. The museum locations are Museum of Philadelphia and New York. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nget_artwork_price(museum_location=\"Museum of Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4])\n\nget_artwork_price(museum_location=\"New York museum\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3])\n\nBut the user's question is about the average price. However, the functions don't provide the average, only individual prices. So the answer would be that the average price can't be determined without the individual prices. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, if none of the functions can be used, point it out. So in this case, the functions can be used, but the result is two separate prices. The average would require combining them. However, the user's question is about the average, so maybe the answer is that the average can't be determined without the individual prices. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the functions can be used, make the calls.

The default for efficiency is 10%, so that's already covered, but maybe I should include it explicitly just to be safe.\n\nSecond part: Calculate biomass given energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step is the total energy, which I'll get from the first function. Then multiply by the efficiency (10% or 0.1). So, I need to call biological.calc_biomass with the energy from the first function and the efficiency.\n\nThird part: Calculate work done by the machine.

The user wants to change the size to 30x40 inches, medium to oil, and dominant color to red. So, I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size is 30x40, medium is oil, dominant color is red. So, the first function call should be modify_painting with those parameters.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The function prediction.evolution requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years 100, model Darwin. So, another function call here.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The user wants the probability of getting a royal flush. The probability function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52 cards, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. So, calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function again. Modify_painting parameters are size, medium, dominant_color. The user specified oil and red, which are correct. The evolutionary rate function has all the required parameters. The poker probability function also has all the required parameters. So, all three function calls are needed."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The house has an area of 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. So I need to use the predict_house_price function. The parameters required are area, rooms, year, and location. All these are provided, so I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the default state is California, but the user specified San Francisco, I should include that. So I'll call lawsuit_search with those parameters.\n\nThen, the probability part: total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user wants the result rounded to 3 decimals. So I'll call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function again. Yes, all required parameters are there. No missing parameters. So the three function calls should cover all parts of the user's request."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of Apple Inc.'s lawsuits in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: get_collectables_in_season. The game is Animal Crossing, season is Summer, and item_type should be 'fish'. So that's one function call.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The function game_score.highest requires game, platform, and region. So game is Fortnite, platform is Playstation, region Asia. That's another call.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The function lawsuit_details.find needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user didn't specify case_type, so default is all. So company is Apple Inc., year 2018.\n\nLastly, binomial probability. The function calculate_binomial_probability needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. So all parameters are given, so that's the third function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function's required parameters again. Yes, all are covered. No missing parameters. So the four function calls should be correct."}
