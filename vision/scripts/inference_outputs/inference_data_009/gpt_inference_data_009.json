Caitlin wore a white jersey in round 3, and since she didn't make it to the quarters, that narrows it down. In this quarter-finals, I recognize Caroline Marks along with others. The only Americans who made it are Caroline and Carissa Moore, but Carissa lost to Johanne Defay. Carissa usually wears Billabong but sometimes has Roxy logos. It's tricky to be sure! Identifying Caroline Marks' score I noticed that the image features the Roxy brand on the collar, which suggests it’s Caroline Marks since she’s a Roxy-sponsored athlete on Team USA. Caroline's definitely the one here! Now, to find out her score for the event, I need to clarify which event we're talking about. I see the total score of 7.77 for her on the quarter-finals table. But did she mean a specific heat score? The user’s question is a bit vague, so I’ll check the Reuters article for more details on her performance."

        "reasoning_trace": "Analyzing surfing event details I see that the mention of Paris 2024 ties it to the Summer Olympics, where surfing is scheduled at Tahiti. Since today's date is August 22, 2025, this image might actually be from the previously held Paris 2024 surfing event. The surfer in the image, wearing 'ROXY', could possibly be Caroline Marks, but her jersey would typically include her last name. The name might be 'Maryu' or 'Mariya' instead. Now, the user is asking about the score this individual received for the event. Clarifying surfing score inquiry I realize I need more context here. The user likely wants to know about the surfer in the image and her score from the Paris 2024 Olympic women's surfing event. It's possible this is Caroline Marks, but if it’s Carissa Moore, I can see she’s backed by Roxy and competed in both Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. I wonder if she won a medal in Paris and how to confirm that. I should search for Carissa Moore's score from the Paris event to provide a solid answer. Analyzing the surfer image I’m checking out the details in the image of a female surfer in Paris 2024 colors holding a board with the US flag. I think it looks like Carissa Moore, who wears Roxy gear. Caroline Marks is ruled out since her sponsor isn’t Roxy. Carissa is sponsored by Roxy and Quiksilver. She competed in heat 8 of the women's surfing Round 1 at the Olympics, scoring 16.50. But, the question about the score is unclear regarding the specific event. Investigating Carissa Moore's score I’m looking into a Reuters caption that mentions Carissa Moore competing in the women’s surfing event at the Paris 2024 Olympics, where she scored 16.50 in her opening heat on July 27, 2024. The question about her score possibly links back to this caption. There’s a note about her score ranking on the first day. The specific breakdown from NBC shows she scored 9.00 and 7.50 in Round 1. Next, I'll search for the Reuters caption directly to confirm her score."

        "reasoning_trace": "Identifying player details I’m looking for details about the Northwestern Wildcats basketball roster for 2023-24, specifically player #5, whose last name is Martin. I initially thought it might be AJ Hoggard, but that’s actually from Michigan State. I also considered players like Pete Nance and Jaylon Tate, but they don’t seem right either. The purple and white colors fit with Northwestern. I wonder if there could be a player from Northwestern State instead. It’s tricky! Searching for player stats I’ve confirmed that the player I'm looking for is a defender from the Northwestern Wildcats, wearing jersey number 5 with the last name Martin. Now, I need to find out his three-point percentage for the 2023-24 college season since Northwestern is in the Big Ten conference. It seems like he could be a guard, so I'll look specifically for the Northwestern basketball roster for 2023-24 to pinpoint the right Martin and gather that information. Clarifying player stats I realize that the page I'm viewing is for the 2024-2025 season, while I'm looking for stats for the 2023-2024 season. The defender has \"MARTIN\" on his jersey, which got me thinking about Northwestern's roster. While Nick Martinelli has a different last name, I'm considering whether it could be Martin O'Doherty or someone else. There's also Boo Buie, who wore #2 and left for the NBA after the 2022-2023 season, but oddly, it seems he's now listed as departed. Identifying the player I'm considering Ryan Langborg, but his name has an unusual spelling. I wonder if the uniform belongs to Northwestern or potentially Northwestern State. Then I think about Kansas State’s colors, but that's in the Big 12, while the opponent is Maryland, which complicates things since Kansas State usually doesn't play them in conference. Ultimately, I narrow it down to Big Ten teams, and since \"MARTIN\" is a clear name on the jersey, I'm nearly certain it's a player from Northwestern. Searching for player info I suspect the defender is from Northwestern, though I'm weighing Minnesota as an option since I first wonder if the colors match. Minnesota has maroon and gold, while this jersey is solid purple with white piping, which is definitely a Northwestern look. I initially think about players like Lester Quinones, but that's off track since he's with the Golden State. I also consider CJ Fredrick, but again no matches. With \"Martin\" as a name possibility that fits, I’ll check Northwestern's official roster for 2023-24. Analyzing team jerseys I'm piecing together the season roster. There's no \"Martin,\" but Nick Martinelli (#2) has his jersey read as \"MARTINELLI\" instead. The jersey in the image reads \"MARTIN,\" which makes me wonder if it belongs to a defender from another Big Ten team. Northwestern uses purple, while Michigan State's alternates are green. Maryland's red and white complicate things too. It seems likely that the player is from Maryland, facing off against Northwestern. Identifying the defender It looks like Maryland is the team with the ball, wearing white jerseys with red lettering. The defender in the purple uniform seems to be from Northwestern, but there's a “MARTIN” on the jersey, which complicates things. After considering various teams, I realize Northwestern is the only fitting option, despite not having a player named Martin listed on the roster. Maybe it could be a transfer or a spelling issue. But it seems quite certain that the defender is from Northwestern. Exploring Minnesota's roster I’m considering if maroon could appear purple on camera, and while Minnesota's official color is maroon, it’s possible that the varsity jerseys could look purple due to distortion. I want to check for any \"Martin\" last names on the Minnesota roster, so I think it’s best to search for the \"2023-24 Minnesota Golden Gophers basketball roster.\" That might help clear up this confusion! Identifying Players and Stats I'm looking at the Proballers page for Minnesota stats, specifically focusing on the defender's team and their 3P% for the 2023-24 season. The image shows a Maryland player in a white uniform making a shot, while a purple jersey defender is nearby. The white jersey has \"M\" on the shorts and an Under Armour logo, confirming it’s a Maryland player. The defender's purple jersey has \"MARTIN\" on it, so I need to find their stats next. Clarifying Teams and Players I'm trying to identify the teams and players in the image. It can't be Northwestern since they use \"Wildcats.\" There isn’t a player named Martin on their roster, so I wonder if it could be a women's game, but both players look male. The Maryland player is likely Jahmir Young, who's a guard known for being a ball-handler, has a beard, and matches the description. Given the context, it seems this image is from a Maryland home game against Northwestern, where Northwestern would wear their purple away jerseys. Investigating the Defender's Identity I’m checking Northwestern’s roster for a player with the last name Martin, but number 2 is Nick Martinelli, and no one else has that last name. It’s possible the defender's jersey shows “MARTIN,” identifying another player, maybe from a different team. I consider Kansas State, but it’s a Big Ten game, so that doesn’t fit. The only purple team here is Northwestern, which leads me to think the defender is indeed from Northwestern, despite the name discrepancy. It might be worth looking closer at Minnesota, especially since they have a player named Martin too. Clarifying team details I'm considering the Maryland Terrapins, who are part of the Big Ten Conference, and how they're facing off against Northwestern. The question is about a defender's three-point percentage this season. It seems the defender is from Northwestern, given the purple jersey. However, that's tricky since I can't see their number, and I'm looking for a player named Martin, but there doesn't appear to be a Martin listed on the Northwestern roster. Identifying the defender It looks like the defender is in a purple uniform with white stripes, which identifies them as a Northwestern player. But the only player with the last name Martin seems to relate to earlier seasons or possibly a staff member. I've checked the current recruiting class and didn't find anyone with that name, nor did I see any transfers. The jersey should have an Under Armour logo if it's from Maryland, but since it's from Northwestern and sponsored by Nike, that theory doesn't hold. It reinforces that the defender is indeed a Northwestern player. Analyzing jersey details I can't see an Under Armour logo on the jersey, and the swoosh I see might be from Nike. The jersey has \"MARTIN\" printed above the number, which is 5. That aligns with a player named Ryan Langborg, but his last name has 7 letters, so it doesn’t match. I’m considering if there's a chance it could be \"Langston Martin,\" but that name isn't on the roster. It's possible the defender is actually Nick Martinelli. Since his last name is long, it might be shortened to \"MARTIN\" on the jersey! Determining jersey details It seems like basketball jerseys usually print full last names, but sometimes they truncate them to fit, especially if the name is long. Nick Martinelli's name might be shortened on the jersey, showing \"MARTIN\" instead. I’m a bit confused by the defender's number, which looks like it could be either 2 or 5. The angles make it hard to tell, and I need to be sure about which team it is. Maybe I should check the Washington Huskies roster next, just in case! Analyzing name visibility I’m noticing that the Washington Proballers roster doesn’t list anyone named Martin. So, I’m concluding that the defender with the name on the jersey is actually from Northwestern. It could be that \"MARTIN\" is misread, possibly due to cropping of the image. The name might actually be \"MARTINELLI,\" but only part of it is visible above the number. Since we can only see a few letters, I wonder if it’s all just a matter of the photo angle. Searching for player stats I’m thinking about the jersey name, \"MARTIN,\" and how it might actually represent \"MARTINELLI.\" Based on the visible letters, it looks like it shows \"MARTINE,\" but since the defender is likely Nick Martinelli, I’m curious about his 3P percentage for the 2023-24 season. It seems I need to check his stats. The previous Proballers page might show information for the 2024-25 season, so I should search for \"Northwestern Wildcats 2023-24 stats\" on their official athletics site to find the correct stats."

        "reasoning_trace": "Identifying teams and players It looks like we’re discussing the Northwestern Wildcats, who are part of the Big Ten. The player might be a guard named \"Martin.\" The jerseys are purple with white stripes. There are a few possibilities, like Johnny Martin, Peyton Martin, or Aaron Martin. The top players seem to be DJ Horne, Boo Buie, and Chase Audige. Since the home team appears to be Maryland, it’s likely a game between Northwestern and the University of Maryland. Identifying players and teams The purple jersey is definitely for Northwestern, and it seems like the defender could be wearing jersey number 2, which confirms the \"Martin 2\" I see on the jersey. I need to verify who #2 is for Northwestern in the 2023-24 season; I suspect it could be Nathan Martin. Northwestern's roster includes several players, but I also consider a former player named Aaron Jones. However, given the colors, it looks like we're indeed discussing Northwestern, not Michigan State or any other team. Analyzing number shape I’m looking at the number \"2\" and seeing how it’s defined by a horizontal line, a diagonal, and then another horizontal one. The image makes it resemble a '7' because of its slant. There’s also a diagonal stroke in the number beneath \"MARTIN\" that starts at the top right and goes to the bottom left, kind of like the diagonal of a '7'. However, the last horizontal line is unclear because it's partially blocked. It's a bit tricky! Clarifying jersey number I’m trying to understand the number in the image. The defender’s extended arm is blocking part of it, but I think the shape looks diagonal, possibly suggesting a \"7\". Now, I'm checking the Northwestern basketball roster to see if they have a player with that number. I see players like Boo Buie and DJ Davis, but I need the official 2023-24 roster to find out who has the last name Martin and what number he wears. I’ll look for that on their official site! Investigating basketball teams I'm searching for \"Northwestern Martin basketball #2\" because the defender's jersey shows \"MARTIN.\" Maybe it's Cedric Martin or Alihan Martin? The matchup might involve Michigan too. I'm noticing that the uniform colors are crucial here. Northwestern has a distinct dark purple, and the font—cursive or block—seems like their style. I realize that the defending team belongs to the Big Ten, but it might not be Northwestern. Kansas State and Rutgers are out, but Michigan State is also a possibility. Analyzing team colors and players I’m piecing together the team colors and jerseys here. Illinois is orange, and Ohio State is scarlet, while Maryland, wearing a white jersey, is hosting Northwestern at Xfinity Center. The ball handler is in Maryland colors, and I think the defending player is from Northwestern. There’s a player with the last name Martin, but neither Northwestern's top players nor freshmen have that name. I need to clarify which player might wear \"MARTIN.\" Other teams, like Minnesota, use maroon, so I’m sticking with the Big Ten context. Identifying the player I’ve confirmed that the dark purple with white trim is indeed Northwestern's color. The defender’s jersey says \"MARTIN,\" and I’m trying to figure out if he’s Carrington Martin or another Martin. There wasn’t a Martin listed in the 2023-24 roster. I think the matchup is Maryland at Northwestern, given the Maryland jersey details. The defender might be wearing #7 based on what I see—but let’s zoom in and check more carefully. I’ll verify the roster to pinpoint who #7 is for Northwestern. Clarifying jersey details I’m returning to the Northwestern men’s cumulative stats page because that’s the authoritative source. It shows stats for players, including a row for #02 Martinelli, Nick. But wait, the jersey shows “MARTIN” instead of “MARTINELLI.” It seems like they’re abbreviating the last name, but they wouldn't typically use just the first six letters. Checking the jersey again, I can see it clearly shows “2,” not “02.” It's a bit confusing, but focusing on those details helps! Analyzing jersey number and name I’m considering that the jersey number could be #2, since it displays just “2” without a leading zero. Officially, Nick Martinelli is #02, but the jersey just shows “2.” However, I see it says \"MARTIN,\" which raises questions. Maybe the “ELLI” part is obscured by the defender's arm, but it looks like I only see \"MARTIN.\" It’s possible they abbreviate long last names, but usually, full names are printed. It's tricky to figure out what's going on! Assessing jersey details for stats I'm analyzing the jersey printing rules, which typically show full last names if they fit. In this case, \"MARTINELLI\" has exactly 10 letters, so it could theoretically fit. However, the image only shows \"MARTIN,\" leading me to think the \"ELLI\" part might be obscured or cropped out. Considering the colors and teams, it has to be Northwestern. The stats page confirms that Nick Martinelli is #02, with a 3P percentage of .271 (27.1%). It's all coming together! Determining 3P percentage and citations I checked the stats source, and it confirms Nick Martinelli's 3-point percentage as .271, which is equivalent to 27.1%. Since the question likely wants it expressed as 27.1%, I'll go with that. But I need to provide citations, as they are important. The stats indicate he's with Northwestern, a Big Ten team, but I can keep it brief and just answer the percentage. Given the context, I’ll look for additional sources, possibly from ESPN or sports-reference, to ensure I cover citation requirements."

I'm seeing names like Boo Buie and Ryan Young, but then there's this jersey that says \"MARTI,\" leading me to wonder if it could relate to someone named Martin. Checking Northwestern's men's basketball roster, I’m not seeing a player with that last name. Wait, could it relate to football? There’s a CJ Martin, but it might not even be Northwestern. There’s also a chance it could be related to Kansas State, but that presents a different team connection. Identifying the player I'm trying to figure out which player is wearing purple from a Big Ten team, and I realize that the only team fitting that description is Northwestern. The defender's jersey has a purple background with white block letters, and it looks like the name \"MARTIN\" is visible above the number, which might be “32.” But oddly, I can't find a Martin on Northwestern's roster. So, I’ll check again to identify which defender this could be and confirm it is indeed a Northwestern Wildcats player. Confirming 3P percentage The ESPN page shows Nick Martinelli's three-point percentage for the 2023-24 season as 27.1%, based on 13 made out of 48 attempts. He has played 34 games with an average of 25.9 minutes and an overall field goal percentage of 49.2%. To answer the user's question clearly, the defender's three-point percentage is indeed 27.1%. I'll cite ESPN as my source: 27.1% (ESPN link). Finalizing the 3P percentage I conclude that the defender's three-point percentage for the 2023-24 season is 27.1%. It's important to express it clearly as \"27.1%.\" I can cite a source to support this, like an ESPN page that confirms this statistic. So to wrap it up, the final answer is 27.1%. This ensures I provide a clear and accurate summary of the information for the user."
