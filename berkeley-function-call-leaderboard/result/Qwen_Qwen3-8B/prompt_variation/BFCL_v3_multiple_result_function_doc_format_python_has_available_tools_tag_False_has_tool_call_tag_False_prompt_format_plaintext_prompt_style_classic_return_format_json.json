The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics functions provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for displacement when there's initial speed, acceleration, and time. The formula is displacement = initial_speed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. That's from the equations of motion. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters here are all provided: initial_speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2 decimal places.\n\nSo I should call the calculate_displacement function with those values. Let me check if all parameters are present. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, and time are all given. No missing parameters. The function doesn't require anything else. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_final_speed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed.

Perfect, that's exactly what's needed here.\n\nThe parameters required are width and length, both integers. The user provided width 7 and length 10, so all the necessary parameters are there. I don't see any missing info. \n\nSo I need to call geometry_rectangle.calculate with width=7 and length=10. No other functions are needed here.

Let me check the parameters for that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. Since it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, which is the default. So I can use the calculate_speed_from_rest function with distance=20 and time=4. The function should compute the final speed.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula that takes into account the quantities and their respective temperatures. The formula is something like (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. But wait, I need to make sure that this formula is correct. \n\nWait, the function provided is calculate_final_temperature, which requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. So the function probably does the calculation based on those parameters. Since the problem gives all four values, I can directly plug them in. \n\nThe user mentioned \"the same gas,\" which is important because it implies that the molar masses are the same and there's no chemical reaction involved, just mixing. So the formula should work here. \n\nSo the parameters are quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. The function should compute the weighted average of the temperatures based on the quantities. Let me check if the function's documentation mentions anything else. The description says it's for mixing different quantities of the same gas, so this should be correct. \n\nNo other functions are needed here.

Since the order is ascending, which is the default, I can call sort_list with elements as the list and order as 'asc'. Wait, but the user said \"ascending order\", so maybe explicitly setting order to 'asc' is better. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The elements are the list, and order is 'asc'.

Let me think about which function to use here. The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, and there's n_rolls and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the problem says \"a roll of two dice\" which typically means standard six-sided dice. So I can assume sides_per_die is 6. \n\nThe desired_sum is 7. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, and sides_per_die=6. But wait, the function's parameters have defaults? Let me check again. The function's Args list shows n_rolls has a default of 1, and sides_per_die is not mentioned as having a default. Wait, in the function definition, the parameters are listed with defaults? Let me check the original function description again.\n\nLooking back: For dice_roll_probability, the Args are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int) with default 1, and sides_per_die (int). So sides_per_die doesn't have a default. Wait, the user didn't specify the number of sides. But in standard dice, it's 6. So I need to include sides_per_die=6. Otherwise, the function might not work correctly. So the parameters should be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. \n\nSo the function call would be dice_roll_probability with those parameters. The user didn't mention anything else, so that's all. I don't need to call any other functions. Let me make sure there's no missing parameters.

The get_population function has a category parameter that includes options like veterans. So I should use get_population. The parameters required are year and category. The year is 1954, and the category is veterans. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, the function's description says it can retrieve population data for categories like veterans.

The parameters given by the user are all there: initial_investment is 20000, rate_of_return is 8% (which is 0.08 as a float), and years is 5. Since contribution is optional and not mentioned, I can leave it out. So the function call should include the three required parameters. I need to make sure the rate is in decimal form.
