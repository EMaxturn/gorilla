There's video_games.on_sale, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which gets the selling price. The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might return a sale price, but the user wants the cheapest, which could be the regular price or a sale price. However, the question is about the cheapest selling price, so maybe store_price gives the regular price, and on_sale might give a discounted price. But the user might be asking for the actual price, not the sale price. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the parameters for store_price, it requires game_title, platform, and region. The region defaults to United States, which is what the user specified. So I can call store_price with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', and region 'United States'. That should get the selling price. But wait, the user said \"cheapest selling price,\" which might be the regular price. However, the function's description says it fetches the selling price, so maybe that's the price they're asking for. Alternatively, if there's a sale, the on_sale function might show that. But the user is asking for the cheapest, so maybe store_price is the correct function here. I'll proceed with that."}

Its parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The user mentioned two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default sides_per_die is 6, which is standard for a die. The desired_sum is 7. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. The function doesn't require n_rolls to be specified since it's optional, but including it makes it clear. The sides_per_die is optional but here it's 6 by default, so maybe it's better to include it explicitly. Wait, the required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. So yes, I need to provide both. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, sides_per_die=6, and n_rolls=2. That should calculate the probability correctly."}

The question is about veterans, which is a demographic category. The get_demographics function's description mentions retrieving demographic data including categories like gender, race, age. Veterans might be under a demographic category. \n\nThe parameters required for get_demographics are year and category. The user provided the year 1954, so that's covered. The category would need to be \"veterans\" or something similar. But I should check if \"veterans\" is a valid category. The description says the category can be things like gender, race, age, so maybe \"veterans\" is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_population function could be used, but population categories include things like total, veterans, women. Wait, the get_population function's category parameters include \"veterans\" as an option. So maybe that's another possibility. \n\nBut the user is specifically asking about veterans, which is a demographic group. The get_demographics function is more directly about demographics, including veterans. However, the get_population function's category could also include veterans. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the number of veterans, which is a specific demographic. The get_demographics function's category could be \"veterans\". But I need to check if the function's parameters allow that. The parameters for get_demographics are year and category. The category is a string, so \"veterans\" would be a valid category. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_population function's category \"veterans\" is available.
