Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe functions provided are store_currency, on_sale, and store_price. The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price in the US, I need to call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. The on_sale function checks if it's on sale, but the question is about the cheapest price, which might involve checking if it's on sale and then the price. However, the user specifically mentions the selling price, so maybe store_price is sufficient. But wait, if the game is on sale, the price would be lower. However, the function store_price might return the current price, which could be the sale price. Alternatively, maybe the on_sale function can confirm if it's on sale, but the user wants the price. So perhaps first check if it's on sale, then get the price. But the user is asking for the cheapest price, which could be the sale price. However, the functions don't have a function to get the lowest price across different regions or sales. So the best approach is to call store_price with the given parameters. The region is specified as United States, so the parameters would be game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform: 'PlayStation', region: 'United States'. That should give the current selling price in the US. The user might be looking for that. So the correct function call is store_price with those parameters."}

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance, time, and initial_speed (which is optional, but since it's starting from rest, initial_speed is 0).\n\nThe user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. The initial speed is zero because it started from rest. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. The other function, calculate_acceleration, would be used if we had initial and final speeds and time, but here we need speed from rest and distance/time.
