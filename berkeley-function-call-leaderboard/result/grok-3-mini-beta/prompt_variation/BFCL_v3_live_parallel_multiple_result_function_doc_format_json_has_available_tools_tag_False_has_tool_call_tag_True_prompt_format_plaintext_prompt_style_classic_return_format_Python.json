Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to map these steps to the available functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This matches step 1. It requires 'repo_url', which is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. Other parameters like destination, recursive, depth are optional.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It requires 'directory_name', which would be the path where the repo is cloned.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It requires 'directory_name'.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It also requires 'directory_name'.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 3 and 4. It requires 'directory_name', and it automatically adds all changes, then commits and pushes.\n\nThe push_git_changes_to_github function says: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, it handles adding, committing, and pushing in one go.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\n1. First, call clone_repo to clone the repository.\n\n2. After cloning, I need to analyze the repo, so call analyse_repo_contents.\n\nThe user says: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following: 2.1 create/update dockerfile based on the analysis. 2.2 kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nThe available functions don't directly take the analysis as input. For example, create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file only require 'directory_name', not the analysis results.\n\nThis might be an issue. The functions like create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file are supposed to generate files based on the directory, presumably using some internal logic, but the description doesn't specify that they use analysis.\n\nIn the system prompt, it says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\nI need to chain them: First clone, then analyze, then create Dockerfile, then create Kubernetes YAML, then push changes.\n\nThe analyse_repo_contents function just analyzes and probably returns results, but in this setup, I think I have to call it, and then use that to inform the next calls. However, since the next functions don't take parameters from the analysis, I might just call them sequentially.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to output all necessary function calls in this response.\n\nPossible function calls in order:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url.\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents with the directory where it was cloned.\n\nFor clone_repo, the default destination is '.', so it clones to the current directory. I need to specify a directory_name for the next functions. Let's assume it clones to '.', so directory_name could be '.' or the repo name.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so it might clone to a directory named 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nTo be precise, I'll use the default and assume directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' or something, but the function parameters describe it as \"The name of the directory where the repository is located.\"\n\nIn clone_repo, I can specify 'destination', but if not, it's '.'.\n\nTo make it clear, I should specify a destination.\n\nThe user didn't specify, so I'll use the default.\n\nFor subsequent functions, I need to provide 'directory_name'. Let's assume it's the repo name without .git, so 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThat might not be accurate, but I have to go with something.\n\nNow, after analyzing, I call create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\nThen, create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\nFinally, push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name.\n\nSo, the sequence:\n\n- First: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n- Second: analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // Assuming the cloned directory is 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- Third: create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n- Fourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // I need to provide parameters like deployment_name, but it has defaults.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has defaults for most parameters, so I can just provide directory_name.\n\n- Fifth: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='something', etc.)\n\nThe user didn't specify commit message, so use default.\n\nI need to put all these in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params), ...]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can list multiple functions in one response.\n\nSince the system says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\", I should output all in this turn.\n\nOne potential issue: Does analyse_repo_contents output something that I need to use? In this setup, I don't think so; I just call the functions sequentially.\n\nAlright, let's list them:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n   - I'll use default for others.\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // Using defaults\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // Using defaults, like commit_message='Update changes'\n\nIs 'nodejs-welcome' the correct directory_name? For clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it might clone to './nodejs-welcome', assuming that's how Git works.\n\nI think that's standard, so I'll go with that.\n\nFinally, format the response."}

I should point out if it's not applicable, but the instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" Since get_relevant_classes and get_signature don't specify the language, I might proceed.\n\nget_imports has languages including Java, so perhaps the repository includes Java code.\n\nTo fulfill the request, I need to make function calls.\n\nIn one response, I can make multiple function calls.\n\nSo, I should call:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True.\n\n2. get_signature for 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\n3. get_signature for 'setCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nI need to format this in the <TOOLCALL> section as specified.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can list them separated by commas or just in sequence inside the brackets.\n\nFrom the example: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I'll do that.\n\nFinally, once I make these calls, if that's all, the system will handle the next steps.\n\nI think that's it for this turn."}

It can also take an optional 'unit' for temperature.\n\n- get_area_of_square: This requires a 'size' parameter, which is the length of one side of the square.\n\nFor the first part: Calculating the area of a square.\n\n- The function get_area_of_square takes a 'size' parameter, which is a float. The user said \"5 cm\", but the function just needs the number, as it doesn't specify units in its description. I can pass 5.0 as the size.\n\nFor the second part: Weather in Queenstown Singapore.\n\n- The function get_current_weather takes a 'location'. The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\", which I can format as 'Queenstown, Singapore' to match the expected format.\n\nSo, both parts can be handled by the available functions.\n\nI need to make function calls in the specified format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should include all necessary calls in one response if possible, as per: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nThe instructions say: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.

Buses_3_FindBus: For searching bus itineraries, not relevant.\n\n2. Buses_3_BuyBusTicket: For buying bus tickets, not relevant.\n\n3. Events_3_FindEvents: This is for finding cultural events like concerts and plays in a specified city. It requires 'event_type' and 'city'. Event_type can be 'Music' or 'Theater'.\n\n4. Events_3_BuyEventTickets: For buying tickets, but the user is just asking to find events, not buy.\n\n5. Hotels_2_BookHouse: For booking houses, not relevant.\n\n6. Hotels_2_SearchHouse: For searching houses, not relevant.\n\nSo, the appropriate function is Events_3_FindEvents.\n\nNow, let's check the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents:\n\n- Required: 'event_type' and 'city'.\n\n- 'event_type': Enum of ['Music', 'Theater']. The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", so I might need to handle both. But the function only takes one event_type at a time. I could call it twice, once for each.\n\n- 'city': Should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', like 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- 'date': Optional, defaults to 'any'. The user specified March 10th, 2023, so I should use that. Format is 'YYYY-MM-DD', so '2023-03-10'.\n\nThe user said \"on March 10th? this year is 2023\", so date is '2023-03-10'.\n\nFor event_type, since the user wants both Music and Theater, I might need to make two calls: one for Music and one for Theater.\n\nThe function description: \"Finds and lists cultural events, such as concerts and plays, that are scheduled to occur in a specified city.\" And event_type is a single value.\n\nIn the parameters, it's a single string, so I probably need to call it separately for each type.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.
