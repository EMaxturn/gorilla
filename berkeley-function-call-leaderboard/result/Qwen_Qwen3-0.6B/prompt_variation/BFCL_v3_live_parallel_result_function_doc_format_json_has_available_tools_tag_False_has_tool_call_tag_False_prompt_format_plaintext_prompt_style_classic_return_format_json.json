But wait, the available function is log_food, which requires food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type, and log_date. \n\nFirst, I need to check if all the parameters are provided. For the mango, the user said 8 pieces. The function needs the portion unit. The user didn't specify the unit, but maybe they assumed something. The function's enum includes 'slice', 'piece', etc. So maybe the unit is 'piece' here. The meal type for mango and tea would be 'snack' as per the default. \n\nFor the pepperoni pizza, two slices. The unit would be 'slice'. The meal type is 'lunch' since it's a snack. The coffee is a snack as well. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention the date or time for each, so the log_date is optional. But since the user didn't provide that, maybe we can leave it as default. \n\nSo, I need to call log_food for each item. Let me structure each function call with the parameters.

Or maybe the user didn't log it? Wait, the user's message says \"I had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea. Earlier I had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\" So the coffee is part of the previous items. But when logging, do we need to log it? The function's parameters don't specify if the amount is logged. The description says \"logs a food item with a given portion size\". So maybe the coffee is logged as well. \n\nSo for the coffee, perhaps the portion is 1, but the user didn't specify. But since the user mentioned they had it, maybe we can assume it's logged.

Let me check again. The user's message says \"I had 8 pieces... and a chai tea. Earlier I had two slices... and a coffee.\" So the coffee is part of the previous items.
