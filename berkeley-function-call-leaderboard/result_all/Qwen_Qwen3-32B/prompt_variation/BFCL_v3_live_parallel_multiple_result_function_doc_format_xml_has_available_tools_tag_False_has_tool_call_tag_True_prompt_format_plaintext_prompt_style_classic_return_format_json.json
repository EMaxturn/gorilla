They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the Caesar salad, ChaFod is the right choice. The parameters needed are foodItem, which is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients or special instructions, so those can be omitted.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function is ChaDri.change_drink. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences need to be a dictionary. The user specified \"large hot coffee\" which probably means size and type. Regular sweetness and almond milk are additional preferences. So new_preferences would include \"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\". \n\nWait, the function's new_preferences is a dict, so I need to structure it properly. The parameters for the drink function require drink_id and new_preferences as a dictionary. So the JSON for the drink call should have drink_id as \"123\" and new_preferences with the specified options.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, which is provided. For the drink, drink_id and new_preferences are required. The user provided both. \n\nSo the function calls should be two separate entries in the tool_call. The first for ChaFod with the food item and removed ingredient, the second for change_drink with the drink ID and preferences."}

The other function, review_of_interviewer, isn't needed here because the user isn't asking for reviews. I should structure the tool calls with each skill. No need for experience level or availability since they aren't specified. So, two tool calls for get_interviewer_list with skill set to Python and Java respectively."}

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is the right choice here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. Since the destination isn't specified, it will clone to the current directory by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo's contents to determine the main language. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory name. Assuming the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be the repo's root, maybe \"nodejs-welcome\". But since the function's parameter is directory_name, I'll use that. Once analyzed, if it's Node.js, the Dockerfile creation function create_a_docker_file should be called with the same directory name. Then, create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs to be called with the same directory name. The other parameters for Kubernetes can be defaulted since they're optional. \n\nAfter creating those files, the changes need to be added to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function will handle adding, committing, and pushing. The directory_name is the same, and I'll need to provide a commit message and branch name if they're specified. Since the user didn't mention specific values, maybe use defaults like \"main\" for the branch and a generic message. But the user might expect the commit message to reflect the changes, so something like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\" would be appropriate. Force push is optional, so default to false unless specified.\n\nWait, the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\" which implies staging all changes. The push function's description says it automatically git adds all changes, so I don't need a separate step for that. Just call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, and branch.\n\nPutting it all together: first clone, then analyze, then create Dockerfile, then create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. Each step depends on the previous one. The analysis result determines the Dockerfile and YAMLs, but since the functions don't require the analysis result as input, just the directory name, I can proceed by calling them in order. The user didn't specify parameters for Kubernetes beyond the directory, so use defaults for the rest. The commit message and branch might need to be inferred, but since they're optional, maybe the user expects defaults. However, the user might want to specify them, but since they aren't provided in the question, perhaps leave them out, but the function requires directory_name. Wait, the push function's parameters: directory_name is required, others are optional. So I can call it with directory_name and a commit message. The branch is optional, so if not provided, it might use the default branch (like main). So the commit message should be provided to describe the changes. The user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is handled by the push function's automatic git add. So the final step is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory and a commit message."}

First, they want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. Second, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nStarting with the first request: finding relevant classes for 'CellResult'. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to true. The search string is 'CellResult', and since they didn't mention case sensitivity, I'll default that to false.\n\nNext, for the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler', the 'get_signature' function is needed.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd available. The parameters required are two non-negative integers. Since 36 and 48 are both non-negative, I can use this function. So I'll need to call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Oh right, 48 is larger than 36, so a should be 48 and b 36. That makes sense.\n\nNow for the second part, the user is asking about the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. Steepness here refers to the derivative of the function at that point. The derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x, so at x=5, it should be 10. But the user might want a numerical estimation using the estimate_derivative function. Let me check the parameters for that function. The function requires a callable mathematical function, the point x, and optionally dx and method. \n\nThe function f(x) = x\u00b2 can be represented as a lambda function in Python, like lambda x: x**2. The point x is 5. The dx and method are optional, but since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default method. The central difference method is commonly used, but if the function doesn't specify a default, maybe I should include a default dx, like 0.0001. However, the parameters for the function don't mention default values. The user hasn't provided dx or method, so maybe I should just include the required parameters. Wait, the function's parameters have 'function' (the mathematical function), 'x', and 'dx' and 'method' as optional. Since the user didn't specify dx or method, I can omit them, and the function might use its own defaults. So the call would be estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. \n\nBut wait, the first parameter is called 'function', which might be a bit confusing because the user's function is also called f(x). But in the parameters, it's expecting a callable, so using a lambda is correct here. \n\nPutting it all together, I need to make two function calls: one to math_gcd with 48 and 36, and another to estimate_derivative with the function x\u00b2, x=5. The user didn't specify dx or method, so those can be omitted. \n\nI should check if all required parameters are present. For math_gcd, both a and b are required, and they are provided. For estimate_derivative, 'function' and 'x' are required, which are also provided. So both function calls are valid."}

The math_gcd function requires two positive integers. The user provided 36 and 48, which are both positive integers. So I can use the math_gcd function here. The parameters would be a=48 and b=36 since the description mentions a is the larger one. Wait, the first parameter is supposed to be the larger one? Let me check the function's parameters again. The description says \"the first and larger positive integer\". So a should be the larger number. 48 is larger than 36, so a=48 and b=36. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, estimating the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The estimate_derivative function is needed here. The parameters required are the function, x, dx (optional), and method (optional). The user specified f(x) = x\u00b2, so the function parameter would be a lambda that takes x and returns x squared. The x value is 5. The dx and method are optional, but the user didn't specify them. The default method is probably forward difference or central difference. Since dx isn't given, maybe use a default small value like 0.0001. However, the function's parameters don't specify default values, so I might need to include dx and method. But the user didn't mention them, so maybe just provide the required parameters. The function parameter is required, so I need to represent f(x) as a lambda. In JSON, how do I represent a lambda? The function's parameter type is \"any\", so perhaps it's a string representation. Wait, the example in the description says \"like the lambda x\", so maybe the user expects a Python-like lambda expression as a string. So the function parameter would be \"lambda x: x**2\". The x is 5. So the parameters would be \"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5. Since dx and method are optional and not provided, I can omit them. \n\nWait, but the user might need to specify dx for accuracy. However, the problem statement doesn't mention it, so I should proceed with the given parameters.

Hmm, maybe I need to make two separate calls, one for music and one for theater. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle a combined type, but according to the parameters, event_type is a single string. The example shows categories like concerts and plays. So perhaps I can use \"music\" for concerts and \"theater\" for plays. Since the user wants either, maybe I should make two function calls. But the user might prefer a single query. Wait, the function's event_type is required, so I have to pick one. But the user is asking for both. Maybe the function can accept multiple types if specified, but the parameter is a single string. The description says \"cultural events, such as concerts and plays\", so maybe the event_type can be a general category. Alternatively, maybe \"music theater\" or similar.

It requires event_type, city, and optionally a date. The user specified \"music event,\" so event_type should be \"concert\" or something similar. The city is New York, NY, and the date is 2023-05-21. I'll use that function first.\n\nNext, they need a direct bus itinerary from Boston, MA to New York on the same date for 2 people. The Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice here. Parameters include from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. Since they want a direct route, the category should be set to \"direct\" or similar. The date is the same, 2023-05-21, and num_passengers is 2. I'll make sure to include those parameters.\n\nI need to check if all required parameters are present. For Events_3_FindEvents, event_type, city, and date are required. The user provided all except event_type, but since it's a music event, I can infer \"concert\" as the type. For the bus search, from_city, to_city, and departure_date are required, which are all provided. Num_passengers is optional but the user mentioned 2 people, so include that. Category is optional but they want direct, so add that.\n\nNo other functions seem necessary here. The user hasn't mentioned flights or hotels, so those can be ignored for now. Make sure the date formats are correct: YYYY-MM-DD for both functions. The event date is 2023-05-21, and the bus departure is the same. All parameters are covered. Now, structure the tool calls accordingly."}

The user wants two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon on 2023-05-10 at 15:00.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider for finding a stylist. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so the city is set. They didn't mention unisex, so maybe we can leave that out or set it to don't care. But the function allows is_unisex to be optional, so I can just provide the city.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is needed. It requires stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided all three: 'Elegant Styles' as the name, 15:00 as time, and 2023-05-10 as date. So that's all set.\n\nWait, do I need to check if 'Elegant Styles' is a valid stylist or salon? Well, the function's description says it can be the name of the salon, so that's okay. The parameters are correct. So I can call both functions. The first one to find providers in Sunnyvale, and the second to book the specific appointment. The user might want to confirm the booking after finding the stylist, but since the booking details are provided, I should execute both requests."}

For Boston, they didn't specify the unit, so maybe default is okay. For San Francisco, they want Fahrenheit. The unit parameter can be set to \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit. \n\nSo I need to call get_current_weather twice: once for Boston, MA without the unit, and once for San Francisco, CA with unit \"imperial\".

The user is asking for all pending and active mandates for users named Parath and Bhanu. Hmm. First, I need to check the available functions. There's user.mandates and partner.mandates.\n\nThe user.mandates function requires a user name and optionally a status. Since the user wants both pending and active, maybe I need to call this function twice for each user, once for each status. Wait, but the status parameter is a single string. So if I want both pending and active, I can't specify both in one call. So for each user, I need two separate calls: one with status \"pending\" and another with \"active\". \n\nWait, the user is asking for two users: Parath and Bhanu. So for each of them, I need to make two function calls. That's four calls in total. But the function parameters require the name and status. Alternatively, maybe the status can take multiple values? But looking at the function definition, the status is a string, not an array. So probably, each call can only fetch one status. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call user.mandates for Parath with status \"pending\", then again with \"active\", then same for Bhanu. But the user might want both statuses combined. However, the function doesn't allow multiple statuses in one call. So yes, four separate calls are needed. \n\nAlternatively, if the status parameter can accept a comma-separated list, but the function's param definition says type is string, so maybe not. The description doesn't mention that. So better to stick with individual calls. \n\nSo the tool calls would be four instances of user.mandates with the respective names and statuses. Let me structure that in JSON as per the required format."}
