To answer the question about what score this individual received for this event, I would need to search for recent Olympic surfing results from Paris 2024. Since today's date is August 22, 2025, the Paris 2024 Olympics would have taken place about a year ago. Let me search for information about Olympic surfing results from Paris 2024."
