Predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant species for the next 100 years using the Darwin model.\n\n3. Calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in poker. They specify: In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible royal flushes, and round to 3 decimal places.\n\nI need to use the available functions to handle these:\n\n- For modifying the painting: Use the \"modify_painting\" function.\n\n  - Parameters: size (required, string, e.g., \"30x40\"), medium (required, string, e.g., \"oil\"), dominant_color (optional, string, e.g., \"red\").\n\n- For predicting the evolutionary rate: Use the \"prediction.evolution\" function.\n\n  - Parameters: species (required, string, e.g., \"African elephant\"), years (required, integer, e.g., 100), model (optional, string, e.g., \"Darwin\").\n\n- For calculating probability: Use the \"calculate_probability\" function.\n\n  - Parameters: total_outcomes (required, integer, e.g., total possible hands in poker), favorable_outcomes (required, integer, e.g., 4 royal flushes), round_to (optional, integer, e.g., 3).\n\nFor the probability calculation, the user says: \"In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\" But to calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in a poker hand, I need the total number of possible poker hands, not just the deck size.\n\nA standard poker hand is 5 cards from 52, so total outcomes should be the number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52, which is C(52,5).\n\nThe function requires \"total_outcomes\" as an integer. So, I need to provide that.\n\nCalculate: C(52,5) = 52! / (5! * (52-5)!) = 2,598,960.\n\nFavorable outcomes: 4 (one for each suit).\n\nRound to 3 decimal places.\n\nI have all the necessary parameters for each function.\n\nThe user asks for the new attributes, the predicted rate, and the probability, but I don't have functions to directly output that; I need to call the functions to get those results.\n\nMy response should only include the function calls in the specified XML format.\n\nI need to make one or more function calls in this turn to complete the tasks.\n\nSo, I should call all three functions in this response since I can handle them now.\n\nOrder: Probably in the order mentioned: first modify_painting, then prediction.evolution, then calculate_probability.\n\nFormat: <functions><function name=\"func_name\">...</function><function name=\"another\">...</function></functions>\n\nEnsure types are correct:\n\n- For modify_painting:\n\n  - size: string, \"30x40\"\n\n  - medium: string, \"oil\"\n\n  - dominant_color: string, \"red\"\n\n- For prediction.evolution:\n\n  - species: string, \"African elephant\"\n\n  - years: integer, 100\n\n  - model: string, \"Darwin\"\n\n- For calculate_probability:\n\n  - total_outcomes: integer, 2598960 (C(52,5))\n\n  - favorable_outcomes: integer, 4\n\n  - round_to: integer, 3\n\nI need to use the exact format.\n\nAfter these calls, I should have fulfilled the request, so no more functions needed in this turn.\n\nResponse should only be the function calls, nothing else."}
