Wait, the function's param description says to separate multiple requests with comma and no space. The user's input has \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space after the comma. Do I need to adjust that? The function's instruction says to use comma with no space between. But the user's request is verbatim. Hmm, but the function's parameter expects the modification_request to be formatted with commas and no space. However, the user's input includes a space. Should I follow the user's exact wording or format it as per the function's requirement?\n\nWait, the function's param says: \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So the modification_request should be formatted with commas and no space. But the user provided \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space. Should I modify it to \"no onions,extra cheese\" when passing to the function? Or is the function able to handle spaces? The function's description says the modification_request is a specific request detailing changes, so maybe the exact wording is important. However, the user said \"verbatim\", so maybe I should pass exactly what they wrote. But the function's parameter expects the comma with no space. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the user says \"modification verbatim: no onions, extra cheese\". So they want the exact text. But the function's parameter requires that if there are multiple requests, they are separated by commas with no space. However, the user's input has a space after the comma. Should I adjust it to fit the function's expected format, or pass it as is? The function's parameter description says to separate with comma and no space, but the user's input has a space. Maybe the function can handle it either way, but to be safe, I should follow the function's instruction. However, the user's request is to use the verbatim text. This is a bit of a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's parameter allows for the user's input as is, even with the space. The function's description says \"specific request detailing the changes\", so perhaps the exact wording is acceptable. The function's parameter might not strictly enforce the comma spacing, but the user's instruction is to use the verbatim text. Therefore, I should pass \"no onions, extra cheese\" as the modification_request. The function may handle it regardless of the space. So the correct call would be change_food with food_item \"burger\" and modification_request \"no onions, extra cheese\"."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city name and an optional date. The city is Foster City, and the date is April 25th, 2023. I need to format the date as 'YYYY-MM-DD', which would be '2023-04-25'. Since the date is provided, I should include it in the function call. The parameters are city (string) and date (string). So I'll call the function with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function. It takes directed_by, genre, and cast as parameters. The user specified the director as James Gray, so I should set directed_by to \"James Gray\". They didn't mention genre or cast, so I can use \"dontcare\" for those parameters to ensure they don't filter out any results. That should retrieve a list of movies directed by him. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted and required fields are met. Since none are required, but the user provided the director, that's all I need. Let me structure the function call accordingly."}

The user didn't mention shuffle or volume, so those can be omitted. Just need to call the function with the correct query."}
