It requires country, species, and years.

This function also requires country, species, and years. Here, the countries are Nepal and Malaysia, species is tiger, and years is 10.

The user wants to use the dataset.csv file to fit a linear regression model where x is data['sales'] and y is data['future_sales'], and also get the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data from the CSV file. The data_loading function can do that. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The file is dataset.csv, so file_path is \"dataset.csv\". The delimiter is defaulting to comma, which should be fine unless specified otherwise. So I'll call data_loading with file_path as \"dataset.csv\".\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the x and y variables. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Assuming that after loading, the data structure has these keys. Then, I'll use the linear_regression_fit function with those x and y arrays. Also, the return_residuals parameter needs to be set to true since the user wants the residuals.\n\nWait, but the functions are in a sequence. First, load the data, then fit the model. So the steps are: call data_loading, then use the resulting data in the linear_regression_fit. But in the function calls, I need to make sure that the output from data_loading is passed correctly. However, the way the functions are structured here, each function call is separate. So first, load the data, then use the x and y from that data. But how does the system handle the data after loading? Maybe the data_loading function returns the data structure, which can then be used to extract x and y for the next function.\n\nSo the first function call is data_loading with file_path \"dataset.csv\". Then, the second function call is linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True. But in the parameters, how is the data passed? The user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], which implies that after loading the data into 'data', those columns are used. So the functions need to be called in order: first load the data, then fit the model using the loaded data's columns.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is to first invoke data_loading, then use the resulting data in the linear_regression_fit. The parameters for linear_regression_fit would be x and y extracted from the loaded data. But in the function calls, how is that represented? The user's instruction is to set x and y as those specific columns, so the parameters for linear_regression_fit would be x and y as lists from the data. However, the system might handle the data loading and passing automatically. So the assistant needs to make two function calls: first to load the data, then to fit the model with the specified parameters, ensuring that return_residuals is True."}

The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures in different museums. The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's get_sculpture_details which requires museum_location and sculpture_id, but the user hasn't provided IDs. Then there's get_artwork_price, which needs museum_location, material, and size. The user provided the materials (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 and 6x3), along with the museum locations (Philadelphia and New York). \n\nWait, but the problem is that each sculpture's price needs to be retrieved individually. So for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price. The first sculpture is in Philadelphia, made of marble, size 4x4. The second is in New York, bronze, 6x3. \n\nBut the function get_artwork_price requires the size as a list. The user provided dimensions as \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to parse those into lists, maybe like [4,4] and [6,3]. But the function's parameters expect sculpture_size as a list. So I can convert those strings into lists of integers. \n\nSo I should make two separate calls to get_artwork_price. Each with their respective parameters. Then, once I have both prices, calculate the average. But since the functions can't compute averages, the user probably expects the system to call the function for each sculpture and then compute the average from the returned prices. However, the current functions only retrieve the price, not compute averages. So the assistant would need to call both functions first, get the prices, then average them. But since the functions can't do that, the answer would require two function calls. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the average of the two prices. So the assistant needs to first get each price individually. So the steps are: call get_artwork_price for the first sculpture, then for the second, then compute the average. But the functions themselves don't compute averages. So the assistant would need to make both function calls first. \n\nSo the correct approach is to make two separate calls to get_artwork_price, each with their respective parameters. Then, once the prices are retrieved, the average can be calculated. But since the functions don't do that, the assistant must call both functions first. \n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\nFirst call: museum_location is Philadelphia, sculpture_material is marble, sculpture_size is [4,4].\n\nSecond call: museum_location is New York, sculpture_material is bronze, sculpture_size is [6,3].\n\nThen, the system would take those two prices and compute the average.
