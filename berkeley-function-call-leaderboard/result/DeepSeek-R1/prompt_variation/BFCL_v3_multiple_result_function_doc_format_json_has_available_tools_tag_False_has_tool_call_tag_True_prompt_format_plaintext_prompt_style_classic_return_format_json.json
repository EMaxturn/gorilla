But the question asks for the price, so we don't need the currency function for this.\n\n2. video_games.on_sale: Checks if a game is on sale. We are asked for the selling price, not whether it's on sale. So this is not directly useful.\n\n3. video_games.store_price: Fetches the selling price of a game in a platform store in a specific region.\n\nThe question asks for the cheapest selling price. Note that the function video_games.store_price returns the current selling price. However, the function does not specify if it returns the base price or the sale price. But the description says \"the selling price\", so we assume it returns the current price (which might be discounted).\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". However, the PlayStation Store typically has one current price. So we don't expect multiple prices? Unless there are different editions? But the function is called for a specific game title. We are given the exact title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'. \n\nWe can use the function video_games.store_price to get the price in the United States for PlayStation.\n\nHowever, note that the function video_games.store_price requires:\n- game_title: string\n- platform: string\n- region: string (optional, default to United States)\n\nWe have:\n- game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n- platform: 'PlayStation' (but note: the platform names in the function examples are like \"PlayStation\", \"Xbox\", \"Nintendo Switch\". So we use \"PlayStation\")\n- region: 'United States' (which is the default, so we can omit if we want, but we can also specify)\n\nBut note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\". Since we are only getting one price (the current selling price for that specific game title on that platform in that region), then that price is the cheapest? Or could there be multiple versions (like standard, deluxe)? The function does not specify an edition. \n\nGiven the function set, we have to assume that the function video_games.store_price returns the price for the base game or the only available version? The description doesn't say. But since the question asks for the game with that exact title, we'll assume the function returns the price of the standard edition or the only edition available.\n\nSo we can call:\n  function: video_games.store_price\n  parameters: \n    game_title: \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\"\n    platform: \"PlayStation\"\n    region: \"United States\"   (we can omit because it's default, but to be explicit we can include)\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". If there are multiple editions, we might need to get multiple prices and compare? However, the function set does not have a way to list editions. So we must assume that the function returns the base price or the only available price.\n\nAlternatively, the function might return the price of the game and if there are multiple editions, we would need to call for each edition? But we don't have a function to get editions. Therefore, we can only get the price for the given title.\n\nSo we will use the function video_games.store_price to get the price.\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". Since we are getting one price, that is the only price? So we return that.\n\nAlternatively, the store might have the same game listed multiple times (like standard, gold, ultimate). How do we get the cheapest? We don't have a function to list editions. Therefore, we must assume that the function video_games.store_price returns the base game price or that the title we are using is the base game.\n\nGiven the constraints, we will call the function for the base game and hope that's what the user wants.\n\nAlternatively, we might note that the function does not specify edition, so we cannot get multiple editions.

But note: the function might require the exact title as in the store. We don't know. We must use what the user provided.\n\nBut wait: the user wrote \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" without the apostrophe? Actually, the user wrote: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' (with an apostrophe? In the question it's written without: \"Assassins\"). In the original question: \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\". Without the apostrophe. So we use \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\".\n\nAlternatively, we might worry that the store uses the correct spelling. But without a function to search for games by approximate name, we must use the provided title.\n\nSo we proceed.\n\nBut note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\". We are only getting one price.

The upcoming month is handled by default.\n\n<TOOLCALL>```json\n[{\"function\": \"find_exhibition\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"New York, NY\", \"art_form\": \"sculpture\", \"user_ratings\": \"high\"}}]\n```</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 766, "output_token_count": 1082, "latency": 58.27921271324158, "reasoning_content": "We are given the task: \"Find the top rated modern sculpture exhibition happening in New York in the upcoming month.\"\n We have a function named 'find_exhibition' that can be used to locate popular exhibitions based on criteria.\n\n The parameters for 'find_exhibition' are:\n   - location (required): string, e.g., \"New York, NY\"\n   - art_form (required): string, e.g., \"sculpture\"\n   - month (optional): string, default returns upcoming events. Since we want \"upcoming month\", we can leave it as default or set to the next month? \n     But note: the description says \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So we can omit it and rely on default.\n   - user_ratings (optional): string enum, default is 'high'. Since we want top rated, we can leave it as default.\n\n However, note the task says \"modern sculpture\". The function does not have a parameter for \"modern\". \n But the description of the function does not specify that we can filter by era (modern). \n We have two options:\n   1. We can try to use the function without the era, and then perhaps filter the results? But the function returns the most popular and we cannot filter by era.\n   2. Alternatively, note that the function uses art_form. We can try to include \"modern\" in the art_form? But the function expects a string for art_form.\n\n Let's see: the art_form parameter is a string. We can try to pass \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form? \n But the function might not understand that. Alternatively, we might have to rely on the fact that the function's backend can handle such queries.\n\n Since the function description does not specify how to handle era, and we are required to use the given functions, we will use:\n   - location: \"New York, NY\"\n   - art_form: \"sculpture\"   (but note: the user said \"modern sculpture\", so we might miss the modern aspect)\n\n However, the function might be designed to accept compound terms? We don't know. But the problem says: if the parameters are lacking, point it out? \n But we are in the middle of a turn and we have to output a function call.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function might return a list of exhibitions and we can then filter by those that are modern? But we cannot do that in one function call.\n\n Considering the constraints, we have to use the function as is. We'll set:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"\n\n And we'll set user_ratings to 'high' (which is the default, so we can omit) and month we omit to get upcoming.\n\n But wait: the task says \"upcoming month\". The function's default is \"upcoming events\", which might include beyond one month? \n However, the task does not specify that we must restrict to exactly one month. So we can rely on the default.\n\n Therefore, we call:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n However, note: the function requires two parameters: location and art_form. We are providing both.\n\n We are not providing 'month' and 'user_ratings', so they will take default values.\n\n But note: the function's description says for 'month': \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" and for user_ratings: \"Default is 'high'\".\n\n So we are good.\n\n However, the task asks for \"top rated\" and \"modern\". We are covering top rated by setting user_ratings to high (by default). \n But modern is not covered. We must note that the function does not have a parameter for era. \n\n Since we cannot specify era, we must hope that the backend returns modern ones? Or we might have to do additional steps? \n But we are only allowed to use the provided functions. \n\n We have to make the call and then perhaps in a subsequent step we can filter? But the system will consider the current turn complete after we output the function call.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function returns the most popular exhibitions. It might be that the most popular ones are modern? We don't know.\n\n Given the constraints, we proceed with the call.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n <TOOLCALL>```json\n [{\"function\": \"find_exhibition\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"New York, NY\", \"art_form\": \"sculpture\"}}]\n ```</TOOLCALL>"}
