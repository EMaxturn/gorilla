They want \"no onions\" and \"extra cheese.\" So, I need to figure out how to handle this request using the functions I have available.\n\nLooking at the list of functions, there's one called \"change_food.\" It seems relevant because it's about modifying food items based on customer requests. The function requires two parameters: \"food_item\" and \"modification_request.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the food item. The user wants a burger, so \"food_item\" should be \"burger.\" That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the \"modification_request\" parameter needs to capture the user's specific requests, which are \"no onions\" and \"extra cheese.\" According to the function's description, if there are multiple requests, I should separate them with commas without any spaces between the comma and the next request. So, I need to make sure I format this correctly.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this. The user said \"no onions, extra cheese,\" so I should pass \"no onions,extra cheese\" as the modification_request. Notice there's no space after the comma, as per the instruction.\n\nSo, putting this together, I need to call the \"change_food\" function with:\n\n- food_item: \"burger\"\n\n- modification_request: \"no onions,extra cheese\"\n\nI should make sure that I don't include any extra spaces or characters that might confuse the function.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function can handle these modifications. For example, does the burger normally come with onions? Can extra cheese be added? But since the function is designed to handle such requests, I'll assume it can manage these modifications appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there are any other parameters I need to consider or if there are any potential conflicts between the modifications. For instance, maybe \"no onions\" and \"extra cheese\" don't interfere with each other, but perhaps there are other constraints I'm not aware of.\n\nGiven that, I think the best course of action is to proceed with calling the \"change_food\" function with the specified parameters.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that if the function cannot fulfill the request for some reason, it should return an appropriate message or indication so that I can inform the user.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to make the function call.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fulfill the user's request to modify their burger order to include \"no onions,extra cheese,\" the `change_food` function should be invoked with the appropriate parameters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Food Item**: The user wants to modify a burger.\n2. **Modification Requests**: The user requests \"no onions\" and \"extra cheese.\" According to the function's requirements, multiple requests should be separated by commas without spaces.\n3. **Format the Parameters**: Ensure the parameters are correctly formatted to meet the function's expectations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"change_food\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"food_item\": \"burger\",\n      \"modification_request\": \"no onions,extra cheese\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Name**: `change_food` is used to modify food items based on customer requests.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `food_item`: Set to \"burger\" as specified by the user.\n  - `modification_request`: Set to \"no onions,extra cheese\" to reflect the user's preferences, adhering to the required format for multiple requests.", "input_token_count": 413, "output_token_count": 723, "latency": 25.454501628875732}

Optional parameters include abv_min, abv_max, ibu_min, ibu_max, and pairings.\n\nIn this case, the user specified:\n\n- Brewery: Creek\n\n- Style: Porter\n\n- Aroma: Rich, chocolatey\n\n- Taste: Slightly bitter\n\n- Color: Dark\n\nI need to map these preferences to the parameters required by the \"find_beer\" function.\n\nFirst, the brewery is specified as \"Creek,\" so I'll set the \"brewery\" parameter to \"Creek.\"\n\nThe style is \"porter,\" so I'll set the \"style\" parameter to \"porter.\"\n\nFor aroma, the user wants a \"rich, chocolatey\" aroma. Since the \"aroma\" parameter in the function expects a string, I can set it to \"chocolatey.\"\n\nSimilarly, for taste, the user wants a \"slightly bitter\" taste. I can set the \"taste\" parameter to \"bitter.\"\n\nFor color, the user wants a \"dark\" color, so I'll set the \"color\" parameter to \"dark.\"\n\nAs for the optional parameters, the user didn't specify any preferences for ABV or IBU, so I can leave those out.\n\nThey also didn't mention any specific food pairings, so I won't include the \"pairings\" parameter.\n\nTherefore, the function call should look like this:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"find_beer\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"brewery\": \"Creek\",\n\n      \"taste\": \"bitter\",\n\n      \"aroma\": \"chocolatey\",\n\n      \"color\": \"dark\",\n\n      \"style\": \"porter\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nI need to make sure that the parameter values match the expected types.

For example, \"Creek\" is likely the name of the brewery, \"bitter\" is a valid taste profile, \"chocolatey\" is a valid aroma, \"dark\" is a valid color, and \"porter\" is a valid style.\n\nIf the function returns a beer that matches these criteria, that should satisfy the user's request.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any potential issues or missing information.\n\nFirst, the user specified that \"all other preferences are standard ones.\" I'm assuming that means they don't have specific requirements for ABV or IBU, so not including those parameters should be fine.\n\nSecond, the user is looking for a porter \"in stock.\" The \"find_beer\" function doesn't seem to have a parameter for availability or stock status.

{"id": "live_simple_131-84-1", "result": "I'm trying to figure out how to generate a RESTful API request on Cisco Nexus Dashboard to get information about an interface. The version is 6.3.1, and the IP address is 192.120.45.67. The API name is \"get information of an interface,\" and there are some parameters: fabricName is Network1, nodeId is 12, podId is 10, interfaceType is Ethernet, and infoType is Speed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly this API does. It seems like it retrieves details about a specific interface on a network device within a fabric. The parameters specify which fabric, which node, which pod, the type of interface, and what kind of information to retrieve, which in this case is the speed.\n\nI need to construct a GET request to this API endpoint. From the function list, there's a function called \"requests.get\" that can send a GET request. It takes a URL and parameters.\n\nSo, I need to build the URL and the parameters correctly.\n\nThe base URL is probably something like https://192.120.45.67/somepath, but I need to know the exact endpoint for getting interface information.\n\nLooking back at the function description, it mentions a URL like 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Maybe that's the endpoint?\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is the correct endpoint for getting interface information. It seems related to telemetry and flow rules, which might not be directly about interface speed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the correct API endpoint for getting interface information. Perhaps there's a better way to construct this URL.\n\nI recall that Cisco Nexus Dashboard uses a specific API structure. For version 6.3.1, there might be documentation available that specifies the endpoints.\n\nAssuming that the endpoint is 'https://{ip}/api/{version}/interfaces', but I'm not sure. I need to verify this.\n\nGiven that, the URL would be 'https://192.120.45.67/api/6.3.1/interfaces'.\n\nBut I also have parameters like fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType.\n\nI need to include these parameters in the request, probably as query parameters.\n\nSo, the URL would look something like:\n\n'https://192.120.45.67/api/6.3.1/interfaces?fabricName=Network1&nodeId=12&podId=10&interfaceType=Ethernet&infoType=Speed'\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Maybe I need to structure the parameters differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the endpoint is 'https://192.120.45.67/api/fabrics/{fabricName}/nodes/{nodeId}/interfaces/{interfaceType}/{interfaceId}'\n\nBut I don't have an interface ID, only the interface type and infoType.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for the API reference for Cisco Nexus Dashboard version 6.3.1.\n\nAssuming that the function \"requests.get\" is available, I need to use it with the correct URL and parameters.\n\nLet me try to construct the URL and parameters based on the information provided.\n\nURL: 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\nParameters:\n\n- fabricName: Network1\n\n- nodeId: 12\n\n- podId: 10\n\n- interfaceType: Ethernet\n\n- infoType: Speed\n\nSo, in the function call, it would be:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"requests.get\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"url\": \"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\",\n\n      \"params\": {\n\n        \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n\n        \"nodeId\": \"12\",\n\n        \"podId\": \"10\",\n\n        \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n\n        \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct endpoint or if these parameters are accurate for this endpoint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parameters need to be included in the URL path instead of as query parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\n'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo/fabricName/Network1/nodeId/12/podId/10/interfaceType/Ethernet/infoType/Speed'\n\nBut that seems cumbersome. Probably, query parameters are the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parameters are part of the JSON body, but since it's a GET request, parameters are usually in the query string, not in the request body.\n\nI think the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"requests.get\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"url\": \"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\",\n\n      \"params\": {\n\n        \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n\n        \"nodeId\": \"12\",\n\n        \"podId\": \"10\",\n\n        \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n\n        \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nBut I have a feeling that the endpoint might not be correct. Maybe I need to find the exact endpoint for getting interface speed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different function or method to use for this purpose.\n\nWait, looking back at the function list, it only provides \"requests.get\". So, I have to use this function.\n\nTherefore, I need to make sure that the URL and parameters are correctly formatted for this specific API.\n\nSince I don't have access to the exact API documentation for Cisco Nexus Dashboard version 6.3.1, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the above function call.\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"requests.get\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"url\": \"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\",\n\n      \"params\": {\n\n        \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n\n        \"nodeId\": \"12\",\n\n        \"podId\": \"10\",\n\n        \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n\n        \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]", "input_token_count": 478, "output_token_count": 1416, "latency": 39.42504119873047}

I have a function called \"get_service_id\" that seems relevant. Let's see what it does.\n\nAccording to the description, \"get_service_id\" retrieves the unique identifier for a specific service within a given province based on the service type and location. That sounds perfect for what I need.\n\nNow, looking at the parameters:\n\n- service_id: required, an integer that represents the type of service. For example, '1' for cleaning, '2' for ironing, and '3' for comprehensive cleaning.\n\n- province_id: optional, an integer representing the province where the service is located, like '1' for Bangkok, '2' for Chiang Mai, etc.\n\n- district_name: optional, a string representing the district name, such as 'Watthana' or 'Thon Buri'.\n\n- rating: optional, a float representing the average review score from 0.0 to 5.0.\n\nGiven that, I need to find a housekeeper who provides ironing services, which should correspond to service_id=2, in Bangkok, which is likely province_id=1, in the Chatuchak district, and with a rating of 4.5 or higher.\n\nSo, I should call the \"get_service_id\" function with these parameters:\n\n- service_id: 2\n\n- province_id: 1\n\n- district_name: \"Chatuchak\"\n\n- rating: 4.5\n\nWait, but the rating parameter is described as the average rating of the service provider's review score, from 0.0 to 5.0, where '4.5' represents a very good rating. Since I need a review score of 4.5 or more, I should set rating to 4.5, assuming that the function will return services with a rating equal to or higher than the specified value.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how the function handles the rating parameter. Does it return services with a rating equal to or higher than the specified value, or exactly equal to it? The description isn't clear on that. Maybe I need to assume that it filters services with a rating greater than or equal to the specified value.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that all the parameters are correctly mapped. Service_id is required, and province_id and district_name are optional, but since I have specific location requirements, I should include them to narrow down the search.\n\nLet me think about whether I need to provide all these parameters. If I omit province_id or district_name, the function might return results from all provinces or districts, which could be too broad. Similarly, without specifying the service_id, I might get all types of services, not just ironing.\n\nSo, to get the most precise results, I should include all the relevant parameters.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the function can handle string inputs for numerical parameters or if I need to ensure that they are integers. The description says province_id is an integer, so I should provide it as an integer, not a string.\n\nSimilarly, rating is a float, so providing it as a float should be fine.\n\nAlso, district_name is a string, so I should provide it as a string.\n\nAssuming that the province_id for Bangkok is 1 and the service_id for ironing is 2, I can proceed with those values.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I might want to confirm the correct province_id for Bangkok and service_id for ironing, but since it's provided in the description, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, the function call should look like this:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"get_service_id\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"service_id\": 2,\n\n      \"province_id\": 1,\n\n      \"district_name\": \"Chatuchak\",\n\n      \"rating\": 4.5\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nThis should retrieve the service IDs for housekeepers in Bangkok's Chatuchak District who provide ironing services and have a review score of 4.5 or higher.\n\nOnce I have these service IDs, I can presumably use them to get more details about each service provider, such as their contact information, availability, and specific services offered.\n\nBut for now, my task is to find these service IDs based on the given criteria.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other parameters or filters that I might need to apply, but based on the information provided, these seem sufficient.\n\nOne more thing: I need to make sure that the function can handle the combination of parameters I'm providing. For example, does specifying both province_id and district_name make sense, or does one override the other? The description suggests that province_id and district_name are both used to specify the location, so likely, they are used together to narrow down the location precisely.\n\nAssuming that's the case, providing both should help in getting the exact location I'm interested in.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to make the function call.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fulfill the user's request, we need to find a housekeeper in Bangkok's Chatuchak District who provides ironing services and has a review score of 4.5 stars or higher. We will use the `get_service_id` function to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Function**: The `get_service_id` function retrieves the unique identifier for a specific service within a given province based on the service type and location.\n2. **Map Parameters**: Map the required and optional parameters to the function call.\n   - `service_id`: 2 (for ironing services)\n   - `province_id`: 1 (for Bangkok)\n   - `district_name`: \"Chatuchak\"\n   - `rating`: 4.5 (to filter service providers with a review score of 4.5 stars or higher)\n3. **Assumptions**: \n   - The function filters services based on the provided parameters.\n   - The `rating` parameter filters service providers with a rating equal to or higher than the specified value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"get_service_id\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"service_id\": 2,\n      \"province_id\": 1,\n      \"district_name\": \"Chatuchak\",\n      \"rating\": 4.5\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Call**: `get_service_id` is called with the specified parameters to retrieve the service IDs of housekeepers in Bangkok's Chatuchak District who provide ironing services and have a review score of 4.5 or higher.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `service_id=2`: Specifies ironing services.\n  - `province_id=1`: Specifies the province as Bangkok.\n  - `district_name=\"Chatuchak\"`: Specifies the district within Bangkok.\n  - `rating=4.5`: Filters service providers with a review score of 4.5 stars or higher.\n  \nThis function call will return the unique identifiers of the service providers meeting all the specified criteria, allowing the user to proceed with selecting a suitable housekeeper.", "input_token_count": 556, "output_token_count": 1486, "latency": 40.53723502159119}

It says 'shuffle' is required=false, so I can omit it.\n\nPerhaps it's better to include it to be explicit, but to keep it simple, I'll omit it.\n\nSo, the function call would be:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"play_spotify_song\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"query\": \"track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nI think that should work.\n\n**Final Output**\n\nTo play the song 'Dil Nu' by Maninder Buttar on Spotify, use the following function call:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"play_spotify_song\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"query\": \"track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\n```\n\n", "input_token_count": 466, "output_token_count": 489, "latency": 15.992705345153809}
