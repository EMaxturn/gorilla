However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current price in the store for that region and platform.\n Since we are only checking one platform (PlayStation) and one region (United States), the price we get will be the only price for that combination.\n However, note that the same game might be available in different editions or bundles? But the function doesn't specify edition, so we assume it returns the base game price.\n\n But wait: the question says \"cheapest selling price\".

According to the description, it fetches the selling price.\n\n So we can simply call `video_games.store_price` for the given game, platform, and region (with region defaulting to US).\n\n Steps:\n 1.

The function doesn't specify an edition. \n The description says: \"The title of the video game\".

Actually, the function parameters are defined as arrays of strings, so the parser should handle it.\n\n Alternatively, we can write exactly as the input: ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] with spaces? \n\n Since the function expects an array of strings, and the representation of the array in the call is just a Python list, we can write it with the spaces for clarity? \n\n However, in the TOOLCALL string, we are writing a string that will be parsed.

We can use \"sculpture\" and note that the exhibition is modern? \n    However, the function doesn't have a parameter for era (like modern). But the description says it returns the most popular exhibitions based on criteria.\n    Since the function doesn't have a parameter for \"modern\", we might rely on the fact that the function returns popular exhibitions and hope that the modern ones are included? \n    Alternatively, we can try to use the art_form as \"modern sculpture\". Let's check the function parameters: art_form is a string. We can try \"modern sculpture\".\n  - Month: the upcoming month. The function parameter 'month' is optional and defaults to upcoming events. So we can leave it out? \n    But note: the function requires two parameters: location and art_form. The others are optional.\n  - User ratings: we want top rated -> so we can set user_ratings to 'high'. The default is 'high', so we can leave it? \n    However, the problem says \"top rated\", so we are safe to leave it as default? But note: the function description says: \"Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\".\n\n Since the function find_exhibition has:\n   required: ['location', 'art_form']\n   optional: month (default to upcoming), user_ratings (default to high)\n\n We can call:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")\n\n But note: the function might not accept \"modern sculpture\" as an art_form? We don't know the exact values. The description says it's a string. \n Alternatively, we can try to use \"sculpture\" and then filter by modern in our mind? But we are only allowed to use the function.\n\n However, the problem says: \"modern sculpture\". We have to represent that. Since there's no separate parameter, we have to put it in art_form.\n\n Let's try: art_form=\"modern sculpture\"\n\n Also note: the function returns the most popular exhibitions (which might be by user ratings and other factors). The user wants top rated -> which we interpret as high user ratings.\n\n So, we can call the function without specifying month (since upcoming is default) and without user_ratings (default high).\n\n Therefore, the function call is:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")\n\n However, note: the function requires two parameters: location and art_form. We are providing both.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"upcoming month\". The function's month parameter is described as: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" \n So we don't need to specify month? It says \"upcoming events\" by default. But note: the user specifically says \"upcoming month\". \n The function's default might return all upcoming events? We don't know. However, without the month parameter, it returns upcoming events. \n Since we are not given a specific month, we can rely on the default.\n\n Therefore, we do not need to specify month.\n\n So, we output:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")\n\n But note: the function returns the most popular exhibitions. We are only asked for the top rated? And we are setting user_ratings to high by default. \n We assume that the function returns the top ones when set to high.\n\n We are not using the other two functions.\n\n So, the tool call:\n<TOOLCALL>find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")</TOOLCALL>"}
