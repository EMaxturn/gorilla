The user wants an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and can wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'uber.ride' and 'uber.ride2'. The first one, 'uber.ride', requires loc, type, and time. The second one, 'uber.ride2', also needs loc, type, and time with a default time of 10. \n\nWait, the user specified a maximum wait time of 10 minutes. The 'uber.ride2' has a default time of 10, so maybe using that would be straightforward. But the user's request mentions 10 minutes, so maybe it's better to explicitly set it. However, the parameters for 'uber.ride2' include time with a default, so maybe it's okay to use that. But the user's request is for 'Plus' type, which is in the enum for both functions. \n\nWait, the 'type' parameter in both functions is an enum with 'plus', 'comfort', 'black'. The user specified 'Plus', so that's valid. \n\nSo, for 'uber.ride', the parameters are loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='plus', time=10. For 'uber.ride2', same parameters. But the user might be using the correct function. However, the problem is that the 'uber.ride2' has a default time of 10, which matches the user's request. So either function can be used. But the user's question is about a ride, so maybe 'uber.ride' is more appropriate. Wait, but the 'uber.ride2' is for weather? Wait, no, the description says 'uber.ride2' is for finding weather at a location. Wait, the description says 'T\u00ecm th\u1eddi ti\u1ebft \u1edf \u0111\u1ecba \u0111i\u1ec3m' which is 'Find weather at the location'. So maybe 'uber.ride2' is not relevant here. The user is asking for a ride, so 'uber.ride' is the correct function. \n\nSo the correct call would be 'uber.ride' with loc, type, and time. The user's time is 10, so time=10. The address is given as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA'. So the function call would be uber.ride(loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='plus', time=10). \n\nBut wait, the 'uber.ride2' has a default time of 10, so maybe using that would be sufficient. However, the user explicitly mentioned 10 minutes, so it's better to include it. But the parameters for 'uber.ride2' include time with a default, so maybe it's okay. However, the user's question is about a ride, so the correct function is 'uber.ride'. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is 'uber.ride' with the given parameters."}

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these details: bank_name is U.S. Bank, account_number is given, account_type is checking, full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview includes total_deposits ($7,132.76), total_withdrawals ($5,927.40), start_date and end_date. The user also provided the starting and ending balances, which are part of the transaction_overview's parameters.\n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView function's parameters include starting_date and ending_date, which the user provided. The account_type is checking, which is one of the enum options. The full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The account_number is given. The transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user's data fits here. So, I can call BankStatementOverView with these parameters. \n\nAdditionally, the user wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and names. The user provided all these except the transactions array. But the transactions array is a list of individual transaction details. However, the user hasn't provided the individual transactions. They only provided the total deposits and withdrawals. So, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the total values and the other parameters, but the transactions array is missing. But the user might not have the individual transactions, so perhaps the summary can be generated using the total values and the other parameters. However, the function requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe we can't call it. But the user might expect a summary even without the individual transactions. However, the function's parameters require the transactions array, which is not provided. So, maybe we can't call that function. But the user might need a summary, so perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the main function to call first, and then the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the total values and the other parameters, even if the transactions array is missing. But the function requires the transactions array. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the BankStatementOverView to include the transaction overview, and then the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the total values. But the function parameters for transaction_summary.generate require the transactions array, which is not provided. So, perhaps the answer is to call BankStatementOverView first, and then note that the transaction_summary.generate can't be called because the transactions array is missing. But the user might need both. However, the user's question includes both an overview and a summary. So, the answer would be to call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, and then mention that the transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the transactions array. But the user might not have that data. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the total values and the other parameters, even if the transactions array is missing. But according to the function's parameters, it's required. So, the answer would be to call BankStatementOverView first, and then note that the transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the transactions array. However, the user might need both, so perhaps the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and then mention that the transaction_summary can't be generated without the individual transactions. But the user's question says \"could you also include a summary of transactions for this period?\" So, the assistant needs to call both functions if possible. But since the transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array, which is not provided, maybe it's not possible. Therefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters, and then note that the transaction_summary can't be generated without the transactions array."}

The user mentioned the employee's ID is Adriel, so I need to use that as the employee_id.\n\nWait, the parameters for get_tech_stack have an employee_id, which is a string. The user didn't provide a specific date, so the as_of_date can be omitted, defaulting to the current date. So the function call should be get_tech_stack with employee_id='Adriel' and include tools if needed. The default for include_tools is False, but the user might want all technologies. However, the parameters don't specify a default for include_tools, so maybe it's better to set it to True to ensure all tools are included. But the user didn't mention tools, so maybe it's okay to leave it as default. Wait, the parameters have include_tools as a boolean with default False. So if the user doesn't specify, it's False. But the question is about the tech stack, which includes tools. So maybe the function will return languages and frameworks, but not tools. But the description says \"including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.\" So maybe the function includes all three. But the parameters have include_tools as a boolean. Since the user didn't specify, we can leave it as default, which is False. But maybe the user wants all, so perhaps we should set include_tools=True. However, the user didn't mention it, so maybe it's better to use the default. But the function's parameters have a default of False for include_tools. So the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id='Adriel'). \n\nWait, the parameters for get_tech_stack are: required employee_id, and include_tools is a boolean with default False. So the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id='Adriel'). The user didn't specify include_tools, so it's False by default. So the function will return the tech stack without tools. But the question is about the tech stack, which includes tools. However, the function's description says it includes all three. So maybe the function will return languages, frameworks, and tools. But the parameters allow specifying whether to include tools. Since the user didn't specify, we can proceed with the default. So the correct function call is get_tech_stack(employee_id='Adriel')."}

The parameters required are category and location. The category should be 'Intermediate' since they mentioned intermediate priced. The location is New York. The user also wants outdoor seating, so the has_seating_outdoors parameter should be set to True. The price_range needs to be 'moderate' as per the default, but the user specified intermediate, so maybe the enum for price_range includes 'intermediate'? Wait, looking at the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the price_range has enum values of cheap, moderate, pricey, ultra high-end.

But maybe the user expects me to assume a default? Or maybe there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to provide the location but forgot. Since the user hasn't given the location, I can't proceed. But the available functions require the location. So the answer would be that the location is missing.

The user specified New York as the location, free entry, and suitable for children.

That should fetch the desired parks."}

The parameters for event_type are in the enum, so maybe the user can choose either. But the user's question is to find events in Las Vegas on March 6th, so perhaps the function needs to be called once with event_type as 'Music' and another call with 'Theater'? Or maybe the function can handle both. But the user might want both types. However, the function's parameters require event_type to be specified. So the correct approach is to call the function twice, once for each event type. But the user's question is to find events, so maybe the function can return both.

Alternatively, the assistant can call the function with event_type='Music' and 'Theater' in the same call? Wait, the parameters for event_type are a single string. So the function can only take one event_type at a time. Therefore, the assistant needs to make two separate calls. But the user's question is to find events, so the assistant should call the function twice. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn.

However, the functions don't have a way to select between options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from the album or any 2019 song. So, the assistant can use Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get the list, then pick one and play it. But the functions don't allow for selecting between options. So, perhaps the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters and then use the result to play one. But the problem is that the user's request is to \"hear a track,\" which might require a function call. \n\nWait, the user's request is to \"hear a track\" which could be either from the album or any 2019 song. So, the assistant needs to make a function call that either plays a track from the album or any 2019 song. But the functions don't have a way to choose between options. So, maybe the assistant should first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the album and year parameters, then use the result to play one of the songs. However, the functions don't have a way to select which song to play. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call Music_3_PlayMedia with a track that's in the album or from 2019. But without knowing which track, it's impossible. So, the assistant might need to first look up the songs and then play one. But the functions don't allow for that. \n\nWait, the user's request is to \"hear a track\" which could be either from the album or any 2019 song. So, the assistant can use Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get the list, then pick one and play it. But the functions don't have a way to select which song to play. So, perhaps the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with those parameters and then use the result to play one. However, the assistant can only make function calls. \n\nSo, the assistant needs to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get the list of songs. Then, the assistant can use that data to play one of them. But since the assistant can only make function calls, maybe the assistant should first call LookupMusic with those parameters and then play one. But the user's request is to \"hear a track,\" which might require a play command. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call Music_3_PlayMedia with a track that's in the album or from 2019. But without knowing which track, it's not possible. So, the assistant needs to first find the songs and then play one. But the functions don't allow for that. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the album and year parameters to get the list of songs, and then use that data to play one. However, the assistant can only make function calls. So, the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters and then proceed to play one of the songs. But since the assistant can only make function calls, the assistant needs to make that call first. \n\nSo, the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019'. Then, the assistant can use the result to play one of the songs. But the assistant can't do that in one function call. Therefore, the assistant needs to make that first call."}

However, they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the genre Hillbilly style. \n\nWait, the Music_3_LookupMusic function can retrieve songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the genre Hillbilly style. So maybe using Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs in that album and genre. But the parameters for LookupMusic include artist, album, genre, and year. The user didn't specify an artist, so the default is 'dontcare', which ignores the artist. The album is \"Gotta Be Me\", and the genre is Hillbilly style. The year is 2019. \n\nSo, I should call Music_3_LookupMusic with album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly style\", year=\"2019\". That would retrieve the songs. Once I have the track names, I can then use Music_3_PlayMedia to play them. But the user hasn't specified which track to play, so maybe the LookupMusic function will return a list, and then I can choose one. However, the user might want to play the first one found. \n\nBut the problem is, the user's request is to \"hear a song\" which could mean playing one. But the functions require parameters. If the user hasn't specified a track, maybe the LookupMusic function will return a list, and then I can call PlayMedia with the first track. However, the user's message doesn't specify a track, so maybe the LookupMusic is the first step. \n\nSo the steps would be: first, use LookupMusic to find songs in the album and genre, then use PlayMedia to play one of them. But the user might not have provided the track name yet. However, the available functions require parameters. Since the user mentioned the album and genre, the LookupMusic function can be called with those parameters. Then, once the tracks are retrieved, the PlayMedia can be called with the track name. \n\nBut the user hasn't specified the track name, so maybe the LookupMusic function will return a list, and then the PlayMedia can be called with the first track in that list. However, the problem is that the user's message doesn't specify the track, so maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic with the given parameters and then PlayMedia with the first result. But the functions need to be called in the current turn. \n\nSo, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly style\", year=\"2019\". Then, once the tracks are retrieved, the next step would be to play one of them using Music_3_PlayMedia. But since the user is asking for a single function call, maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic first. However, the user might expect to play a song immediately. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the question lacks parameters, point it out. The user hasn't specified a track, but the LookupMusic function can be called with the given parameters. So the answer would be to call LookupMusic with the album, genre, and year. Then, once the tracks are found, the PlayMedia can be called with the track name. But since the user hasn't provided the track name, the answer would be to call LookupMusic first. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly style\", year=\"2019\"."}

The Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, and trip_protection. The user specified Portland, OR as the starting city, Seattle, WA as the destination. The date is May 15, 2023. The journey starts one day before, so that would be May 14, 2023. The number of adults is 4, and trip protection is included.\n\nWait, the parameters for the function: the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, which is May 15, 2023. The journey_start_time is one day before, so May 14, 2023. The journey_start_time needs to be in 24-hour format. So 23:00? But the user didn't specify the time, just the date. Maybe the function expects the time, but the user didn't mention it. Hmm, maybe the user just wants the date, but the function requires the time. Wait, the parameters for journey_start_time are in 24-hour format, so maybe the user didn't specify the time, but the function might require it. However, the user didn't mention a specific time, so perhaps we can leave it as default or assume a time. But the user said \"starting at one day before,\" which is the date, but the time is not specified. Maybe the function allows a default time, like 00:00, but the user might need to specify. However, since the user didn't provide the time, maybe we can proceed with the date and assume the time is 00:00. Alternatively, maybe the function allows the date without time, but the parameters require a time. This is a bit confusing. But the user's question is about the journey starting one day before May 15, so the date is May 14, 2023. The time is not specified, so perhaps we can leave it as a default or maybe the function can handle it. But the parameters require journey_start_time as a string in 'HH:MM' format. Since the user didn't specify, maybe we can't proceed without that. Wait, but the user might have intended to specify the time, but it's missing. However, the user's question says \"starting at one day before,\" which is the date, but the time is not given. So maybe the function can accept the date without time, but the parameters require a time. This is a problem. But perhaps the user intended to provide the time, but it's missing. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle the date as the start time. But the parameters require a time. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake, but as per the given info, we have to proceed. Since the user didn't specify the time, maybe we can't include it. But the function requires it. So this is a problem. However, the user might have intended to provide the time, but it's missing. Alternatively, maybe the function allows the date without time, but the parameters require a time. In that case, we can't proceed. But the user's question is to book the tickets, so maybe we can proceed with the date and time as May 14, 2023, 00:00. But the user didn't specify the time. This is a bit of a dilemma. However, since the user's question is about the journey starting one day before, the date is May 14, 2023, and the time is not specified. So perhaps the function can be called with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as May 14, 2023, but the time is not specified. But the parameters require a time. So maybe the user's question is incomplete. However, given the information, I have to proceed. So the function call would be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with _from='Portland, OR', to='Seattle, WA', date_of_journey='2023-05-15', journey_start_time='23:00' (assuming the user meant 11 PM), number_of_adults=4, trip_protection=True. But the user didn't specify the time, so maybe the function can accept the date without time, but the parameters require a time. This is a problem. However, the user might have intended to provide the time, but it's missing. So perhaps the answer is to call the function with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as May 14, 2023, but the time is not specified. Alternatively, maybe the function can be called with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as '00:00' (assuming the user wants the earliest possible time). But this is an assumption. Since the user didn't specify the time, but the function requires it, perhaps the answer is to call the function with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as '00:00', and the number_of_adults as 4, trip_protection as True. So the function call would be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets(_from='Portland, OR', to='Seattle, WA', date_of_journey='2023-05-15', journey_start_time='00:00', number_of_adults=4, trip_protection=True). But the user said \"starting at one day before,\" which is May 14, 2023. So the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is May 14, 2023. But the function requires the journey_start_time in 24-hour format. So maybe the user intended to have the journey start on May 14, 2023, but the date_of_journey is May 15. That's a bit conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the date_of_journey is May 14, 2023, and the journey_start_time is May 14, 2023. But the user said \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before,\" which is May 14. So the date_of_journey is May 15, and the journey_start_time is May 14. But the function requires the journey_start_time to be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' for the date_of_journey. Wait, no, the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, and the journey_start_time is the start time of the journey. So if the journey is on May 15, 2023, starting at one day before, that would be May 14, 2023. So the journey_start_time is May 14, 2023. But the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023. So the function parameters are date_of_journey='2023-05-15', journey_start_time='2023-05-14 23:00' (assuming the user wants the time to be 11 PM). But the function requires the journey_start_time in 'HH:MM' format. So the time would be '23:00'. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\nTrains_1_GetTrainTickets(_from='Portland, OR', to='Seattle, WA', date_of_journey='2023-05-15', journey_start_time='23:00', number_of_adults=4, trip_protection=True)\n\nBut the user didn't specify the time, so this is an assumption. However, the function requires the journey_start_time, so we have to include it. Therefore, the function call is made with the given parameters."}

I don't need to use the other functions because the question is about a specific day's count. Alright, that's the function to call."}

The first one retrieves tokens associated with the user's account, and the second does the same but for custom dashboards. Both require a user_id parameter.\n\nThe user provided their user ID as \"user123\", so I should use either function. However, the get_shareable_api_tokens function is for custom dashboards, which the user didn't mention. Since the question is about general API tokens, the get_api_tokens function is more appropriate. But wait, the parameters for get_api_tokens include 'include_expired' with a default of False. The user didn't specify whether to include expired tokens, so using the default is okay.\n\nSo, the correct function to call is get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\". The other function, get_shareable_api_tokens, isn't necessary here because the user didn't mention custom dashboards. Therefore, I should call get_api_tokens with the provided user ID."}

The parameters needed are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled. The threshold is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. The recipients are an array of emails. The enabled default is True, so maybe it's optional, but the user didn't specify, so including it would be safe.\n\nWait, the parameters for the function: 'threshold' is a float, so 5% is 0.05.

The user is asking for all API tokens now and their user ID is 12345. I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there's the 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' function. Its description says it retrieves a list of API tokens. The parameters include 'include_expired' which defaults to False, 'page' with a default of 1, and 'page_size' defaulting to 20. The user wants all tokens, so maybe I need to adjust the parameters to get every page. Since the default page is 1 and page_size is 20, if there are more tokens than 20, I'll need to call the function multiple times with increasing page numbers. But the user hasn't specified how many pages, so the best approach is to call the function with the default parameters to get the first page and then maybe another call with page=2 if needed. However, the user might not know how many pages there are, so the function should handle that by returning all tokens in the response. Wait, but the function's parameters don't have a way to specify all pages. So maybe the user wants all tokens, so the function should be called with page=1 and page_size=100 (max allowed) to get as many as possible. But the user might not know the exact number. Alternatively, the function might return all tokens in a single call if the page_size is set to a high enough value. But the default page_size is 20, so if the user wants all, maybe we need to call it multiple times. However, the user's request is to \"get all API tokens now,\" so the function should be called with the default parameters to retrieve the first page, and then perhaps another call with page=2 if there are more. But since the user hasn't provided specific parameters, the function call should be made with the default parameters to get the first page. But the user might need to know how to get all, so maybe the function is called once with the default parameters. However, the function's parameters don't have a way to specify all pages, so the assistant might need to call it once with the default parameters and then another call with page=2 if there are more. But since the user is asking for all, the assistant should make sure to retrieve all. But the available functions don't have a way to specify that. So the best approach is to call the function with the default parameters to get the first page and then another call with page=2 if needed. However, the user might not know how many pages there are, so the assistant should make the first call with the default parameters and then check the response to see if more pages are needed. But in the current turn, the assistant needs to make a function call. So the correct function call is to use 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' with the default parameters. The user ID is not required here because the function's parameters don't include a user_id. Wait, looking back at the parameters for 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens', the parameters are 'include_expired', 'page', 'page_size', but no user_id. The user provided their user ID as 12345, but the function doesn't require it. Wait, the first function 'CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens' requires a user_id, but the second function 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' doesn't have a user_id parameter. So the user's user ID is 12345, but the function doesn't need it. So the assistant can call the second function without the user_id parameter. Therefore, the correct function call is to use 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' with the default parameters. The user's user ID is not needed here, so the assistant can proceed. The user wants all tokens, so the function is called with the default parameters to get the first page. The assistant should make that call."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to check which of the available functions can help with that.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's the 'detail_experience_and_education' function. Its description says it retrieves detailed info on experiences and education. The parameters include 'experience_or_education_type' which has an enum value of 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. So that's a match.\n\nThe user specifically mentioned \"education at UNS\", so the 'experience_or_education_type' should be set to that enum value. The 'experience_or_education_name' parameter is optional and has a default of 'Not specified', but since the user is asking for education at UNS, maybe we need to provide the name. However, the default is 'Not specified', but the user is asking for a specific education, so maybe we should set the name to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'.\n\nWait, the parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' require 'experience_or_education_type' and 'experience_or_education_name'. The 'experience_or_education_type' is part of the enum, so if we set that to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', then the name can be omitted or set to a default. But the user is asking for education at UNS, so maybe the 'experience_or_education_name' should be set to the specific name. However, the default for 'experience_or_education_name' is 'Not specified', but the user is asking for a specific education, so perhaps we need to provide the name. But the function's parameters have 'experience_or_education_name' as a string with a default of 'Not specified'. So maybe we can set it to the specific name.\n\nSo the function call would be to 'detail_experience_and_education' with 'experience_or_education_type' set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and 'experience_or_education_name' set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'? Or maybe the 'experience_or_education_type' is the enum value, and the name is optional. But the user is asking for education at UNS, so perhaps the 'experience_or_education_type' is the enum value, and the name is the specific name. But the function's parameters have 'experience_or_education_type' as an enum, so maybe the name is not required. Wait, the parameters are 'experience_or_education_type' (enum) and 'experience_or_education_name' (string, default 'Not specified'). So if the user is asking for education at UNS, then the 'experience_or_education_type' should be 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', and the 'experience_or_education_name' can be left as default, but maybe the user wants the name specified. However, the default is 'Not specified', so maybe the user's query is to get the education at UNS, so the function call would include the type as the enum and the name as the specific name. But the function's parameters allow for both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'experience_or_education_type' is the category, and the 'experience_or_education_name' is the specific name. So if the user is asking for education at UNS, then the 'experience_or_education_type' is 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', and the 'experience_or_education_name' can be left as default. But the user might want the name specified. However, the function's parameters have a default for 'experience_or_education_name', so maybe it's okay to leave it as default. \n\nSo the function call would be to 'detail_experience_and_education' with 'experience_or_education_type' set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and 'experience_or_education_name' as 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'? Or maybe the 'experience_or_education_name' is not required, and the type is sufficient. But the user is asking for education at UNS, so the type should be the enum value. \n\nI think the correct approach is to set 'experience_or_education_type' to the enum value 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and leave 'experience_or_education_name' as default, which is 'Not specified'. But the user is asking for education at UNS, so maybe the name should be specified. However, the function's parameters allow for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'experience_or_education_type' is the category, and the 'experience_or_education_name' is the specific name. So if the user is asking for education at UNS, then the 'experience_or_education_type' is 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', and the 'experience_or_education_name' can be left as default. \n\nIn any case, the function call would be to 'detail_experience_and_education' with the 'experience_or_education_type' set to the enum value. So the parameters would be:\n\nexperience_or_education_type='Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', experience_or_education_name='Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'\n\nBut the default for 'experience_or_education_name' is 'Not specified', so maybe the user's query is to get the education at UNS, so the name is 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'.
