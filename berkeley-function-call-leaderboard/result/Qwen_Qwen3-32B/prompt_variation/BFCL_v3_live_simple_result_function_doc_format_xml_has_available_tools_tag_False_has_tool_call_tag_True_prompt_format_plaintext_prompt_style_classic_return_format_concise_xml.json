So in this case, since the user wants today's movies, and the default is already current date, maybe I can omit the movie_date parameter. Let me check the parameters again. The movie_date is optional, default is current. So the function call would just need city=\"Mumbai\". Wait, but the system note says to consider the movie date as current date in India.

The district_name should be Sankampang, and sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating is 4.5. \n\nWait, the parameters for the function include service_id, province_id, district_name, sub_district_name, and rating. All of these are optional except service_id and province_id. But the user provided all these details, so I can include them. The start and end dates aren't mentioned, so I can skip those. Also, has_late_check_in isn't specified, so I don't need to include that. \n\nSo the function call should have service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name=\"Sankampang\", sub_district_name=\"Ton Pao\", and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the professionals matching the criteria. I need to make sure the types are correct: service_id and province_id are integers, district and subdistrict are strings, and rating is a float. Yes, that's all correct. I think that's all the necessary parameters."}
