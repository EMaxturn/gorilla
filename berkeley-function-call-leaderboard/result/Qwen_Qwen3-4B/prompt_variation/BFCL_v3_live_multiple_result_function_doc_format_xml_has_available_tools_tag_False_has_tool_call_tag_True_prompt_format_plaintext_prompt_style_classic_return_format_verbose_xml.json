The second one has loc, type, and time (optional). The user provided all three parameters: location, type as 'Plus', and time 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the first function's loc parameter requires 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided exactly. The second function's loc is 'City, State', but the user's address includes the street. So the first function is more appropriate here. \n\nSo I should use uber.ride with loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='Plus', time=10. The time is an integer, which matches.

The functions provided are for sending messages, pausing heartbeats, managing memory, and making HTTP requests.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to know Shishir Patil's birthday from some existing data. But according to the functions, there's no function to retrieve personal information. The core memory and archival memory functions allow storing and retrieving data, but the user hasn't provided any prior information about Shishir Patil's birthday. So, I can't retrieve it from memory unless it's already stored.\n\nThe user might be testing if I can use the archival memory to store birthdays.

The account number is given, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and maybe the individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dict. The BankStatementOverView function might require that, but the user hasn't provided individual transactions. However, the user did mention the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals.

Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used to generate the transaction summary, which can then be passed to BankStatementOverView.\n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview that includes a summary of transactions. So perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is the right one, but the transaction_overview parameter is a dict that needs to be filled. Since the user provided the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals, maybe we can construct that dict with those values. However, the function's parameters might require specific keys. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict that's required. The description says it's a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts. So maybe the transaction_overview should include the total deposits, total withdrawals, number of transactions, etc. But the user hasn't provided the number of transactions. However, they did provide the total deposits and withdrawals, starting and ending balances. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used to generate the transaction summary, which would then be passed as the transaction_overview parameter to BankStatementOverView. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe that's not possible. \n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview that includes a summary of transactions. The BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict. The user provided the total deposits, total withdrawals, starting and ending balances. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be constructed with those values. For example, the dict could have keys like 'total_deposits', 'total_withdrawals', 'starting_balance', 'ending_balance', and maybe the number of transactions. But the user hasn't provided the number of transactions. However, the user might not have that info, so maybe we can omit that or assume it's not needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is the right one to generate the transaction summary, which would require the list of transactions, starting and ending dates, total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, and customer info. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So perhaps that function can't be used here. \n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview of the bank statement, which includes the transaction summary. The BankStatementOverView function is the one that provides that. So even if the transaction_overview is a dict that includes the totals, we can use that. The user provided the necessary totals, so we can construct the transaction_overview as a dictionary with those values. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters: bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview as a dict containing the totals provided by the user.\n\nBut the user's question also mentions that there were other deposits and withdrawals, but the total deposits and withdrawals are given. So the transaction_overview would include those totals. \n\nSo the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n\naccount_type: \"checking\"\n\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n\ntransaction_overview: {\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40,\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37\n}\n\nBut the function's transaction_overview is a dict, so that's acceptable. However, the user might need more details in the transaction summary, but since they didn't provide individual transactions, this might be the best we can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to generate the transaction summary, but that requires the list of transactions, which the user hasn't provided. So perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the correct function to use here, with the transaction_overview constructed from the totals provided."}

Alternatively, maybe the assistant should point out that the category is required but not provided.

The pickup time is 10:00 AM, which in 24-hour format is 10:00. \n\nWait, the start_date is April 22, but the end_date is April 27. The function's parameters are start_date and end_date. The user mentioned \"until April 27\", so the end_date should be 2023-04-27. The pickup_time is 10:00 AM, which is 10:00 in 24-hour format. \n\nThe city parameter needs to be in the format 'City, State' with the state abbreviated. Portland, OR is correct. The start_date is 2023-04-22, end_date 2023-04-27. Pickup time is 10:00. The car_type is optional, but the user didn't specify a type, so maybe it's not needed. \n\nSo the function call should include city=\"Portland, OR\", start_date=\"2023-04-22\", pickup_time=\"10:00\", end_date=\"2023-04-27\". The car_type can be omitted since it's not required. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires city, start_date, pickup_time, end_date. All are provided. So the correct function call is RentalCars_3_GetCarsAvailable with those parameters."}

They want to plan a vacation with a roundtrip flight from Atlanta, GA to Boston, MA. The departure is on March 12, 2023, and return a week later. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The user mentioned roundtrip, so the Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights function is the right choice. Let me check the parameters required for that function.\n\nThe parameters needed are origin_airport, destination_airport, departure_date, return_date, and optionally seating_class, number_of_tickets, and airlines. The user provided the departure date as March 12, 2023. The return date is a week later, so that would be March 19, 2023. \n\nThe origin is Atlanta, GA. The function expects the airport code or city name. Atlanta's airport code is ATL, but the user said Atlanta, GA, so either should work. Similarly, Boston's code is BOS, but the user specified Boston, MA. \n\nI need to make sure the dates are in the correct format: YYYY-MM-DD. So departure_date is 2023-03-12 and return_date is 2023-03-19. The user didn't mention seating class, number of tickets, or preferred airlines, so those parameters can be omitted or set to default. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for departure_date and return_date are marked as required for the roundtrip function? Let me check again. The Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights function has departure_date as required? No, looking back, the departure_date is required as false, but return_date is required as false as well. Wait, in the function definition, departure_date is required=\"false\" and return_date is required=\"false\". So the user didn't specify return_date, but they said return a week later. So I need to calculate that. \n\nSo the user's request includes both dates, so I should include both. The origin and destination are provided. So the function call should include origin_airport as Atlanta, GA, destination_airport as Boston, MA, departure_date as 2023-03-12, return_date as 2023-03-19. \n\nI think that's all. The other parameters are optional and not specified, so they can be left out. So the correct function call is Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights with those parameters."}

There's Music_3_LookupMusic, which is for finding songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The user mentioned the album 'The New Classic', so I should include that. They also want tracks from around 2017, so the year parameter should be 2017. The genre isn't specified, so maybe leave that as 'dontcare' unless there's a default.

The artist and genre can be 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify them. \n\nWait, the user says \"similar to those on the album\", which implies they want songs from the same album or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants songs from the same album, but the function might not support that. But the function's description says it finds songs that align with the user's preferences based on artist, album, genre, and year.

There's Hotels_4_SearchHotel which is for searching hotels based on criteria.\n\nThe required parameter is location, which the user provided as Sacramento, California. The function allows optional parameters like star_rating, smoking_allowed, and number_of_rooms.

Sacramento, California is correct as 'Sacramento, CA' but the user wrote 'califronia' which is a typo. Should I correct that? The function's example uses 'New York, NY' or 'Paris, FR', so maybe the user meant 'California' as the state. But the function's parameter description says 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. So the correct format would be 'Sacramento, CA' or 'Sacramento, California' if the country is specified. However, the user wrote 'califronia' which is misspelled. But since the user provided that, maybe I should use 'Sacramento, califronia' as per their input. Wait, but that's incorrect. However, the function might expect the correct state abbreviation. But the user might have made a typo. Hmm, but the function's parameters don't specify that the state must be in abbreviation. The example uses 'NY' and 'FR', so maybe the user should use 'CA' for California. But the user wrote 'califronia' which is a typo. Should I correct it? The problem says if the question lacks parameters, point it out. But here, the user provided the location as Sacramento in califronia. Maybe the function expects 'Sacramento, CA' but the user wrote 'califronia' instead of 'California'. However, the function's parameter description says the location should be in 'City, State' or 'City, Country' format.

Wait, but that's not correct. However, the function might not validate the input. So perhaps I should proceed with the user's input as given, even if it's misspelled. Alternatively, maybe the user meant 'California' as the state. But the function's parameter requires the location in the specified format. So the correct parameter would be 'Sacramento, CA' or 'Sacramento, California'. But the user wrote 'califronia' which is a typo. However, the function's parameters don't specify that the state must be in abbreviation. So maybe the user intended 'Sacramento, California' but wrote 'califronia' instead.

So perhaps the correct location parameter is 'Sacramento, California' but the user wrote 'califronia' instead. However, the function's parameter requires the location in the format 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. So the correct format would be 'Sacramento, CA' or 'Sacramento, California'. But the user's input is 'Sacramento in califronia', which is a typo. But since the function requires the location parameter, I need to use the user's input as given. Wait, but the user might have made a mistake. However, the function's parameters don't validate the input, so I should proceed with the user's input.

However, the function's parameters don't specify that the state must be in abbreviation. So maybe the user intended 'Sacramento, California' but wrote 'califronia' instead. But the function's parameter is required, so I need to use the user's input. Therefore, the location parameter would be 'Sacramento, califronia' but that's incorrect. However, the function might not validate that. So I should proceed with the user's input as given. Alternatively, maybe the user meant 'California' as the state. But the function's parameter requires the location in the format 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. So the correct parameter would be 'Sacramento, CA' or 'Sacramento, California'.

However, the user might have intended 'California' as the state. But since the function's parameters don't validate, I'll proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user meant 'Sacramento, CA' but wrote 'califronia' instead. But the function's parameter requires the location in the specified format. So the correct parameter is 'Sacramento, CA' or 'Sacramento, California'. But the user wrote 'califronia', which is a typo.

Therefore, the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"Hotels_4_SearchHotel\"><param name=\"location\" value=\"Sacramento, califronia\" type=\"string\"/></function>\n\nBut that's incorrect. However, the user's input is as given. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'California' as the state. So the correct parameter is 'Sacramento, California'. But the user wrote 'califronia' instead. But the function's parameters don't validate, so I'll proceed with the user's input. Therefore, the function call is as above. However, the user might have made a typo, but the function's parameters don't require validation. So the answer is to call Hotels_4_SearchHotel with location as 'Sacramento, califronia'."}

The user wants a Comedy-drama movie directed by Kirill Mikhanovsky. I need to check which function can help here. The available functions are Events_3_FindEvents, Events_3_BuyEventTickets, and Movies_3_FindMovies.\n\nThe Movies_3_FindMovies function seems relevant because it's for retrieving movies based on criteria like director, genre, and cast. The user specified the genre as Comedy-drama and the director as Kirill Mikhanovsky. The parameters for Movies_3_FindMovies include directed_by and genre. The director parameter can take a name, and the genre can be specified. The user's request matches these parameters. \n\nSo, I should call Movies_3_FindMovies with directed_by set to \"Kirill Mikhanovsky\" and genre set to \"Comedy-drama\". The cast parameter isn't mentioned, so I can leave it as default or set to 'dontcare'. But since the user didn't mention cast, maybe it's better to omit it or set to 'dontcare' as per the parameter description. However, the function's parameters are optional, so maybe just providing the director and genre is sufficient. \n\nWait, the genre parameter says it must be one of the values in 'enum', but the user is asking for Comedy-drama. I need to check if \"Comedy-drama\" is a valid genre in the enum. Since the function's description says \"must be one of the values in 'enum'\", but the user is specifying a genre, perhaps the function expects specific values. However, the user's input is \"Comedy-drama\", which is a common genre. Maybe the function can accept that. Alternatively, if the enum doesn't include it, the function might not find any movies. But since the user is asking for it, I should proceed with the given genre.\n\nSo the function call would be to Movies_3_FindMovies with directed_by as \"Kirill Mikhanovsky\" and genre as \"Comedy-drama\". The cast parameter can be omitted since it's not specified. Therefore, the correct function call is Movies_3_FindMovies with those two parameters."}

Since the user is asking to find an itinerary, not purchase a ticket yet, the Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Buses_3_FindBus: from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles, and departure_date as March 10th, 2023. The date format needs to be MM/DD/YYYY, so March 10th would be 03/10/2023. The user is traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1.

Alternatively, maybe the function's default is to include metadata. But since the parameters are optional, the function can be called without it. However, the user might not need the metadata. But the function's description says that include_metadata is to specify whether to include metadata. So if the user wants the list, maybe it's better to include it. But the user's question is not clear. However, the function's parameters are optional, so the assistant can choose to include it. Therefore, the correct function call is get_websites with status_filter=\"active\" and include_metadata=True. But the user might not need that. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is to include metadata. But since the parameters are not required, the assistant can choose to include it. So the function call would be get_websites with status_filter=\"active\" and include_metadata=True. That way, the response includes metadata, which might be helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the basic list. But the function's parameters allow for that. So the correct function call is to use get_websites with status_filter set to \"active\"."}

The parameters given are a timeout of 30 seconds, retry count of 5, endpoint URL 'https://api.fdsa-service.com', and it requires authentication.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function can handle adding a service configuration. Looking at the functions provided, the 'add_service_config' function is the one that adds a new service configuration. The parameters required are 'service_name' and 'configurations', which is a dictionary.\n\nThe service name is clearly 'fdsa'. The configurations need to be a dictionary with the keys: timeout, retry_count, endpoint, and authentication. The values would be 30 (integer for timeout), 5 (integer for retry count), the URL as a string, and authentication as a boolean. Wait, the user said it requires authentication, so that should be True.\n\nWait, the function parameters for 'configurations' are a dict. So I need to structure that dictionary correctly. Let me make sure all the parameters are included. The user mentioned timeout (30 seconds), retry count (5), endpoint URL, and authentication required. So the configurations dict should have those four keys.\n\nSo the function call would be add_service_config with service_name 'fdsa' and configurations as the dict with those values.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the get_api_tokens function which retrieves API tokens for a user. It requires the user_id and an optional include_expired parameter. Then there's get_shareable_api_tokens, which is for custom dashboards, but the user didn't mention anything about dashboards. So probably not that one.\n\nThe user's main request is to get their API tokens. The user_id is given as \"user123\", which is a string. The get_api_tokens function takes a string for user_id, so that's good. The include_expired is optional, but since the user is asking to \"remind\" them, maybe they want all tokens, including expired ones? But the user didn't specify, so maybe just call the function without include_expired. Wait, but the default might be to not include expired. However, the user might not know if their tokens are expired. But the function's parameters don't have a default for include_expired, so it's optional. Since the user didn't specify, maybe we should call the function without it, or set include_expired to false. But the function's required parameters are only user_id. So the correct call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, so including expired ones. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the function will return all tokens by default. Wait, the function's description says that include_expired is a flag to determine if expired tokens should be included. So if the user wants all tokens, including expired, they need to set include_expired to true. But the user hasn't mentioned that. However, the user is asking to \"remind\" them of the tokens, which might mean they want all existing tokens, regardless of expiration. But since the parameter is optional, maybe the function without include_expired will return only active tokens. But the user might not know that. However, the user hasn't specified, so the correct approach is to call the function with the user_id and not include the include_expired parameter, as it's optional. Wait, but the function's parameters have include_expired as required=false, so it's optional. So the function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\". The include_expired is not provided, so the API might default to not including expired tokens. But the user might need all tokens, so maybe the assistant should set include_expired to true. But the user hasn't mentioned that. Hmm. The user is asking to \"remind\" them of the tokens, so maybe they want all tokens, including expired ones. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant should call the function without include_expired, and let the API handle it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should include include_expired=True to ensure all tokens are retrieved. But the user might not know about expired tokens. However, the function's parameters don't have a default, so if the user doesn't provide it, the API might not include expired ones. But the user is asking to \"remind\" them, so perhaps they need all tokens. Therefore, the assistant should call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=True. But the user didn't specify that. However, the function's parameters allow for that. So maybe the correct call is to use get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=True. But the user hasn't mentioned anything about expired tokens. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should just call the function without include_expired, and let the API return the tokens as per default. But the user might not know if the tokens are expired. However, the user is asking to \"remind\" them, so they might need all tokens. Therefore, the assistant should include include_expired=True. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant should make that assumption. Alternatively, the assistant should call the function without include_expired, and the user can check if they need to include expired ones. But the user is asking to \"remind\" them, so maybe the assistant should include include_expired=True. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for get_api_tokens have include_expired as required=false. So the assistant can choose to include it or not. Since the user is asking to \"remind\" them of all tokens, perhaps the assistant should include include_expired=True to get all tokens. But the user might not know that. However, the assistant's job is to make the best possible call. So the correct function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=True. But the user didn't specify that. However, the assistant can't know that. So maybe the assistant should call the function without include_expired, and the user can decide if they need to include expired tokens. But the user is asking to \"remind\" them, so maybe they want all tokens.

The functions available are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application\", the create_global_application_alert_config is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (string, required), alert_type (string, required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (boolean, optional). \n\nThe user provided the name, threshold as 5%, which is a float (0.05?), but maybe they meant 5.0. The recipients are two emails. The alert_type isn't specified, but the threshold is for error rate. Maybe the alert_type should be 'error_rate'? But the user didn't mention it. Wait, the function requires alert_type. The user didn't specify, but the threshold is for error rate. Maybe I need to infer the alert_type based on the threshold. However, the function requires it, so perhaps the user expects me to use 'error_rate' as the alert_type. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is something else. But since the user mentioned error rate, I'll go with that.\n\nSo parameters would be name: 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type: 'error_rate', threshold: 5.0 (as a float), recipients: ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], and enabled is optional. The user didn't mention enabling it, so maybe leave it as default (probably false). But the function's enabled is optional, so maybe it's okay to omit it. Wait, the function's parameters say enabled is required? No, in the function definition, enabled is required=\"false\". So it's optional. So the function call would include name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The user didn't specify enabled, so we can leave it out. But maybe the default is true? Or maybe the user wants it enabled. Wait, the question says \"set up a new configuration\", which might mean creating it but not necessarily enabling it. But the enable function is separate. So perhaps the user just wants to create the config, and maybe it's enabled by default. But the function's enabled parameter is optional. So the function call would include the required parameters and omit enabled if not provided.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with name, alert_type (error_rate?), threshold 5.0, recipients as the array of emails. The alert_type might need to be specified. The user didn't mention it, but the threshold is for error rate. So I think the alert_type should be 'error_rate' here. So that's the function call."}

Wait, the function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Hmm, maybe that's not the right function.\n\nLooking at the other function: api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. This one also retrieves API tokens for the user. The parameters are include_expired (boolean), page (integer), and page_size (integer). The user wants all tokens, so maybe we need to fetch all pages. But the user didn't specify page or page_size. The default page is 1, and page_size is probably 100. But since the user says \"all,\" maybe we need to handle pagination. However, the user might not know about pagination, so perhaps the system should retrieve all tokens in one call if possible. But the function's parameters don't have a way to get all tokens at once. So maybe the user needs to be informed that they have to handle pagination, but since the user is asking for all, maybe the function can be called with page=1 and page_size=100, and then check if more pages are needed. However, the user might not have provided the necessary parameters. Wait, the user provided the user ID, but the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter. Wait, the functions are for the user's account, so maybe the user ID is not a parameter here. Wait, the user's user ID is 12345, but the functions might be using the user's credentials or session. Wait, the functions are part of the API, so maybe the user ID is not a parameter for these functions. Wait, looking back at the functions:\n\nThe get_api_tokens function is under api_token_api.APITokenApi. The parameters are include_expired, page, page_size. The user ID is not a parameter here. But the user provided their user ID as 12345. How does that fit in? Maybe the user is authenticated, and the user ID is part of the authentication context. But the functions don't take a user_id parameter. So perhaps the user is authenticated, and the functions are retrieving the tokens for the current user. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the user is expecting to use that. However, the functions don't have a user_id parameter. So maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the user ID in the context of the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function, which does require a user_id. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So perhaps the correct function is the APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, but the user's user ID is not a parameter here. So maybe the user's user ID is not needed for this function. But the user provided it, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi function, which requires the user_id. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So perhaps the user is confused between the two functions. \n\nWait, the user says \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". The user is probably referring to all API tokens associated with their account. The APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function is for retrieving API tokens, but the user ID is not a parameter here. So maybe the user is authenticated, and the function is retrieving the tokens for the current user. But the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary for the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. However, that function is for shareable tokens, not all tokens. \n\nSo the correct function to use here is APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The user's user ID is 12345, but that's not a parameter for this function. Therefore, maybe the user is authenticated, and the function is retrieving the tokens for the current user. But the user provided the user ID, so perhaps the user is expecting to pass it. However, the function doesn't take a user_id parameter. Therefore, maybe the user is mistaken, or the functions are designed in a way that the user ID is part of the authentication context. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function, which requires the user_id. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So perhaps the user is confused. \n\nIn this case, the user is asking for all API tokens, so the correct function is APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The user provided their user ID, but that's not a parameter for this function. Therefore, the function call would be to get_api_tokens with the parameters include_expired set to true (to include expired tokens), and maybe page=1 and page_size=100. But the user didn't specify those parameters. However, the user wants all tokens, so maybe the function should be called with page=1 and page_size=100, and then check if more pages are needed. But the user might not know about pagination. \n\nAlternatively, the user might not have provided the necessary parameters for the function. But the function doesn't require them. So the function can be called with default parameters. However, the user might need to handle multiple pages. But the user is asking for all tokens now. \n\nSo the correct function call is to APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, page=1, page_size=100. But the user didn't specify those, so maybe the function is called with the default page and page_size. However, the default page_size is 100, which is the maximum allowed. So the function call would be get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user might want all tokens, so including expired ones. \n\nAlternatively, the user might not have specified include_expired, so the function can be called without it. But the user is asking for all tokens, so including expired ones. Therefore, the function call should include include_expired=True. \n\nSo the correct function call is to APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. The user's user ID is 12345, but that's not a parameter for this function. Therefore, the function call is made without it. \n\nBut the user provided the user ID, so maybe the user is expecting that the function uses it. However, the function doesn't take it. Therefore, the user might be confused. But based on the given functions, the correct function to call is APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function, which requires the user_id. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So that function might not be the right one. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. The user's user ID is 12345, but that's not a parameter for this function. So the function call is made without it. \n\nSo the final answer is to call APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True."}
