The get_news_report function can retrieve news based on location, category, and language. The parameters require the location in 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country' format.

The user wants me to clone a repository, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repo using the provided URL. The function clone_repo requires repo_url and destination. The URL is given as git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination isn't specified, so I'll default it to the current directory.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents with analyse_repo_contents. The directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' since that's the cloned repo's name. This will determine the main programming language, which is probably Node.js here.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile using create_a_docker_file. The directory name is 'nodejs-welcome'. Since it's a Node.js project, the Dockerfile should include steps for installing Node modules, etc. But the function just creates the Dockerfile, so I'll call it with the directory name.\n\nAfter that, generate Kubernetes YAMLs with create_kubernetes_yaml_file. The directory name is 'nodejs-welcome'. The deployment name could be 'nodejs-welcome-deployment', image name might be 'nodejs-welcome', replicas 2, port 3000 (common for Node apps), service type ClusterIP. But the user didn't specify these, so I'll use defaults where possible, maybe adjust the image name based on the repo name.\n\nThen, add all changes to git using push_git_changes_to_github. The directory is 'nodejs-welcome', commit message should be something like 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs', branch 'main', no force push.\n\nWait, but the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is part of the push function. So the push function handles adding, committing, and pushing. So I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, branch, and force_push as default.\n\nI need to make sure all functions are called in order: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. Each function call should be in the correct sequence. The parameters for create_kubernetes_yaml_file might need some assumptions since the user didn't specify deployment name, image name, etc. But the function has defaults, so maybe it's okay. Let me check the parameters again. The directory_name is required, deployment_name is optional, image_name defaults to 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type ClusterIP. Since the repo is Node.js, maybe the port is 3000. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps use default port 80. Alternatively, maybe the analysis would suggest the port, but the function doesn't take that into account. Hmm, but the user's step 2.2 says to create Kubernetes yamls based on analysis. However, the function create_kubernetes_yaml_file doesn't use the analysis result; it just takes parameters. So maybe the user expects that the analysis informs the parameters, but since the functions don't pass that info, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the image name is based on the repo name, like 'nodejs-welcome', and deployment name as 'nodejs-welcome-deployment'. But the function parameters don't have a way to get that from the analysis. So perhaps the user expects that the assistant will use the analysis result to set those parameters, but since the functions don't have that capability, I have to proceed with the given parameters. Maybe the user expects that the assistant will use the directory name as part of the deployment name. So I'll proceed with the directory name as part of the deployment name, image name as 'nodejs-welcome', replicas 1, port 80, service type ClusterIP. Alternatively, maybe the default values are acceptable. The user might not have specified, so using defaults is okay.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name, maybe deployment_name as 'nodejs-welcome-deployment', image_name 'nodejs-welcome', replicas 1, port 80, service_type ClusterIP.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, commit message, branch, force_push.\n\nBut the user didn't specify some parameters, so I have to use defaults where possible. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file's deployment_name is optional, so if not provided, it might default to the directory name. But the function's default for deployment_name is 'deployment' or something? Wait, looking back: the function create_kubernetes_yaml_file's parameters have deployment_name as a str with default 'deployment'? Wait, the function's args say deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided. Wait, the default is not specified in the args, but in the function description. Wait, the function's args for create_kubernetes_yaml_file are:\n\nArgs:\n    directory_name (str): The name of the directory where the repo is located. This will be used to name the Kubernetes deployment and service.\n    deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n    image_name (str, default='latest'): ...\n    replicas (int, default=1): ...\n    port (int, default=80): ...\n    service_type (str, default='ClusterIP'): ...\n\nWait, the description says that directory_name is used to name the deployment and service. So if deployment_name is not provided, maybe it uses the directory name. But the function's parameters have deployment_name as a required parameter? Wait, looking at the function definition:\n\ndef create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name, deployment_name, image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP'):\n\nBut in the args, deployment_name is a str, but the default is not specified. Wait, the user's function description says \"deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\" So maybe the default is the directory name? Or is deployment_name required? The function's args don't have a default for deployment_name, but the description says to use defaults if not provided. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the user's instruction says to create Kubernetes yamls based on the analysis. Since the analysis might determine the deployment name, but the function doesn't take that into account, perhaps the assistant should use the directory name as the deployment name. So in the function call, set deployment_name to directory_name, which is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo the function call would be create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='nodejs-welcome', replicas=1, port=3000, service_type='ClusterIP'). Wait, but the user didn't specify the port. However, for a Node.js app, the default port is often 3000. But the function's default is 80. Maybe the assistant should adjust that. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps it's better to use the default of 80, or maybe the analysis would suggest it. But the function doesn't use the analysis result. This is a bit of a problem. But given the functions available, the assistant has to proceed with the parameters as per the user's instructions, even if some are guessed.\n\nIn any case, the assistant needs to make the function calls as per the steps. So the order is:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo contents.\n3. Create Dockerfile based on analysis.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs based on analysis.\n5. Push changes.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='.'),\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='nodejs-welcome', replicas=1, port=3000, service_type='ClusterIP'),\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs', branch_name='main')\n\nBut the user didn't specify the deployment name, image name, port, etc. However, the function requires these parameters. Since the user's step 2.2 says to create Kubernetes yamls based on the analysis, but the function doesn't take the analysis result into account, the assistant has to make assumptions. So perhaps the deployment name is the same as the directory name, image name is the repo name, port is 3000, etc.\n\nTherefore, the function calls are as above."}

The first is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The second is to get the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure proper overriding.\n\nStarting with the first request: finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are the search string, case sensitivity, and whether to include subdirectories. The user specified 'CellResult' as the search term and wants subdirectories included. So, I'll set search_string to 'CellResult', include_subdirectories to True, and case_sensitive to False unless specified otherwise. The function call would be get_relevant_classes with those parameters.\n\nNext, for the method signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function is the right choice here. Each method requires the class name, method name, and whether to include private methods.

So, I'll call get_signature twice: once for each method, with class_name as 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name as each respective method, and include_private as False. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly provided.

So proceed to call both functions.\n\nSo first, call Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex default. Then call Services_1_BookAppointment with the given parameters."}
