There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for changing drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I'll set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The newIngredients should be \"Caesar salad\" and the specialInstructions might be \"without anchovies\". \n\nThen, for the drink order 123, the user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id, new_preferences, and special_instructions. The drink_id is 123. The preferences include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", and milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions can be left empty since they didn't mention any additional info.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The foodItem is a string, newIngredients is a comma-separated list, etc. The drink parameters are all strings as required. No missing parameters here. So, two function calls: one for food and another for drink."}

The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name, which I'll use. Similarly, create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name.

The 'get_relevant_classes' function seems relevant for finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True. The search string here would be 'CellResult' since they want classes related to it. Case sensitivity is default, so maybe leave it as is.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function requires 'class_name', 'method_name', and 'include_private'. The 'AbstractCellHandler' class is the parent, so the method names would be 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', but the functions provided don't have a method named 'getNumericValue'. So maybe the user is referring to a method in 'CellResult' that's not present. But the functions available don't include a method for that. However, the user is asking to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get the signatures of the overridden methods.

The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned a side of 5 cm, so I need to convert that into a float. Since 5 cm is 0.05 meters, but the function expects a float, maybe the input is already in cm. Wait, the function's parameter is a float, so I can just pass 5.0. So the call would be get_area_of_square(size=5.0).\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a 'location' parameter. The user specified Queenstown Singapore, so I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, but the default is fahrenheit, so I can leave it out or set it if needed.
