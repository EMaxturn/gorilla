The user is asking for an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc (string), type (string), and time (integer). The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. All required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2, its description says it's for finding weather at a location, which doesn't seem relevant here. Also, the parameters for ride2 require loc in 'City, State' format, but the user provided a full street address. Plus, the type parameter in ride2 is required, but the function's purpose is about weather, so that might be a mistake in the function setup. Since the user is asking for a ride, not weather, uber.ride is the correct choice.\n\nSo, the correct function to call is uber.ride with the given parameters. The loc is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type is 'Plus', and time is 10. All required parameters are met, so the function call should work."}

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include searching in recall memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user's question is about a person's birthday, it's possible that information might be in the core memory's 'human' section or in the archival memory. \n\nI should start by checking the core memory. The core_memory_search function isn't available, but the recall_memory_search can look through conversation history. Wait, the user hasn't provided any prior conversation history here, so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to know public information. But since I can't access external data, I need to use the functions provided.\n\nIf the birthday isn't in core memory, I might need to search archival memory. But the user hasn't provided any prior archival data. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the http_request function to look up Shishir Patil's birthday online. Let me check the functions again.\n\nYes, there's an http_request function. I can make a GET request to a search engine or a public database. Let me try that. The method would be GET, and the URL could be something like \"https://api.example.com/search?q=Shishir Patil birthday\". But I need to make sure the URL is correct. Wait, the user might not have provided API access, but maybe I can use a general search. However, without knowing the exact API, this might not work. But the function allows me to make the request, so I'll proceed.\n\nOnce I get the birthday from the HTTP response, I can then use send_message to congratulate him. But I need to structure the function calls properly. First, make the HTTP request, then process the response to get the birthday, then send the message. Since the HTTP request is asynchronous, I might need to request a heartbeat to continue after the response is received.\n\nWait, the http_request function has a 'request_heartbeat' parameter which is required. So after making the request, I should set that to true so that a heartbeat is triggered, allowing me to process the response in the next turn. Then, in the next step, I can use the response data to send the message.\n\nSo the steps are: 1. Use http_request to fetch Shishir Patil's birthday. 2. Upon receiving the response, parse the birthday. 3. Use send_message to send the congratulation message with the birthday.\n\nBut I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. For the http_request, method is GET, url is appropriate. Let me structure the function call now."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the October 2019 statement period. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The BankStatementOverView function seems necessary because it provides an overview with account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided the bank name (U.S. Bank), account number, account type (business checking), and full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING). The transaction overview needs to be a dict with totals and counts. \n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview is a required parameter for BankStatementOverView. How do I get that? The user mentioned there are transactions, but they didn't list them. However, they did provide total deposits, withdrawals, and the start/end balances. Maybe the transaction_overview can be constructed using the TotalTransactions.calculate function. That function calculates the total transactions and balances. The parameters needed are starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, and ending_balance. The user provided all these values except the dates in ISO format. The dates given are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. I need to convert those to ISO format. Starting date would be 2019-10-01T00:00:00Z and ending date 2019-10-31T23:59:59Z. \n\nOnce I have the TotalTransactions.calculate result, that might give me the transaction overview needed for BankStatementOverView. Then, I can call BankStatementOverView with the provided account details and the transaction overview from the TotalTransactions.\n\nWait, but the user also asked for a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function might be needed here. It requires transactions array, dates, totals, and customer names. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the transactions array isn't available. But the user might expect a summary based on the totals. However, the transaction_summary.generate function requires individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, maybe that function can't be used. Alternatively, maybe the Alltransactions function could retrieve them, but the user didn't mention needing individual transactions, just a summary. \n\nAlternatively, the transaction_summary.generate might use the totals provided. Wait, looking at the parameters for transaction_summary.generate, it requires transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. So without that, we can't use that function. The user might have to rely on the BankStatementOverView which includes a transaction overview with totals. \n\nSo the plan is: first, use TotalTransactions.calculate to get the transaction overview, then use that result in BankStatementOverView. \n\nLet me check the parameters again. TotalTransactions.calculate needs starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance. The user provided all these except the dates in the correct format. So I need to format the dates. \n\nOnce TotalTransactions is called, it returns something that can be used as the transaction_overview parameter in BankStatementOverView. \n\nSo the first function call is TotalTransactions.calculate with the given parameters. Then, the second function is BankStatementOverView with the account details and the transaction overview from the first call. \n\nI need to make sure the dates are in ISO 8601 format. The user's dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So starting_date is '2019-10-01T00:00:00Z' and ending_date is '2019-10-31T23:59:59Z'. \n\nTotal deposits: $7,132.76, total withdrawals: $5,927.40, starting balance $5,532.01, ending $6,737.37. \n\nSo the first function call is TotalTransactions.calculate with those values. Then, the transaction_overview would be the result of that, which includes the totals and counts. \n\nThen, BankStatementOverView is called with bank_name 'U.S. Bank', account_number '1-523-1713-5704', account_type 'checking' (since it's a business checking account), full_name 'SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING', and transaction_overview from the TotalTransactions result. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. The user didn't provide individual transactions, so the transaction_summary.generate can't be used because it requires the transactions array. Therefore, the BankStatementOverView with the overview from TotalTransactions should suffice for the summary."}

{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. It requires category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate price, which I can map to a price range. The location is New York, but the function expects 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and state is NY, I'll use 'New York, NY'. They also want outdoor seating, so set has_seating_outdoors to true. The category isn't specified, but it's a required parameter. Hmm, maybe the user didn't mention it, so I should leave it out? Wait, no, the function requires 'category' as mandatory. The user didn't provide that, so I might need to ask for clarification. But the user's question doesn't mention a category. Wait, maybe the category can be left as a default or omitted? No, the function requires it. So this is a problem. The user hasn't provided the cuisine type. But maybe the function allows it to be optional? Let me check the parameters again. No, the category is required. So I need to inform the user that the category is missing. But the user hasn't provided it. Wait, the user's query is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Since category is required, perhaps I can't proceed without it. But the user didn't specify a category. So maybe the function call can't be made as is. Wait, but maybe the category can be left blank? No, the function requires it. So the correct approach is to point out that the category is missing. But the user hasn't provided that info. So the assistant should note that the category is required but not provided. However, looking back, the user's original question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category is a required parameter, so the function can't be called without it. Therefore, the assistant should indicate that the category is missing. But the user might not know what category they want. Alternatively, maybe the category can be omitted, but the function requires it. So the correct response is to point out that the category is required but not provided. However, the user's question doesn't mention the category. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. But the user might expect the system to find any restaurant in that price range with outdoor seating. Since the function requires category, the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the correct action is to inform the user that the category is required. However, the user hasn't provided it. So in the function call, the category is missing. Wait, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't make the call. So the answer should be that the category is missing. But the user's question doesn't have it. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the category is required but not provided. However, the user might not know what category they want. So perhaps the assistant should ask for the category. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. But in the given functions, the Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function's category is required. So the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the answer is that the category is missing. However, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating.

The parameters required are the city and an optional boolean for unisex. \n\nThe user mentioned \"unisex,\" so the is_unisex parameter should be set to true. The city is Pleasanton, but the function expects a city with state abbreviation. However, the user didn't specify the state. Pleasanton is in California, so the city parameter should be \"Pleasanton, CA\". \n\nSince the user didn't mention the state, but it's required for the function, I need to assume the correct state abbreviation. Since Pleasanton is a city in California, adding \"CA\" makes sense. Therefore, the function call should use Services_1_FindProvider with city as \"Pleasanton, CA\" and is_unisex as true."}

Since the user is asking to search for a hotel, not reserve yet, the correct function is Hotels_4_SearchHotel.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Hotels_4_SearchHotel: location is required. The user specified Sydney, Australia, so location should be \"Sydney, AU\". Star rating is 4, so star_rating is \"4\". Smoking allowed is a boolean, and the user wants smoking allowed, so smoking_allowed is true. Number of rooms is mentioned as two, but the parameter description says it can be a positive integer or 'dontcare'. So number_of_rooms should be \"2\".\n\nWait, the number_of_rooms in the function is for reserving, but the user is searching. However, the function's param for number_of_rooms is optional and can be used to specify the number of rooms they want to reserve. But the user's question says \"has two rooms available\". Hmm, does the search function allow specifying available rooms? The description says \"the number of hotel rooms to reserve\", not available. So maybe the user is looking for hotels that have at least two rooms available. But the function might not support filtering by available rooms. The parameter is for how many they want to reserve, not the availability. So maybe the user just wants to reserve two rooms once found. So in the search, we can set number_of_rooms to \"2\" to indicate they want to reserve two, but the availability is handled in the reserve function.

But the user is trying to send money, not request it. So probably MakePayment is the right one here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for MakePayment: payment_method, amount, receiver, and private_visibility.

The parameters include album and year. The user specified the album as \"Narrated For You\" and the year as 2022. \n\nThe function's parameters for album and year are both optional but can be specified. The year parameter expects a string, so \"2022\" is correct. The album name should be exactly as given.

Wait, the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic have artist, album, genre, year. The user didn't mention artist or genre, so those can be left out or set to 'dontcare'. The function allows using 'dontcare' when preference isn't specified. \n\nTherefore, the correct parameters would be album=\"Narrated For You\", year=\"2022\", and artist and genre set to 'dontcare'. But looking at the function's param definitions, the required fields are none, so all are optional. So including album and year, and leaving others as default. Wait, the function's parameters have required=\"false\" for all, so I can just specify the album and year. The artist and genre parameters can be omitted, but the function might default to 'dontcare' if not provided. Wait, the description says for artist: \"Use 'dontcare' if artist preference is not specified.\" So maybe if we don't include them, it's equivalent to 'dontcare'? Or do we need to explicitly set them? The function's parameters don't have a default value specified in the XML, but the description implies that using 'dontcare' is the way to indicate no preference. Therefore, to be safe, I should include artist=\"dontcare\" and genre=\"dontcare\" in the parameters. But the user's query doesn't mention artist or genre, so maybe it's better to omit them? Wait, the function's parameters for artist, album, genre, year are all optional. If we don't include artist and genre, the function might not filter by them. However, according to the description, if you want to indicate no preference, you use 'dontcare'. Therefore, to ensure that the search only filters by album and year, and ignores artist and genre, we should set artist and genre to 'dontcare'. \n\nSo the final function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album=\"Narrated For You\", year=\"2022\", and artist=\"dontcare\", genre=\"dontcare\". But the user didn't specify artist or genre, so maybe it's better to leave them out. Wait, but if we leave them out, the function might not know to ignore those parameters. The description says \"Use 'dontcare' if artist preference is not specified.\" So to explicitly tell the function to not filter by artist or genre, we need to set them to 'dontcare'. Therefore, the correct parameters are artist=\"dontcare\", album=\"Narrated For You\", genre=\"dontcare\", year=\"2022\". \n\nYes, that makes sense.

However, the function might require a single type. If the user wants either, perhaps I should make two separate calls, but the function might handle it if \"concert\" or \"play\" is specified. Since the user mentioned both, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" first. Alternatively, maybe the system allows a list, but the parameter is a string. Hmm. The function's event_type is a string, so I might need to choose one. But the user is open to either.

Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"music\" or \"cultural\", but the description says \"category of the cultural event\".

The user provided all these: where_to is Austin, TX, number_of_adults is 4, check_in is 05/12/2023, check_out is 05/18/2023. So maybe they can proceed to book directly. But maybe they need to search first to find available houses. However, the user didn't mention any specific criteria like laundry service, rating, etc. So perhaps they just want to book based on the given dates and number of adults. \n\nWait, the BookHouse function requires those four parameters, and the user provided all. So maybe the correct step is to call Hotels_2_BookHouse with those parameters. But sometimes, booking requires first searching to get the house details. However, according to the function descriptions, SearchHouse is for searching based on criteria, and BookHouse is for booking a selected house. Since the user hasn't mentioned selecting a specific house, maybe they need to search first. But the user's message is to book, so perhaps they assume a house is already selected. \n\nHmm. The user might not have searched yet, so maybe the assistant should first call SearchHouse to find available options. But the user's instruction is to book. However, without searching, the system might not know which house to book. So the correct process would be to first search for available houses with the given parameters, then book. But the user hasn't specified any additional search criteria like laundry service or rating. So the SearchHouse function can be called with where_to, and number_of_adults. But the user's main goal is to book, so maybe the assistant should proceed to book directly if the parameters are sufficient. \n\nWait, the BookHouse function requires check_in and check_out dates, which the user provided. So the assistant can call BookHouse with the given parameters. However, in real scenarios, booking usually requires selecting from available options, so maybe the user needs to search first. But the user's message is a direct request to book. Since the parameters for BookHouse are all provided, the assistant can proceed to call that function. \n\nSo the correct function call is Hotels_2_BookHouse with where_to as \"Austin, TX\", number_of_adults as 4, check_in_date as 05/12/2023, check_out_date as 05/18/2023."}

But the journey_start_time is supposed to be on the date_of_journey. This is confusing. Perhaps the user made a mistake and meant the journey starts on May 15th. Let's assume that. So the journey_start_time would be a time on May 15th, but the user says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the start time is 12:00 AM (midnight) on May 15th, which is technically one day after May 14th.

But the user said \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the start time is 24 hours before the journey date. But the journey_start_time is supposed to be on the date_of_journey. This is a problem. The user's request might have an error here. However, since the function requires journey_start_time, I'll have to make an assumption. Maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 15th at a specific time, but mistakenly said \"one day before\". Alternatively, perhaps the journey_start_time is the time on May 15th, and the \"one day before\" refers to something else.

The include_metadata is optional, but the user didn't mention needing metadata like creation dates, so maybe I can leave that out. \n\nAlternatively, if I need more details about each website, maybe I should first get the list with status_filter=\"active\" and then use get_website for each ID to get their configurations. But the user just asked for \"all actively configured websites\", which might be covered by get_websites with status_filter=\"active\". \n\nWait, the get_websites function's description says it retrieves a list of websites with their settings and metadata. If the user wants configurations, maybe after getting the list, I need to fetch each website's config. But the user's request is for \"all actively configured\", which could mean they just need the list of active ones. Let me start with get_websites and set status_filter to \"active\". If that's insufficient, the next step would be to call get_website for each ID returned. But since the user hasn't specified needing more details, maybe the first step is enough. \n\nSo the first function call should be get_websites with status_filter=\"active\".

The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application alert configuration,\" the create_global_application_alert_config function is the right choice here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (string, required), alert_type (string, required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (boolean, optional). The user provided the name, threshold (5% which is 0.05 as a float), and recipients. But they didn't specify the alert_type. However, since it's an error rate, the alert_type is probably something like 'error_rate' or similar. I'll have to assume that based on context.\n\nSo, the parameters would be:\n- name: 'UrgentAlert77f7'\n- alert_type: 'error_rate' (inferred)\n- threshold: 0.05 (since 5% is 0.05 as a float)\n- recipients: ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']\n- enabled: not specified, so maybe default to false or omit.

Since the function requires it, I have to include it. So I'll set alert_type to 'error_rate'.\n\nPutting it all together, the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The enabled parameter isn't required, so it's optional. The user didn't mention enabling it, so maybe it's better to leave it out or set to false. Since the function's enabled is optional and not required, we can omit it. So the final parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients."}

The description says it retrieves shareable API tokens. The user didn't specify shareable, but maybe that's the right one. Also, there's api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens which doesn't take a user_id but has other parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. \n\nWait, the user provided their user ID, so maybe the first function is the right one. The second function's get_api_tokens doesn't have a user_id parameter, so perhaps it's for the current user? But the user specified their user ID, so maybe the first function is intended here. \n\nThe user wants all tokens, so for CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, the required parameter is user_id, which is provided. The include_revoked is optional. Since the user says \"all\", maybe we should set include_revoked to true. But the user didn't mention revoked tokens, so maybe just the default. \n\nAlternatively, the second function's get_api_tokens might return all tokens for the user, but since it doesn't take a user_id, maybe it's for the authenticated user. If the user is authenticated, maybe that's the way. But the user provided their user ID, so perhaps the first function is needed. \n\nHmm, there's also the post_api_token function, but that's for creating a new token, which the user isn't asking for. \n\nSo the user wants to retrieve all their existing tokens. The user ID is 12345. The first function requires user_id, so I should call CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345. The include_revoked is optional, but since the user wants all, maybe include it as true. But the user didn't specify if they want revoked ones. Maybe just call it without include_revoked, which by default might not include them. But the user said \"all\", so perhaps setting include_revoked=true is better. However, the function's description says \"shareable\" API tokens. The user might be asking for all tokens, not just shareable ones. \n\nWait, the second function, get_api_tokens, might return all tokens for the current user. But since it doesn't take a user_id, maybe it's for the user making the request. If the user is authenticated, then calling get_api_tokens would get their tokens. But the user provided their user ID, which suggests they might not be authenticated or need to specify it. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's user ID is 12345. The first function requires user_id, so that's a match. The second function doesn't take user_id, so maybe it's for the current user. If the user is the one making the request, then maybe get_api_tokens would work. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe they need to specify it. However, the second function doesn't have a user_id parameter. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to use is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345. The include_revoked can be set to true to ensure all tokens are included. But the user didn't mention revoked, so maybe leave it out. The default might be false, so the user might not get revoked tokens. But they said \"all\", so perhaps include_revoked should be true. \n\nSo the function call would be get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=true."}
