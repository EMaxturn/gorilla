The user needs an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum list (plus, comfort, black). The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So all required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2. The parameters required are loc and type. The loc here needs to be in the format 'City, State', but the user provided a full street address. Also, uber.ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, which matches. However, the loc format doesn't fit because it's a street address, not just city and state. So uber.ride2 might not be the right choice here because the loc parameter is supposed to be 'City, State' like 'Berkeley, CA', but the user gave a full address. \n\nWait, the user's address is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' which includes the street, city, and state. The uber.ride function's loc parameter allows that format, while uber.ride2's loc is only 'City, State'. Therefore, the correct function to use is uber.ride because it accepts the full address. \n\nSo the parameters would be loc: '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type: 'plus', time: 10. \n\nI should make sure that the function name is correct and the parameters are properly formatted. Also, check if the time is an integer. Since the user said 10 minutes, that's an integer. All required parameters are met for uber.ride. Therefore, the correct function call is uber.ride with those parameters."}

Hmm, but the function might still handle it. The default is EN, but maybe the search can still return Korean results if the keyword is in Korean. Not sure, but the user didn't specify language, so maybe stick with default. But the user's query is in Korean, so perhaps they want results in Korean.

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include http_request, which can make a web request. Maybe I can search the web for his birthday. Let me check if there's a function that can do that. The http_request function allows sending a GET request to a search engine. Let me form a query like \"Shishir Patil birthday\" and use that in the URL.\n\nOnce I get the birthday from the web, I can use send_message to send the congratulation. But wait, the user might not have provided his contact details. The send_message function requires a recipient, which defaults to 'default@example.com'. But the user hasn't specified that. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to know his contact info, but since I don't have it in the core memory, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to send the message to Shishir Patil directly, but without his contact info, I can't. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to send a congratulation message. So first, I need to find the birthday via http_request, then use send_message with the recipient as Shishir Patil's contact. But since I don't have his contact, maybe the user expects me to use the default, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to inform them of the birthday and ask for the contact. But the user's instruction is to send the message, so I need to proceed with the available functions.\n\nSo first, use http_request to search for Shishir Patil's birthday. Then, once I have that info, use send_message with the message as the congratulation. But the recipient parameter is required. Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe I should send it to the default, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the human's info from core memory. Wait, the core memory's human section might have the user's contact, but the user is asking to send to Shishir Patil. So perhaps the user's request is incomplete. But I have to proceed with the functions available.\n\nSo first, make the http_request to find the birthday. Then, once I have that, send the message. But the recipient is missing. Maybe the user expects me to send it to the default, but that's not Shishir. Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to inform them of the birthday and then they can send the message. But the user's instruction is to send it. Hmm. Well, according to the problem, if parameters are missing, I should point it out. But the user's question is to send a message to Shishir, so the recipient is required. Since I don't have that info, I need to inform the user. But the user's instruction is to use the functions. Wait, maybe the user expects me to use the http_request to find his contact as well. But that's not part of the current question. The user's question is to find the birthday and send a message. So perhaps the steps are: 1. Find birthday via http_request. 2. Send message to Shishir using send_message, but since recipient is missing, I can't. Therefore, the correct approach is to first perform the http_request to get the birthday, then perhaps the user can provide the contact info, but since the user hasn't, maybe the function call is incomplete. But according to the problem, if parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user's instruction is to send the message, so maybe I should proceed with the http_request first, then in the next step, the user can provide the contact. But in the current turn, I can only make the http_request to find the birthday. Then, once I have that, I can ask for the contact info. But the user's instruction is to send the message, so perhaps the assistant should first get the birthday, then send the message with the default recipient, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the http_request to find both birthday and contact, but that's not feasible. \n\nSo the correct function calls would be first to make the http_request to find the birthday. Then, once that's retrieved, use send_message with the message and the recipient as Shishir's contact. But since the recipient is not provided, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should first make the http_request to find the birthday, then perhaps the user can provide the contact info. But according to the problem's instructions, if parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, in this case, the assistant is supposed to use the functions. So the first step is to perform the http_request to find the birthday. Then, once that's done, the assistant can send the message, but without the recipient, it's not possible. Therefore, the assistant should first make the http_request, then in the next step, the user can provide the contact info. But the user's current instruction is to send the message, so the assistant needs to proceed as much as possible. \n\nSo the first function call is http_request to search for Shishir Patil's birthday. Then, once the birthday is known, the assistant can send the message, but the recipient is missing. Therefore, the assistant should make the http_request first, then in the next turn, the user can provide the contact info. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make the function calls in the current turn. So the correct answer is to first make the http_request to find the birthday, then send the message once the birthday is known. However, the recipient is missing, so the assistant can't send the message yet. Therefore, the assistant should first make the http_request to get the birthday, then in the next step, the user can provide the contact info. But the user's instruction is to send the message, so the assistant needs to proceed. \n\nIn conclusion, the first step is to use http_request to find the birthday. Then, once that's retrieved, the assistant can send the message, but the recipient is missing. Therefore, the assistant should first make the http_request, then in the next step, the user can provide the contact info. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make the function calls in the current turn. So the correct function call is the http_request to find the birthday.

It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, the account number, the account type is checking, the full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. For the transaction_overview, they need total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned $7,132.76 in deposits and $5,927.40 in withdrawals. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So that fits into the transaction_overview.\n\nThen, the user also wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just the totals. So maybe we can't use that function unless we have the list of transactions. However, the user might expect a summary based on the totals provided. But the function requires individual transactions. Hmm. The user might not have provided the individual transactions, so maybe we can't generate that part. Alternatively, maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve the transactions for the period. The Alltransactions function needs the statement_period and include_pending. The statement period here is October 2019, so '2019-10'. If we call Alltransactions with that period, we can get the list of transactions, then use that in the transaction_summary.generate. But the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the assistant needs to first retrieve them. However, in the current setup, the user is asking to include a summary, so perhaps the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019, then use that data in the transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, maybe the assistant can't proceed. Wait, the user is asking the assistant to provide the overview and summary, so maybe the assistant is supposed to use the data the user provided. But the transaction_summary.generate requires individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, maybe the assistant can't generate that part. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the totals and other info to create a summary without individual transactions. But according to the function's parameters, the transactions array is required. So without that, the function can't be called. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that the transaction summary can't be generated without the individual transactions. However, the user might expect that the assistant can use the totals and other data to create a summary. But according to the functions provided, the transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the assistant can't call that function. Therefore, the assistant can call BankStatementOverView with the provided data and note that the transaction summary can't be generated without individual transactions. But the user is asking to include a summary, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the BankStatementOverView and then mention that the transaction summary requires more data. However, the instructions say to make function calls if possible. So the first step is to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. Then, if the user wants the transaction summary, they might need to provide the individual transactions. But since the user hasn't provided them, the assistant can't call the transaction_summary.generate function. Therefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the provided data."}

Since the user specified \"today\" and Noida, I need to set city to Noida and movie_date to today's date. The system note says to default the movie date to the current date, which is November 4, 2024, so I should format that as '04-Nov-2024' or similar. Wait, the parameters for get_movies expect movie_date in 'DD-MM-YYYY' format. So today's date would be '04-11-2024'. The user didn't mention language or format, so those can be set to their defaults, which are Hindi and 2D. Cinema_hall isn't specified, so leave it as default (None).

The default is already 'moderate', so maybe that's covered. But I should explicitly set it to ensure. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. New York is a city, so maybe 'New York, NY' is correct.

Wait, the user didn't specify a cuisine type, so maybe I need to pick a general category? But looking at the enum for category, there's 'American' or 'California' but nothing like 'general'. Hmm. Wait, the user didn't specify a category, so maybe the function allows it to be optional? Wait, no, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' and 'location' as required. So the user hasn't provided a category. But the function requires it. How to handle that? Maybe the user is okay with any category as long as it meets the other criteria. But the function requires a category. So perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Maybe use a common category like 'American' or leave it as a default? Wait, the function's parameters don't have a default for category. So the user's request lacks the 'category' parameter. But the function requires it. So maybe the user didn't specify, but the function can't be called without it. However, the user might not care about the category. But since it's required, perhaps the assistant should proceed with a general category or ask for clarification. Since the user hasn't provided it, but the function requires it, maybe the assistant has to make a choice. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave it out, so perhaps the assistant can select a default category. But the function doesn't have a default. Hmm. Wait, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating in New York. They didn't specify the cuisine. So maybe the assistant can choose a general category, but looking at the enum, there's 'American' which might be a safe bet. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a different approach. Wait, perhaps the assistant can call the function with a category that's a common choice, but since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant should proceed with a placeholder. However, the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant has to make an assumption here. Let's proceed with 'American' as the category. So the parameters would be category: 'American', location: 'New York, NY', price_range: 'moderate', has_seating_outdoors: True. That should cover the user's requirements.

First, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are Payment_1_RequestPayment and Payment_1_MakePayment.\n\nThe RequestPayment function is for initiating a payment request, which might be asking the receiver to send money, but the user wants to send money themselves. The MakePayment function is for sending money, which fits the user's request. \n\nLooking at the parameters for MakePayment: payment_method, amount, receiver, and private_visibility. The user specified \"debit card\" as the payment method, the amount is $154, the receiver is the landlord's email, and they want it private. \n\nThe amount in the function is in USD, and the user mentioned $154, so that's straightforward. The private_visibility should be set to True for a private transaction. The receiver's email needs to be provided as a string.\n\nSo, I should call Payment_1_MakePayment with payment_method 'debit card', amount 154.0, receiver as the landlord's email (assuming the email is provided as the receiver identifier), and private_visibility True. Wait, the user didn't specify the landlord's email address. Oh, right, the user just mentioned \"landlord's email\" but didn't give the actual email. Hmm, but the function requires the receiver parameter. If the user hasn't provided the actual email address, maybe that's a problem. But maybe in the system, the receiver can be identified by some internal identifier, but the user is referring to it as the email. Since the function's receiver parameter is a string, perhaps the email is acceptable here. \n\nAssuming the user has the landlord's email as the receiver identifier, I'll proceed. If not, the function call would fail, but based on the information given, we have to proceed with what's available. So the parameters would be:\n\npayment_method: 'debit card'\namount: 154.0\nreceiver: 'landlord@example.com' (but the user didn't specify the actual email. Wait, the user just said \"landlord's email\" but didn't provide the email address. Oh, that's a problem. The function requires the receiver parameter, which is a string like an email or account number. Since the user didn't provide the actual email address, maybe this is missing. But the user might expect that the system already knows the landlord's email. However, in the given question, the user hasn't provided the email address. So this is a missing parameter. But the user might have intended that the receiver is known, or maybe it's a placeholder. Since the problem says to point out if parameters are missing, but the user's instruction is to make the function call if possible. Since the user didn't provide the actual email, perhaps the function can't be called. Wait, but the user might have provided the receiver as \"landlord's email\", but the function requires a specific identifier. So maybe the receiver parameter is missing. However, in the user's message, they said \"to my landlord's email\", so maybe the receiver is the email address of the landlord, which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, the function call can't be made because the receiver parameter is missing. But the user might have intended that the receiver is known in the system. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. \n\nWait, the user's question is: \"Could you initiate a private payment from my debit card to my landlord's email for $154?\" So the receiver is the landlord's email. But the user hasn't provided the actual email address. So the receiver parameter is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called because the required parameter 'receiver' is not provided. However, maybe the system assumes that the user has the necessary information, and the receiver is provided as the email. But in the given input, the user hasn't given the email address. Therefore, the function call is missing the 'receiver' parameter. \n\nBut the user might have intended that the receiver is known, like a saved contact. However, the function's parameters require the receiver to be specified. Since the user hasn't provided the actual email address, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the receiver parameter is missing. However, the initial instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the user's message says \"to my landlord's email\", which implies that the email is known. Maybe in the context of the application, the user has already provided the landlord's email in a previous step, but in this case, the user hasn't. \n\nGiven that, the function call can't be made because the receiver is not provided. However, the user might have made a mistake. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, we should point it out. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls if possible, else point out the missing parameters. Since the user hasn't provided the actual email address, the receiver parameter is missing. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the receiver is missing. But the user might have intended that the receiver is the landlord's email, but the email isn't specified. \n\nWait, but the user's message is a hypothetical scenario. Maybe in this case, we should proceed with the information given, assuming that the receiver is provided as the email. For example, if the user says \"to my landlord's email\", perhaps the email is considered as the receiver. But since the user hasn't provided the actual email address, we can't fill in the parameter. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nBut the problem says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the specified JSON format if possible. Since the receiver is a required parameter and it's not provided, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the receiver is missing. However, the user might have intended that the receiver is known, but in the given input, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the receiver is the landlord's email, and the email is considered as the receiver parameter. For example, if the user says \"to my landlord's email\", perhaps the receiver is the email address, but the user hasn't provided the actual email. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters for Payment_1_MakePayment are payment_method, amount, and receiver. The user provided payment_method (debit card), amount ($154), and mentioned the receiver as the landlord's email, but didn't provide the actual email address. Therefore, the receiver parameter is missing. Hence, the function can't be called. However, the user might have intended that the receiver is known, but according to the problem's instructions, we need to point out missing parameters. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the receiver is missing. But the user's question is in a hypothetical scenario where perhaps the receiver is known. \n\nWait, but the user's message is a direct request. If the user says \"to my landlord's email\", perhaps in the system, the landlord's email is already stored, and the receiver can be referenced by a known identifier. However, the function's parameters require a string like an email or account number. If the system allows referencing contacts by their email, then the receiver parameter would be the email address. Since the user hasn't provided the actual email, the function can't be called. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the receiver parameter is missing. However, the user might have intended that the receiver is the landlord's email, but the email isn't specified. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to make the function call if possible. Since the user hasn't provided the receiver's email, the function can't be called. Therefore, the response should indicate that the receiver is missing. However, the problem says to return the function calls if possible, else point out the missing parameters. Since the user hasn't provided the receiver, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the receiver is missing. \n\nBut the user's message is a request to initiate a payment, and they mentioned \"landlord's email\", which implies that the email is known. Maybe in the context of the application, the user has already provided the landlord's email in a previous step, and the system can reference it. However, in this scenario, the user hasn't provided the email address. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters are missing, so the function can't be called. However, the user might have intended that the receiver is the landlord's email, but the email isn't provided. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the receiver parameter is missing. But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, we should point it out. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the specified JSON format if possible. Since the receiver is missing, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the receiver is missing. \n\nBut the user's message is a hypothetical, and perhaps the assistant is supposed to proceed with the information given.

The event_type can be 'Music' or 'Theater', which matches the user's request. The city is New York, so I'll format it as 'New York, NY'. The date is March 10th, which should be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so '2023-03-10'.

The function doesn't require any other parameters, so I don't need to use defaults for optional ones. \n\nWait, the date parameter in the function has a default of 'dontcare', but the user specified March 10th. So I should set date to '2023-03-10'. The event_type can be either 'Music' or 'Theater', but the user said \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so maybe we should check both? However, the function allows specifying one event_type at a time. So perhaps the user wants both types, but the function can only handle one at a time. But since the user mentioned both, maybe we should call the function twice, once for Music and once for Theater. But the user might want both types, so maybe the assistant should handle that. However, the current turn requires making function calls. Since the user didn't specify which one, but both, perhaps the assistant should make two separate calls. But the problem is that the system might not allow multiple calls in one turn. Wait, the instructions say that if you decide to invoke any function(s), you must put them in the JSON format. So maybe the assistant can make two function calls here, one for each event_type. Let me check the function parameters again. The event_type is an enum with 'Music' and 'Theater'. So to cover both possibilities, the assistant should make two separate calls. But the user might want both types of events. However, the user's message says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", which implies either one. But the assistant might need to check both. However, the system's instructions say to make one or more function calls. So in this case, making two calls would be appropriate. \n\nWait, but the user might not want to make two separate searches. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both types if we pass both, but looking at the parameters, event_type is a single string, not an array. So the function can only handle one event_type at a time. Therefore, to cover both possibilities, the assistant needs to call the function twice, once with 'Music' and once with 'Theater'. \n\nSo the correct approach is to make two function calls. Each call uses Events_3_FindEvents with the respective event_type, same city and date. \n\nBut the user's date is March 10th. Let me confirm the date format. The function's date parameter expects 'YYYY-MM-DD', so '2023-03-10' is correct. \n\nTherefore, the two function calls would be:\n\n1. event_type: 'Music', city: 'New York, NY', date: '2023-03-10'\n2. event_type: 'Theater', city: 'New York, NY', date: '2023-03-10'\n\nThis way, both types of events are searched. The user might get results for both concerts and plays. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The city is 'New York, NY', which is in the required format. The date is correctly formatted. \n\nSo the JSON for the two function calls would be:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"Events_3_FindEvents\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"event_type\": \"Music\",\n      \"city\": \"New York, NY\",\n      \"date\": \"2023-03-10\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"Events_3_FindEvents\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"event_type\": \"Theater\",\n      \"city\": \"New York, NY\",\n      \"date\": \"2023-03-10\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nThis should cover both possibilities the user mentioned."}

The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia, Music_3_LookupMusic, and Weather_1_GetWeather. Since the user is asking to hear a song, the PlayMedia function seems relevant. But before playing, maybe I need to look up the song to ensure it exists in their library, especially since they mentioned specific criteria.\n\nThe user specified the album \"Gotta Be Me\", the genre as Hillbilly (which might be similar to Country), and the year 2019. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can search based on artist, album, genre, and year. However, the genre options in the function include Country but not Hillbilly. Maybe Hillbilly is considered a subgenre under Country here. So I should use the LookupMusic function with genre set to Country, album as \"Gotta Be Me\", and year 2019. \n\nWait, the user might not have specified the artist. The LookupMusic function allows filtering by artist, but since they didn't mention one, I should leave it as default 'dontcare'. After looking up, if there's a track found, then use PlayMedia with the track name, album, and possibly artist if available. But the user hasn't provided the track name, so maybe the Lookup is necessary to find possible tracks. However, the user's ultimate goal is to play a song, so maybe directly using PlayMedia with the given parameters. Let me check the parameters for PlayMedia. It requires 'track' which the user hasn't provided. So without the track name, I can't directly call PlayMedia. Therefore, first, I need to use LookupMusic to find songs matching the criteria (album Gotta Be Me, genre Country, year 2019) and then play one of the results. But since the system can only make function calls and can't process the results itself, maybe the assistant should first call LookupMusic to get the track names, then use that information to call PlayMedia. However, in this setup, each turn is a separate function call. So the assistant would first call LookupMusic with the parameters, and then in the next turn, based on the response, call PlayMedia. But the user hasn't provided the track name, so the assistant needs to first find possible tracks. Therefore, the correct first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album \"Gotta Be Me\", genre \"Country\", and year \"2019\". The artist can be left as 'dontcare'. Then, once the lookup returns possible tracks, the assistant can use that data to call PlayMedia. But since the user hasn't specified the track, the assistant can't proceed to PlayMedia without that info. So the initial function call should be LookupMusic to find the track. Then, assuming the lookup returns a track, the next step would be to call PlayMedia. But in this case, the user's message is a single request. The assistant needs to handle it in one turn. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the track name, so the assistant can't call PlayMedia yet. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call LookupMusic to find the track, and then use that result to play it. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So the first response should be to call LookupMusic. Then, in the next turn, after receiving the lookup results, the assistant can call PlayMedia. But the user's question is a single input. So the assistant's first step is to call LookupMusic. Therefore, the function call should be Music_3_LookupMusic with album \"Gotta Be Me\", genre \"Country\", year \"2019\", and artist \"dontcare\"."}

Since the user didn't specify needing metadata, I can leave it as default.\n\nSo, calling get_websites with status_filter set to 'active' (which is the default, but maybe better to specify explicitly to ensure it's clear). That should give the list of active websites. The other functions like get_website require a websiteId which the user hasn't provided, so they aren't needed here.

The user might have regular API tokens and shareable ones.

The post_api_token's user_id is an integer, but the user provided a string. But since the user ID here is \"user123\", which is a string, the functions that require a string user_id are the correct ones. The post function might not be needed here.\n\nSo, I'll call both get_api_tokens and get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired as False by default.

The create_global_application_alert_config function seems right. It requires name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. The parameters given by the user include all these: name is provided, alert_type should be 'error_rate', threshold is 5% which is 0.05 as a float, and recipients are the two emails. The enabled parameter has a default of True, so even if not specified, it's okay. \n\nWait, the threshold in the function's parameters is a float. The user says 5%, so converting that to 0.05 makes sense. The recipients need to be an array of strings. The other parameters like enabled aren't mentioned, so using the default. So the function call should include all required parameters correctly. I don't see any missing required parameters here. The other functions like enable_global_application_alert_config require an id, but since the user is creating a new config, that's not needed yet.

The user is asking for all their API tokens and provided their user ID as 12345. They're pretty urgent with \"NOW!!!\" so I need to act quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There are two functions related to API tokens: CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. \n\nThe first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user provided the user_id as 12345, so that's covered. The default for include_revoked is False, which means it won't include revoked tokens unless specified. But the user didn't mention revoked tokens, so maybe they want all active ones. \n\nThe second function, get_api_tokens, doesn't require any parameters, but it has options like include_expired, page, and page_size. Since the user wants \"all\" tokens, maybe we need to set a large page_size or handle pagination. However, the default page_size is 20, which might not get all tokens if there are more than 20. But the user didn't specify any details about pagination, so maybe just using the default is okay for now. Also, include_expired is False by default, so expired tokens won't be included unless specified. The user didn't mention expired tokens, so perhaps they want the active ones.\n\nWait, the user's main goal is to get all API tokens. Which function is the right one? The first function is for shareable API tokens, while the second is for API tokens in general. The user might need both, but the question is a bit ambiguous. However, since they provided the user_id, the first function requires it, so that's a good candidate. The second function doesn't require user_id, but maybe it's for the current user's tokens. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe they want to ensure it's for their account. \n\nBut looking at the functions, get_api_tokens doesn't require user_id. If the user is authenticated, maybe the second function can retrieve their tokens without needing the user_id. However, since the user provided the user_id, perhaps the first function is more appropriate. But the description of get_api_tokens says it retrieves tokens associated with the user's account, so maybe it's the right one. \n\nWait, the first function is part of CustomDashboardsApi and specifically retrieves shareable API tokens. The second function is part of APITokenApi and retrieves API tokens. The user might be referring to the general API tokens, so the second function is more likely the correct one. However, the user's user_id is required for the first function, but not for the second. Since the user provided the user_id, maybe they want to use the first function. But the second function might not require it because it's for the authenticated user. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the function descriptions. The first function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens associated with the user's account, and it requires user_id. The second function's description says it retrieves API tokens associated with the user's account, but doesn't require any parameters. So if the user is authenticated, the second function can get their tokens without needing the user_id. However, the user provided the user_id, so maybe they want to use the first function. But the user might not know the difference between shareable and regular tokens. \n\nSince the user is asking for \"all API tokens,\" it's possible they want both, but the functions are separate. However, the user might not need to specify which one. Given that the user provided the user_id, and the first function requires it, perhaps the correct approach is to call the first function with the given user_id. But the second function might be the one that actually retrieves all tokens, including non-shareable ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to call both functions to get all possible tokens. But the user's message is urgent, so maybe just call the one that's appropriate. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but since the user provided the user_id, and the first function requires it, I'll proceed with calling get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345. The include_revoked is optional, defaulting to False, which is fine unless the user wants revoked ones, which they didn't mention. \n\nBut wait, the user might actually need the second function. Let me think again. The second function, get_api_tokens, doesn't require parameters, so if the user is authenticated, it would return their tokens. But the user provided their user_id, which is required for the first function. Since the user is in a hurry, maybe they want to ensure that the correct user's tokens are retrieved, hence using the first function with the provided user_id. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is not authenticated, and the user_id is needed for the second function. But according to the parameters, the second function doesn't require user_id. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. To cover all bases, perhaps call both functions. But the user might not need both. However, the user's request is to get all API tokens, so maybe both functions are needed. \n\nWait, the first function is for shareable API tokens, which might be a subset of all API tokens. The second function is for API tokens in general. So to get all tokens, the user might need to call both functions. \n\nBut the user's message is urgent, so maybe the assistant should call both functions. However, the user might not have permissions for both. But given the information, the assistant should proceed with the functions that can be called with the provided parameters. \n\nSo, first, call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345. Then, call get_api_tokens with default parameters. But the user might need to specify more parameters for get_api_tokens to get all pages. However, the user didn't mention pagination, so maybe just the first page is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, to get all tokens, the assistant might need to handle pagination, but since the user is in a hurry, maybe just the first page is okay. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant should call both functions to cover all possibilities. So the function calls would be:\n\n1. CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345.\n2. api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with default parameters.\n\nBut the user might not need both. However, given the ambiguity, it's safer to call both."}
