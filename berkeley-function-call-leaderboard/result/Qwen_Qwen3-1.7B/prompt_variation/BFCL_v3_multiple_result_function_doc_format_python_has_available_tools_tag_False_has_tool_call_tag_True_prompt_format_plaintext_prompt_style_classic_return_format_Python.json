There's video_games.store_price, which gets the selling price. But the question is about the cheapest price. However, the store_price function might just return the current price, not the cheapest. But maybe the function is designed to return the price, and the user wants the current price. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the cheapest, but the functions provided don't include a function to find the cheapest. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the cheapest selling price. But the available functions are store_price, which gives the current price. If the store_price function returns the current price, then that's the cheapest. But maybe there's a possibility that the price is not the cheapest, but the function doesn't provide that info. However, the user's question is about the cheapest, so perhaps the store_price function is the one to use here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the lowest price, but the functions don't have a way to find the lowest. So, the best approach is to use the store_price function with the game title, platform, and region.

The circle function is for circles, which isn't relevant here.\n\nSo the correct function to use is geometry_rectangle. The parameters required are width and length. The user provided both: 7 and 10.

The user is asking to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about acceleration, but the user wants the final speed. \n\nWait, the functions provided are kinematics.calculate_acceleration and kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check what each does. \n\nThe calculate_speed_from_rest function takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration. But the parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). \n\nWait, but the user is asking for final speed. The calculate_speed_from_rest function might be the right one here. Because if the object starts from rest (initial_speed=0), and we know distance and time, maybe we can compute the speed using the formula v = u + at, but since we have distance and time, maybe it's better to use the function provided. \n\nBut the function calculate_speed_from_rest might require distance and time. Let me think. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). So if the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function might use the formula v = (2 * distance) / time, but that's for constant acceleration. Wait, the formula for final speed when starting from rest is v = (2 * distance) / time. But that's if acceleration is constant. \n\nAlternatively, using the kinematics equations: s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Since u=0, s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. So a = 2s/t\u00b2. Then v = u + a*t = 0 + (2s/t\u00b2)*t = 2s/t. So v = 2s/t. \n\nBut the user is asking for the speed, so maybe the calculate_speed_from_rest function is designed to take distance and time, and compute the speed. However, the function's parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. So if the initial_speed is 0, then the function would compute the speed as (2 * distance) / time. \n\nSo in this case, the user's question can be answered by calling calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nBut wait, the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). So the user's question has distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. So the function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function calculate_acceleration is needed, but the user is asking for speed, not acceleration. So the correct function here is calculate_speed_from_rest. \n\nTherefore, the correct tool call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

I remember that when two gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. The formula is something like (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2) = T_final. Where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature.
