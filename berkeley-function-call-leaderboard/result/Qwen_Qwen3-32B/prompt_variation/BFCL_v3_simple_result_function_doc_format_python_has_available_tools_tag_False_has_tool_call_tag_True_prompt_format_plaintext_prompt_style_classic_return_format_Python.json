For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance.

So if the user wants cases filed after that date, maybe the start_date is inclusive. But the user's query says \"after\", which is exclusive. However, the function might not support exclusive ranges, so perhaps we have to use the start_date as the earliest date. Maybe the function's start_date is the starting point, and the user wants cases from that date onwards. But the user specified \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be the next day? Wait, but the user might just want to use the start_date as the cutoff.

Location isn't needed here. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other required parameters. The function's required args are team_name, num_of_games, and league? Wait, no, looking back: the function's Args section lists team_name, num_of_games, league (with a note that it's optional), and location (optional). Wait, the function's parameters: the first three are team_name (str), num_of_games (int), league (str, optional). Wait, no, the function's Args list league as optional? Let me check again.\n\nThe Args section says: team_name (str), num_of_games (int), league (str): optional. So league is optional. So the user provided league, so include it. So the function call should have team_name=\"Manchester United\", num_of_games=6, league=\"Premier League\". Location isn't specified, so it's okay to leave it out. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is sports_team.get_schedule with those parameters. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The num_of_games is an integer, so 6 is correct. All parameters are provided as keyword arguments. That should do it."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the boardgame.get_info function. The parameters needed are name, parameters, and language. The name is given as 'Ticket to Ride'. The parameters they want are rating and player count, which I think correspond to 'rating' and 'players' in the function's parameters list. The language defaults to English, so I don't need to specify that unless they want another language. So I should call the function with name='Ticket to Ride' and parameters=['rating', 'players']. Let me make sure those are the correct parameter names. The function's parameters argument is a list of game characteristics, so 'rating' and 'player count' should be valid. Alright, that should do it."}

So I need to call the function with rank='Queen' and suit='Hearts'. The deck parameter is optional, so I can omit it. The function should handle the rest. I'll make sure the parameters are correctly named and in the right order. That's all, no other functions are needed here."}

The user specified location as Manhattan, New York, room_type is single, duration is 3 nights, start_date is March 10th, 2023. The preference here is that the hotel should be pet-friendly. \n\nSo, the parameters are all there. The preferences should be a list, so I'll include 'pet friendly' in that list. The function allows preferences as an optional parameter, so I can add it. I need to make sure the start_date is in the correct string format. March 10th, 2023 can be written as '2023-03-10' to be unambiguous. \n\nPutting it all together: location is 'Manhattan, New York', room_type is 'single', duration is 3, start_date is '2023-03-10', and preferences is ['pet friendly']. \n\nI think that's all the required parameters. The function should handle this. No missing parameters here. So the tool call should include all these arguments."}
