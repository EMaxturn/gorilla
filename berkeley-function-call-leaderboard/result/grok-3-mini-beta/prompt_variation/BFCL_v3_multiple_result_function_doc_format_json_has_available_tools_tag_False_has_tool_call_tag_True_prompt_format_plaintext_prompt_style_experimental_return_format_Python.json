The user said \"in the upcoming month\", which aligns with the description: \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, I don't need to specify this if it defaults to upcoming.\n\n- **user_ratings**: Optional. The user said \"top rated\", which could map to 'high' ratings. The description says: \"Default is 'high'\". So, if I don't specify, it will use 'high', which is what we want for \"top rated\".\n\nSince the required parameters are 'location' and 'art_form', I can make this call.\n\nParameters to use:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\" \u2013 The description example is \"New York, NY\", so I should use that format.\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" \u2013 Based on the query.\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will default to upcoming.\n\n- user_ratings: Not specified, so it defaults to 'high', which matches \"top rated\".\n\nI can call **find_exhibition** with location and art_form.\n\nThe function call format should be: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this: <TOOLCALL>[find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems complete. The user didn't ask for anything else, so this should fulfill the request.\n\nFinally, remember to only return the function call in the specified format, nothing else."}

Looking at the available functions, there's one called 'book_hotel' that matches this.\n\nLet me check the description: \"Book a room in a specific hotel with particular preferences.\"\n\nThe parameters for 'book_hotel' are:\n\n- hotel_name: string, required\n\n- location: string, required\n\n- room_type: string, required\n\n- start_date: string, in format MM-DD-YYYY, required\n\n- stay_duration: integer, required\n\n- view: string, optional, with a default of 'No preference'\n\nFrom the user's query:\n\n- Hotel name: Hotel Paradise\n\n- Location: Las Vegas\n\n- Room type: luxury room (I need to interpret this as the room_type)\n\n- Start date: May 12, 2022, which should be formatted as 05-12-2022 (MM-DD-YYYY)\n\n- Stay duration: 3 days\n\n- View: city view\n\nAll required parameters are present in the query.\n\nSo, I can construct a function call for 'book_hotel' with these values.\n\nLet me map them:\n\n- hotel_name: \"Hotel Paradise\"\n\n- location: \"Las Vegas\"\n\n- room_type: \"luxury room\" (assuming that's how it's specified)\n\n- start_date: \"05-12-2022\" (need to format it correctly)\n\n- stay_duration: 3\n\n- view: \"city view\"\n\nThe view parameter is not required, but since the user specified it, I should include it.\n\nNow, for the response format: I need to return only the function calls enclosed in <TOOLCALL> tags, like <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, it should be: <TOOLCALL>[book_hotel(hotel_name=\"Hotel Paradise\", location=\"Las Vegas\", room_type=\"luxury room\", start_date=\"05-12-2022\", stay_duration=3, view=\"city view\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nIs the date format correct? The user said \"May 12, 2022\", which is MM-DD-YYYY: May is 05, 12 is the day, 2022 is the year, so yes, \"05-12-2022\".\n\nThis seems to fully address the user's request, so I don't need multiple calls.\n\nOnce this is done, the system will handle the next steps."}
