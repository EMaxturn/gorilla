Wait, but in the US, people usually use Fahrenheit. Hmm, but the default is celsius. Maybe I should check if the user wants a specific unit, but they didn't mention it. So I'll proceed with the default.\n\nSo I need to call get_current_weather for each city. First for Boston, MA, then for San Francisco.

All required parameters are present. The location should be in 'City, State' format. New York is typically 'New York, NY', so I'll use that.

The user wants to log their food intake. They mentioned two instances: first, 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea, and earlier, two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\n\nLooking at the available function, it's log_food. The parameters required are food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type (optional, default snack), and log_date (optional, default None). \n\nFor the first entry: 8 pieces of mango. The portion_unit should be 'piece' as per the enum. The food_name is 'frozen mango'. Portion_amount is 8.0. Meal_type isn't specified, so default to 'snack'. Log_date isn't given, so use default.\n\nThen, the chai tea. Need to log that too. But the function parameters don't mention beverage. Wait, the food_name can be 'chai tea'. The portion_amount and unit? The user didn't specify, but maybe assume a standard portion. But the problem is, the user didn't provide the amount for the tea. Wait, the original message says \"I had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea.\" So the chai tea is a separate item. But the portion details aren't given. Hmm, the function requires portion_amount and portion_unit. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I can't log it? Or maybe assume a default? But the function doesn't allow that. So perhaps I should only log the mango and the pizza, since they have the portion details. The tea and coffee might be missing parameters. Wait, the user also mentioned earlier: two slices of pizza and a coffee. Again, coffee's portion isn't specified. \n\nWait, the user might have intended that the chai tea and coffee are logged with default portion? But the function requires those parameters. So if the user didn't specify, maybe I can't log them. But the user might expect that the assistant can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should ask for clarification, but according to the task, if parameters are missing, point it out. However, the task says if the question lacks parameters, point it out. But in this case, the user's message is the input, and the assistant needs to make function calls. So for the first part: 8 pieces of mango, that's loggable. The chai tea: no portion info. Similarly, the pizza has two slices (so log that), and coffee has no portion. So the assistant should log the mango and pizza, but note that the tea and coffee can't be logged due to missing parameters. But the user might have intended that the assistant uses default values, but the function doesn't allow that. So the correct approach is to call log_food for the mango and pizza, and ignore the tea and coffee because they lack portion details. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make assumptions, but according to the instructions, if parameters are missing, point it out. However, the task says to make function calls if possible, else point out. So the answer would be two function calls: one for mango, one for pizza. The tea and coffee are not logged because their portion info is missing."}

Both using the default unit of Fahrenheit. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. No other parameters needed since unit is optional. Alright, that's all."}
