The user is asking for an Uber ride. They specified the type as 'Plus', the address as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', and a maximum wait time of 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. Let me look at their parameters.\n\nFor uber.ride, the required parameters are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So that's all set.\n\nNow, uber.ride2 also has loc and type as required, but the loc is in 'City, State' format. The user's address includes the street, so using ride2 might not be appropriate here. Also, ride2's time has a default of 10, but the user explicitly said 10. However, since ride2's loc requires just city and state, maybe it's better to use ride instead. Wait, the user's loc is a full address, so ride is the correct one. So the correct function is uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. I should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The enum for type includes 'plus', so that's okay. Time is 10, which is an integer. So the function call should be uber.ride with those parameters."}

They want the results in text format, up to 10. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the tools, HNA_WQA.search is for web searches, which fits. The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user specified the keyword as \"\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780\", result_format as text, and max_results as 10. The language isn't mentioned, but the default is EN. However, since the keyword is in Korean, maybe the user prefers results in Korean. But the language parameter options are EN, ES, FR, DE. Hmm, the default is EN, but the user might want Korean results. Wait, the language parameter for HNA_WQA.search is for the result language. Since the tool's language options don't include Korean, maybe the search will still work with the keyword in Korean. The function might handle it, or maybe the results will be in Korean regardless. But according to the parameters, the language can only be set to EN, ES, FR, DE. The user didn't specify, so the default is EN. But the keyword is in Korean, so maybe the search will return Korean results even if the language is set to EN. Not sure, but the user's instruction is to use the keyword as is. So proceed with the default language EN, but the actual results might be in Korean. The max_results is 10, which matches the user's request. So the correct function call is HNA_WQA.search with keyword=\"\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780\", result_format=\"text\", max_results=10. The language remains default EN unless specified, but the user didn't mention it. So the tool call should be made with those parameters."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the October 2019 statement period. They provided specific details like account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name (U.S. Bank), account number (1-523-1713-5704), account type (checking), full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING), and the transaction details like start and end dates, total deposits, withdrawals, and balances. \n\nThe transaction_overview parameter needs a dictionary with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019, so those dates should be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The start_date would be '2019-10-01' and end_date '2019-10-31'. The total_deposits are $7,132.76 and total_withdrawals $5,927.40.\n\nSo, I can call BankStatementOverView with these parameters. Then, the user also wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just the totals. The transactions array is required, but without the specific transactions, I can't fill that in. Maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve the transactions for the period. The Alltransactions function needs the statement_period as '2019-10' and include_pending if needed. But the user didn't mention pending transactions, so default is False.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the Alltransactions function is needed first to get the list. However, the user is asking to include a summary, which implies that the transactions are already known. Since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the assistant can't generate the summary without the transactions. But the user might expect that the functions can be called to retrieve the data. However, in the given scenario, the user is providing the data, so maybe the functions are to be called with the provided data. \n\nWait, the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, but not the individual transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the assistant can't call that function. However, the user might have intended that the Alltransactions function is used to get the transactions for the period. But the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so perhaps the assistant can't proceed. \n\nBut the user is asking to include a summary, so maybe the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019, then use that data to generate the summary. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't simulate that. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should call BankStatementOverView first, and then note that the transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array, which isn't provided. But the user might expect that the functions are called with the available data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the BankStatementOverView is sufficient, and the transaction summary is part of that. But the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview is a summary, not the individual transactions. The user wants a summary of transactions, which might be covered by the transaction_summary.generate function, but that requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, perhaps the assistant can't generate that. \n\nIn this case, the assistant can call BankStatementOverView with the provided data, and then note that the transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the individual transactions. However, the user might have intended that the Alltransactions function is used to retrieve the transactions for the period. So, the assistant should first call Alltransactions for the period '2019-10', then use that data to generate the summary. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't proceed further. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and then call Alltransactions to get the transactions for the period, which can then be used in transaction_summary.generate. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can only call the functions that can be filled with the given data. \n\nSo, the first step is to call BankStatementOverView with the provided data. Then, call Alltransactions for the period '2019-10' to get the transactions. Once those are retrieved, the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the transactions array. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't simulate that. Therefore, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions, and then perhaps the transaction_summary.generate once the transactions are available. \n\nBut the user's question is to provide the overview and include the summary. Since the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the transactions array as an empty list or with the totals. However, the function requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and Alltransactions to retrieve the transactions for the period. Then, once the transactions are retrieved, call transaction_summary.generate. But given the current data, only the first two functions can be called."}

The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here.

Looking at the enum options, there's 'moderate' which is the default. So I should set price_range to 'moderate'. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires it in 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and the state is NY, the location should be 'New York, NY'. \n\nThe category isn't specified, but the function requires it. Wait, the user didn't mention a specific cuisine. Hmm, maybe I need to leave that out? Wait, no, the parameters for FindRestaurants have 'category' as a required field. The user didn't specify a category, so maybe I should choose a general one? But the enum includes 'American' or 'California', but maybe the user didn't specify. Wait, the function requires 'category' to be one of the listed options. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should pick a general category like 'American' or leave it out? Wait, no, the required parameters are 'category' and 'location'. So I can't omit category. But the user didn't mention it. Maybe the assistant needs to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with any category as long as the other criteria are met. But the function requires a category. So perhaps the assistant should select a default or general category. Looking at the enum, 'American' might be a safe choice here. Alternatively, maybe 'Bistro' or 'Restaurant' but 'Bistro' is in the enum. Wait, the enum includes 'Bistro', 'Izakaya', etc. But maybe the user didn't specify, so perhaps the assistant should pick a general one. Alternatively, maybe the user's query is too vague, but the function requires a category. So I need to pick one. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant should use a default. Wait, the function doesn't have a default for category. So perhaps the assistant has to make a choice. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave it open, but the function requires it. In that case, maybe the assistant should select a general category like 'American' or 'Bistro'. Let me check the enum again. The category options include 'American', which is a broad category. So I'll go with 'American' for the category. \n\nSo putting it all together: category='American', location='New York, NY', price_range='moderate', has_seating_outdoors=True. The other parameters like has_vegetarian_options are optional and default to False, which is okay unless the user specified, which they didn't.

The user specified the album 'The New Classic', so I should set the album parameter to that. For the year, since they want tracks from around 2017, I'll set the year to '2017'. The artist parameter isn't mentioned, so I'll use the default 'dontcare' unless 'The New Classic' is associated with a specific artist. Wait, but the user didn't mention the artist, so maybe I should leave that as 'dontcare' as well. However, the album might be from a specific artist, but since the user didn't specify, it's safer to use 'dontcare' for artist. The genre isn't mentioned either, so set that to 'dontcare'. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for album and artist have defaults of 'dontcare', so if the user specifies an album, we should use that. So the parameters would be album='The New Classic', year='2017', artist='dontcare', genre='dontcare'. That should find songs similar to that album and from 2017. Let me check the enum for the year.

The required parameters are payment_method, amount, and receiver. The private_visibility is optional with a default of False, but the user wants it private, so we need to set that to True.\n\nThe payment_method is specified as \"debit card\" in the user's request.

Wait, the description for Payment_1_RequestPayment says \"smallest unit (e.g., cents for USD)\", but for Payment_1_MakePayment, the description says \"specified in USD.\" Hmm, that's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nFor Payment_1_RequestPayment, the amount is in the smallest unit (cents). For Payment_1_MakePayment, the amount is described as \"monetary value to be sent, specified in USD.\" Wait, that's different. So if the user says $200, then in Payment_1_MakePayment, the amount should be 200.0, not 20000. Because that function's parameter expects USD, not cents. But the other function uses cents.

The user wants to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. So first, I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. \n\nLooking at Music_3_PlayMedia, it requires a track name, and optionally artist, device, and album. But the user hasn't specified a particular track; they want either from the album or from 2019. So maybe first, I should use Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs that match either the album 'High Expectations' or the year 2019.\n\nThe Music_3_LookupMusic function allows filtering by artist, album, genre, and year. The user's query mentions the album 'High Expectations' and the year 2019. So I can set the album parameter to 'High Expectations' and the year to '2019'. The other parameters like artist and genre can be set to 'dontcare' since they're not specified. \n\nWait, but the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic have defaults: artist and album default to 'dontcare', genre defaults to 'dontcare', and year also has a default of 'dontcare'. So if I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to '2019', the function will look for songs that match either of those criteria. However, the way the parameters work, I think the function might combine these as OR conditions. So the lookup would return songs from the album 'High Expectations' OR from 2019. \n\nOnce I get the list of songs from Music_3_LookupMusic, then I can use Music_3_PlayMedia to play one of those tracks. But the user hasn't specified which track, so maybe after looking up, the system would need to select a track from the results. However, since the user hasn't specified a particular track, perhaps the assistant should first retrieve the list using LookupMusic and then play a track from that list. But the user's current request is just to hear a track that meets either of the two conditions, so maybe the first step is to look up the songs, and then play one. But since the user hasn't specified which one, maybe the assistant needs to choose, but the functions available don't allow for selection. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to generate function calls. So the assistant should first call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get the list of songs. Then, once that's done, perhaps the next step would be to play one of those songs. However, the user hasn't specified a particular song, so maybe the assistant would need to ask for clarification, but since the task is to generate function calls, perhaps the assistant should first call LookupMusic and then PlayMedia with the first result or something. But the problem is that the assistant can't know the results of LookupMusic in advance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can only generate the LookupMusic call first, and then in a subsequent step, once the results are known, generate the PlayMedia call. But since the user's current query is a single request, the assistant should generate the necessary function calls in sequence. However, the current setup is that each turn is a single function call. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"In each turn, do your best to fully address the user's request. Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete. Once no more calls are needed, the system will proceed to the next turn.\" So the assistant can generate multiple function calls in sequence if needed. \n\nSo the correct approach here is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get the list of songs. Then, once that list is obtained, use Music_3_PlayMedia to play one of the songs from the list. However, since the user hasn't specified which song, the assistant would need to choose one from the results. But since the assistant can't know the results, perhaps the first step is to call LookupMusic, and then in the next turn, after the results are available, call PlayMedia. But in this case, the user's current query is a single request, so the assistant should generate the first function call (LookupMusic) and then, assuming the results are available, generate the PlayMedia call. However, the user's input is a single message, so the assistant needs to generate all necessary function calls in one go. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to generate one or more function calls in each turn. So the assistant can generate multiple function calls in one turn if needed. But in this case, the assistant can't know the results of the LookupMusic call to then pass to PlayMedia. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the specified parameters, and then, once the results are available, call Music_3_PlayMedia with a track from the results. However, since the user hasn't specified a particular track, the assistant can't know which one to play. Therefore, the assistant should first call LookupMusic to get the list, and then perhaps the user would need to select a track from the list. But since the user's request is to \"hear a track\", the assistant might need to play a track from the lookup results. However, without knowing the specific track, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the LookupMusic function to get the list, and then use the first track from the list as the 'track' parameter in PlayMedia. But since the assistant doesn't have access to the actual data, it can't know the track names. Therefore, the assistant can only generate the LookupMusic call, and then in a subsequent step (after the system has the results), generate the PlayMedia call. But in the current setup, the user is providing a single query, so the assistant must generate all necessary function calls in one go. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can make two function calls: first, LookupMusic to get the list, and then PlayMedia with a placeholder track name. But that's not feasible. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters album='High Expectations' and year='2019', and then, once the results are available, call Music_3_PlayMedia with a track from the results. However, since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant can't proceed beyond the first call. Therefore, the assistant should generate the LookupMusic call first. \n\nSo the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019', and the other parameters set to 'dontcare'. Then, once the system has the list of songs, the user can be presented with options, but since the user's request is to \"hear a track\", the assistant might need to play a track from the list. However, without knowing the track names, the assistant can't generate the PlayMedia call. Therefore, the assistant should only generate the LookupMusic call in this turn, and then in the next turn, after the results are available, generate the PlayMedia call. But since the user's current input is a single message, the assistant can only generate the first function call here. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete. So perhaps the assistant can generate both the LookupMusic and PlayMedia calls in sequence, assuming that the LookupMusic will return a track. However, since the assistant doesn't have the actual data, it's impossible to know which track to play. Therefore, the correct approach is to generate the LookupMusic call first, and then, once the results are available, generate the PlayMedia call. But in this case, the user's query is a single message, so the assistant can only generate the first function call. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019'. The other parameters (artist and genre) are set to 'dontcare' as per the user's request. So the parameters would be:\n\nalbum: 'High Expectations'\nyear: '2019'\nartist: 'dontcare'\ngenre: 'dontcare'\n\nBut looking at the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic, the required parameters are none, and the properties are artist (default 'dontcare'), album (default 'dontcare'), genre (default 'dontcare'), year (default 'dontcare'). So to specify both album and year, the assistant should set those parameters. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nMusic_3_LookupMusic(album='High Expectations', year='2019')\n\nBecause the other parameters have defaults. Therefore, the correct function call is to use Music_3_LookupMusic with those parameters. Then, once the list is retrieved, the assistant can proceed to play a track from that list. But since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant can't proceed further without additional information. Therefore, the first step is to call LookupMusic."}

The event_type can be 'Music' or 'Theater', which matches the user's request. The city is New York, so I'll format it as 'New York, NY'. The date is March 10th, which should be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so '2024-03-10' (assuming the current year, but maybe the user meant this year or next? Well, the user didn't specify the year, but the function's default is 'dontcare' if not provided. Wait, the function's parameters say the date has a default of 'dontcare', but the user did specify a date. So I should use the provided date. Since the user wrote March 10th, I'll format it as '2024-03-10' unless told otherwise. \n\nSo the parameters would be event_type: either 'Music' or 'Theater', but the user says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so maybe we should include both? Wait, the function's event_type is an enum with 'Music' and 'Theater'. Since the user is open to either, perhaps we need to make two separate calls, one for each event_type. But the function allows specifying one event_type per call. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both if we use one call for each. \n\nWait, the user's query is to find either, so maybe we need to call the function twice, once with 'Music' and once with 'Theater'. But the system might handle that. However, the user might want both types, so perhaps two function calls are needed. But the assistant should generate the necessary calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can accept both types in one call, but according to the parameters, event_type is a single enum value.

The user wrote \"March 10th\", which would be '2024-03-10' if this year. If the current date is past March 10th, maybe it's next year, but the user didn't specify. Since the function's date parameter allows 'dontcare' as a default, but the user specified a date, so we should use '2024-03-10' assuming it's this year. If the actual date is different, the user might need to adjust, but based on the given info, that's the correct format."}

Also, _class is an optional parameter with a default of Value, but the user wants Business class.\n\nThe date_of_journey is May 15, 2023. The journey_start_time is one day before, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, but the start time is one day before? That might not make sense. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is the next day? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to travel from Portland to Seattle on May 15, but the train departs one day before? That seems unlikely. Wait, the user wrote \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe that's a typo. Let me re-read the query.\n\n\"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014so the journey date is May 15, but the start time is one day before? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But the user wrote \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the start time is the day before? That would conflict with the date_of_journey being May 15. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the date or time. Since the date_of_journey is May 15, the journey_start_time should be on that date. Maybe the user intended to say the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is, say, 8:00 AM. But the user wrote \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the start time is the day before the journey date? That would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. That's conflicting. Maybe the user intended to book a journey that starts on May 15, but the start time is the next day? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant the journey is from May 15 to May 16, but the function parameters require a single date_of_journey. This is a problem. The function's date_of_journey is a single date. So perhaps the user made an error in specifying the start time as one day before. Since the function requires the date_of_journey as a single date, and the journey_start_time as a time on that date, maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But the user wrote \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe that's a mistake. Since the user's instruction is a bit unclear, but the function requires a date and a time, I'll proceed with the given date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and perhaps the journey_start_time is a specific time on that day. However, the user mentioned \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. That's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to book a round trip, but the function is for a single journey. This is a bit of a problem. Since the user's instruction is ambiguous, but the function requires a specific date and time, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and perhaps the journey_start_time is a time on that day. The user might have made a mistake in the \"one day before\" part. Alternatively, maybe they meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is the next day, but that's not possible. So I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and set the journey_start_time to a reasonable time, perhaps 8:00 AM. But the user didn't specify the exact time, so maybe they just want to book for that date, and the time is flexible. However, the function requires a journey_start_time. Since the user didn't provide a specific time, but mentioned \"starting at one day before\", which is conflicting, I might need to make an assumption here. Perhaps the user intended the journey to start on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. So I'll proceed with that. \n\nNow, the parameters for GetTrainTickets: _from is Portland, OR, to is Seattle, WA, date_of_journey is 2023-05-15 (format is YYYY-MM-DD), journey_start_time is, say, 08:00 (assuming 8 AM), number_of_adults is 4, trip_protection is True, and _class is Business. \n\nWait, the date_of_journey in the parameters for GetTrainTickets is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', which matches the user's input of May 15, 2023 as '2023-05-15'. The journey_start_time is in 'HH:MM' 24-hour format. The user didn't specify the exact time, but mentioned \"starting at one day before\"\u2014this is confusing. If the journey is on May 15, the start time can't be one day before. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is the next day? That's not possible. Perhaps the user intended to book a journey that starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. That's conflicting. Since the function requires the date_of_journey as a single date, I'll proceed with May 15, and set the journey_start_time to a default time, perhaps 08:00. The user might have made a mistake in the instruction, but I'll proceed with the available information.\n\nSo the function call would be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with parameters:\n\n_from='Portland, OR', to='Seattle, WA', date_of_journey='2023-05-15', journey_start_time='08:00', number_of_adults=4, trip_protection=True, _class='Business'.\n\nI need to check if all required parameters are present. The required parameters for GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. All are included here. The _class is optional, but the user wants business class, so it's set to 'Business'.\n\nSo the correct function call is Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with those parameters."}

The user provided the user_id as 12345, so that's covered. The include_revoked defaults to False, but the user wants all tokens, so maybe we should set that to True to include any revoked ones.

However, the default page_size is 20, and the user might not have that many. But to be thorough, maybe set a larger page_size, but the maximum is 100. However, the user didn't mention expired tokens, so include_expired could be True to include them all. But again, the default is False. Since the user wants all, setting include_expired=True would make sense here.\n\nWait, but the user's user ID is 12345. The first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires the user_id. The second function, get_api_tokens, doesn't have a user_id parameter. So maybe the first function is for shareable tokens specific to a user, while the second is for the current user's tokens? The user is asking for all their API tokens, so perhaps both functions are needed. But the user's ID is provided, so maybe they want tokens for that specific user. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id. That's confusing. Maybe the user is the one authenticated, so their own tokens, and the user_id is for the get_shareable_api_tokens. \n\nSo, to cover all possibilities, maybe call both functions. For get_shareable_api_tokens, use user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. For get_api_tokens, set include_expired=True to get all tokens, and maybe adjust page and page_size to get all pages. But without knowing the total number of pages, it's hard. The user might need to handle pagination, but since the user wants all, perhaps set a large page_size. However, the maximum is 100. So set page_size=100 and page=1. But if there are more than 100 tokens, they would need multiple pages. But the user might not know that. So maybe just use the default page and page_size, but include_expired=True. Alternatively, set page_size to 100 to maximize the number of tokens retrieved in one call. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True.\n2. api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, page=1, page_size=100.\n\nThat way, both functions are called to retrieve all possible tokens, considering the parameters available."}
