Each condition should be a dictionary (or similar structure) but note that the type for conditions is array.\n\n However, looking at the function definition, the conditions are of type array. We must represent each condition as an element in the array.\n\n Since the function doesn't specify the exact structure of a condition, we assume that each condition is a dictionary (or an object) that represents a condition on a column.\n\n Typically, a condition might have:\n   - column: the column name\n   - operator: the comparison operator (like '>', '=', etc.)\n   - value: the value to compare\n\n But note: the function description does not specify the exact keys. However, given the context, we can design the condition as:\n\n   [\n     { \"column\": \"age\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": 25 },\n     { \"column\": \"job\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\" }\n   ]\n\n However, the type of the conditions parameter is array, and each element must be a condition.

We are representing each condition as a dict (which in XML we can represent as a dict type? but note the function expects an array of conditions). However, in the XML representation for the function call, we must specify the type for each parameter. The conditions parameter is of type array.\n\n But note: the function call format we are to output must have each parameter with a type. How do we represent an array of dictionaries?\n\n The instruction says: the type fields must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, tuple.\n\n We can set:\n   conditions: type=\"array\"\n\n However, the value of an array must be represented appropriately. We are going to write the value as a JSON-like representation? But note: the system expects a specific format.\n\n Since the function call is in XML, we have to represent the array as a string? But that's not one of the types. Alternatively, we might represent it as an array of dicts.\n\n But the problem does not specify how to represent complex types in the value attribute. We must follow the instruction: the value should be a string representation that can be parsed appropriately.\n\n However, looking at the example format: \n   <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n For an array, we can represent the value as a JSON string? But the type is array, so the system might expect a string that can be parsed as JSON for the array.\n\n Alternatively, the system might be designed to handle nested structures. Since the problem does not specify, and we are constrained by the types, we have to represent the array of conditions as an array of dictionaries.\n\n How about we do:\n\n   <param name=\"conditions\" type=\"array\" value=\"[ ... ]\"/>\n\n But note: the value attribute is a string. So we must escape the string appropriately.\n\n Alternatively, the function call might be designed to take a string that is a JSON representation of the array.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and to avoid complexity, we might represent the condition array as a string in JSON format and set the type as array? But that would be inconsistent because the type is array but the value is a string.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n And we are using type=\"array\". But how to represent an array in the value? We cannot put an array directly in the value attribute because it's a string.\n\n This is a challenge. Let me re-read the instruction: it says \"in the format of ...\". The example only shows simple types.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the function expects an array, we must represent it as a string that can be parsed as an array. We'll use JSON.\n\n Therefore:\n   We set the type to \"array\", but the value will be a string that is the JSON representation of the array.\n\n Alternatively, the system might be designed to parse the value string as JSON for complex types.\n\n So:\n\n   conditions: \n      type = \"array\"\n      value = \"[ { \\\"column\\\": \\\"age\\\", \\\"operator\\\": \\\">\\\", \\\"value\\\": 25 }, { \\\"column\\\": \\\"job\\\", \\\"operator\\\": \\\"=\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"engineer\\\" } ]\"\n\n But note: the value for the condition on age has 25 as an integer, and for job as a string.\n\n However, the problem says: we must put the function call in the specified XML format.\n\n Alternatively, we might break down the array into multiple elements? But the function call format does not allow that.\n\n We must represent the entire array as one string.\n\n But wait: the function definition says the conditions parameter is of type array. So the system might be expecting a Python-like array representation? However, the function call is in XML.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use a JSON string and set the type to \"array\". The system on the other end will parse the JSON string to get the array.\n\n Alternatively, if the system expects a literal array structure in the value, we might have to represent it in a different way. But without more information, JSON is a standard.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and the format is fixed.\n\n Let me try to see if there's an alternative: the function call example does not show complex types. But the function definition says conditions is an array (without specifying the element type). \n\n We'll proceed with the JSON string representation.\n\n Alternatively, we might represent the array as a list of conditions in a non-JSON way? But that would be non-standard.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, we'll use JSON.\n\n Steps:\n\n   table: \"user\" (type string)\n   conditions: type array, value is the JSON string of the condition array.\n\n But note: the problem says the type must be one of the listed. We are using \"array\" for conditions, which is allowed.\n\n Let's write the function call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"database.query\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"table\" value=\"user\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"conditions\" value=\"[{&quot;column&quot;: &quot;age&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 25}, {&quot;column&quot;: &quot;job&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;=&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;engineer&quot;}]\" type=\"array\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note: in XML, we must escape the double quotes. We can use &quot; for the inner quotes.\n\n But the value attribute is in double quotes, so we must escape the inner double quotes. Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the attribute? But the example uses double.\n\n We'll use &quot; inside the attribute value.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a single-quoted string for the entire attribute? But the example uses double. And XML attributes can be in double or single. But the example format uses double.\n\n Since we are inside a double-quoted attribute, we must escape the inner double quotes as &quot;.\n\n Therefore, the conditions value string becomes:\n\n   \"[{&quot;column&quot;: &quot;age&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 25}, {&quot;column&quot;: &quot;job&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;=&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;engineer&quot;}]\"\n\n But note: the operator for greater than is '>', which is not a problem in XML as long as it's inside the string. But we are escaping the quotes, not the angle bracket. However, in XML, the '>' character is allowed in attribute values. So we can write it as \">\".\n\n Alternatively, we can escape it as &gt; for consistency? But it's not required in XML attribute values.\n\n However, to be safe, we can escape it as &gt;.\n\n So:\n\n   operator: &quot;&gt;&quot;\n\n But note: the value of the operator is a string, so we are representing it as a string. So the condition for age becomes:\n\n   {&quot;column&quot;: &quot;age&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 25}\n\n Similarly, for job:\n\n   {&quot;column&quot;: &quot;job&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;=&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;engineer&quot;}\n\n Therefore, the entire conditions value:\n\n   \"[{&quot;column&quot;: &quot;age&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 25}, {&quot;column&quot;: &quot;job&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;=&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;engineer&quot;}]\"\n\n However, note that the value for the age condition is a number (25) without quotes. In JSON, that's valid.\n\n But when we put it in the string, it will be:\n\n   ... &quot;value&quot;: 25 ...\n\n That is valid JSON.\n\n Alternatively, we could represent the entire array without spaces to minimize? But it's not necessary.\n\n We are now ready to write the function call.\n\n Important: We are only making one function call.\n\n Let's write the XML accordingly."}

So we use only the city.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the full string \"Los Angeles, California\" as the location? \n The function description does not specify the exact format beyond \"city name\". \n\n Since the user provided the state, and we don't know if the function's backend can handle the state, we have two options:\n\n Option 1: Use just \"Los Angeles\" (the city name) as the location.\n Option 2: Use the full string \"Los Angeles, California\" to be more specific.\n\n Without knowing the backend, we choose the safer option: use the city name as per the function description. \n So we use \"Los Angeles\".\n\n However, if the function's backend is designed for a specific country and state, then the city alone might be sufficient because the system might be for California? \n But we are not told. \n\n Since the function description does not specify, we follow the instruction: use the city name.\n\n Therefore, we will call the function with:\n   year: 2020\n   crime_type: \"theft crimes\"\n   location: \"Los Angeles\"\n\n But note: the user said \"Los Angeles, California\". We are removing the state. This might cause ambiguity if there are multiple Los Angeles? \n But in the context of California, Los Angeles is a well-known city. However, the function does not specify the state.\n\n We are going to assume that the function's backend is designed to handle city names uniquely within a country (or within the scope of the data) or that the city name is enough.\n\n Alternatively, we might be required to include the state? We don't have a parameter for state.\n\n Given the constraints, we have to use the location as \"Los Angeles\".\n\n However, if the function expects the location to be in a specific format (like including state) then we are not told. \n We must stick to the function's parameter description.\n\n Let's call the function as instructed.\n\n We are going to output:\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"civil_cases.retrieve\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"year\" value=\"2020\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    <param name=\"crime_type\" value=\"theft crimes\" type=\"string\"/>\n    <param name=\"location\" value=\"Los Angeles\" type=\"string\"/>\n  </params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

But note the function requires the work_title.\n\n We have two options:\n   1. Use the common name \"law of universal gravitation\" as the work_title? But note the function might expect the actual publication title.\n   2. Use the actual book title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" or in English \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\".\n\n Since the function is designed for scientific works, it is likely that the database uses the actual publication title.\n\n However, the user's question does not specify the exact title. We must rely on the information given.\n\n But note: the function description says \"Title of the scientific work\". We are not sure if it accepts the common name.\n\n Since we don't have the exact title from the user, we might try with the common name? But that might not be in the database.\n\n Alternatively, we can try with the well-known title: \"Principia Mathematica\" or the full Latin title? But the function might accept the English translation.\n\n However, the function does not specify the language. We can try the English title: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\".\n\n But note: the work is most commonly known by its Latin title. We might need to try both? But the function only allows one call at a time? Actually, we can make multiple function calls? However, the instruction says we can output multiple function calls in the same TOOLCALL.\n\n However, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until ...\"\n\n So we can call the function multiple times with different titles? But that might be inefficient and we don't know which one is correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the most common and official title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\". But note that the function might not have the exact string.\n\n Since we are not sure, we can try with the most common reference: \"Principia\".\n\n However, let's look at the function: it requires the work_title. We have to make an educated guess.\n\n Considering the historical context, the book is often referred to as \"Principia\". But to be safe, we can try the full Latin title? But note the function might accept the English version.\n\n How about we try the English title? Because the user is asking in English.\n\n But note: the function doesn't specify. We don't have information about the database.\n\n Since the question is about the law of universal gravitation, and it was published in the Principia, we can use:\n\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n However, the function might not have the exact string. We might try without the special characters? But the function expects a string and we can write the exact string.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the English translation: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\".\n\n But note: the function might have both? We don't know.\n\n We are allowed to make multiple calls? The instruction says: \"you can output multiple function calls in the same TOOLCALL\".\n\n So we can try:\n\n   Call 1: author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n   Call 2: author=\"Isaac Newton\", work_title=\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n\n But note: the function has an optional parameter 'location'. We don't have that, so we can skip it.\n\n However, we are not sure if the function can handle multiple calls and if the system will run both. But the instruction says we can output multiple function calls.\n\n Alternatively, we can try one and then if it fails, try the other? But the system expects all the function calls at once.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". This implies we can have multiple turns? However, in this single turn, we can output multiple function calls.\n\n Let's decide: we try the most common one first? But we can output both at once.\n\n How about we output two function calls? The system will run both and we can see the result.\n\n But note: the system will return the results of both. Then we can choose the one that returns a valid year? But we are only allowed to output the function calls in this turn, and then the system will run them and give the results in the next turn? Actually, the problem says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn\".\n\n So in this turn, we output two function calls. Then the system will run both and return two results. Then in the next turn, we can process the results.\n\n However, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... until you have fulfilled the user's request\". So we are allowed to use multiple turns? But note the example: we are only to output the function calls in this turn.\n\n But the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have the parameters: author and work_title. We are just not sure of the exact work_title.\n\n We are not lacking parameters, we are just uncertain about the value of one parameter.\n\n Therefore, we can try multiple values for work_title.\n\n We'll make two function calls:\n\n   Function call 1: \n        author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n        work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n   Function call 2:\n        author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n        work_title: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\n\n But note: the author name is given as \"Isaac Newton\", so we use that.\n\n However, what if the function expects a specific spelling? We are using the common spelling.\n\n We don't have any other information. So we proceed.\n\n Also note: the function has an optional parameter 'location'. We don't have it, so we omit it.\n\n Let's write the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n Important: the type for the parameters is string.\n\n We are going to output:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"author\" value=\"Isaac Newton\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"work_title\" value=\"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"author\" value=\"Isaac Newton\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"work_title\" value=\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note that the function name is the same for both. That's okay.\n\n But wait, what if there's a common name? We might also try:\n\n   work_title: \"Principia\"\n\n But to avoid too many calls, we stick to the two most likely. Alternatively, we could also try \"Principia Mathematica\" but note that \"Principia Mathematica\" is also the title of a book by Whitehead and Russell, so that might be confusing.\n\n Therefore, we stick to the two above.\n\n However, note that the Latin title might be stored without the special character '\u00e6'. We don't know. But we try the standard form.\n\n Alternatively, we can try without the special character? But we don't know. Let's hope the function can handle it.\n\n We'll make the two calls.\n\n But note: the user's question is about the law of universal gravitation. It is possible that the function might not return the publication year for the entire book but for the specific law?
