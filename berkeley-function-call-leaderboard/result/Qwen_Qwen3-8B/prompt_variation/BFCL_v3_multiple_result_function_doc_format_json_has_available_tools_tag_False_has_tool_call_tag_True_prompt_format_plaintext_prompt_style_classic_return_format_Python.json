The parameters provided by the user are all there: initial_speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2 decimals. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters match the function's requirements.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified the US, I don't need to adjust the region. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. But wait, does the function check sales or just the regular price? The description mentions \"selling price,\" which might include sales. However, there's also the video_games.on_sale function to check if it's on sale. But the user wants the cheapest price, which could be the sale price if it's lower than the regular price. However, the store_price function might already return the current price, which could be discounted. But maybe the user wants to ensure it's the lowest possible, so perhaps checking both the regular price and if it's on sale would be better. However, the functions available don't have a way to get historical prices or compare different sales. The store_price function might return the current price, which could be the lowest available. Alternatively, if the game is on sale, the store_price might return the sale price. So maybe just calling store_price is sufficient. The user didn't mention checking sales, just the cheapest selling price. So I should call video_games.store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'. That should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available unless there's a sale, but the function might already account for that. Alternatively, maybe the on_sale function can check if it's on sale, and then get the price. But the user is asking for the price, not whether it's on sale. So the store_price function is the right choice here. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The required parameters are game_title and platform, which are provided. Region is optional with default US, so including it is optional but the user specified US, so it's safe to include. So the function call would be video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')."}

The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which requires distance and time, and initial_speed is default 0. \n\nWait, the question says the object started from rest, so initial_speed is 0. They want the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's for objects starting from rest. The parameters needed are distance and time. The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. So I can use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is default 0, so no need to specify.
