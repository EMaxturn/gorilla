The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds.

The parameters given in the question are all there: initial_speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. The function doesn't mention needing any other parameters. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_displacement are all required. The user didn't specify rounding, so I can omit that. So I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. \n\nI should check if there's another function needed, but the question is only about displacement.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. It fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, defaults to US). Since the user specified the US, maybe the region parameter isn't needed, but including it would be safe.\n\nWait, the question is about the cheapest price. But the store_price function might return the current price, not necessarily the cheapest. However, if there's a sale, maybe it's the lowest available. But the user might be implying the current price. Alternatively, maybe the on_sale function could check if it's on sale, but the question specifically asks for the price, not whether it's on sale. \n\nSo the best approach is to call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. That should give the current selling price. If there's a sale, that price would be the lowest. The user might be looking for the current price, so that's the function to use. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So the function call should have those parameters. No missing parameters here. \n\nI don't think the store_currency function is needed here because the user isn't asking about the currency, just the price. So the correct tool call is video_games.store_price with the specified parameters."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going if it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the physics formulas here. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The problem mentions constant acceleration, so maybe I can use the equations of motion. The user is asking for the final speed, right?\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's \"calculate_speed_from_rest\" which seems relevant. Let me check its parameters. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0 since the object starts from rest. So I can use this function by plugging in distance=20 and time=4. The function should calculate the final speed using the appropriate formula, probably v = u + at, but since u=0, it's v = at. But they might have used another formula involving distance. Alternatively, maybe they used s = ut + 0.5at\u00b2, which would be s = 0.5at\u00b2, then a = 2s/t\u00b2, and then v = at = 2s/t. Let me check the function's description again. The description says it calculates speed from rest with constant acceleration over distance. So the function probably uses the correct formula. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). The user provided distance=20 and time=4, and initial_speed is 0. So the function call should be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But since initial_speed is optional and the object starts from rest, maybe it's not needed. But to be safe, include it. Alternatively, maybe the function assumes initial_speed is 0 if not provided. But the parameters say initial_speed is required? Wait, no, looking back: the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as required=\"false\". So it's optional. So I can call the function with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But maybe the function can handle initial_speed being omitted. However, since the user specified that the object started from rest, including initial_speed=0 makes it explicit. \n\nSo the correct function call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That should give the final speed. Let me make sure there's no other function needed. The other function is calculate_acceleration, but the user isn't asking for acceleration, just the final speed. So the answer is to call calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}
