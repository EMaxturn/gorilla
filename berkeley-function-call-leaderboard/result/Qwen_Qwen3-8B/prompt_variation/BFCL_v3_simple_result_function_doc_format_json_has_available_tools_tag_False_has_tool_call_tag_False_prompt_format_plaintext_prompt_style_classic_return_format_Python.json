The initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, so since the user specified it's zero, I can include that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so unless they mention a different gravity, I don't need to change that. So the call should include height=150 and initial_velocity=0.

The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The preferences are optional but can include pet_friendly.\n\nThe user specified \"pet friendly\", so I should include that in the preferences array. The location is \"Manhattan, New York\", but the function's location parameter is a string, so that's fine. Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. I should format the date as a string, maybe '2023-03-10' or 'March 10, 2023'. The function's example might expect a specific format, but since it's not specified, I'll use the user's input as is. Wait, the parameters say start_date is a string, so I'll use 'March 10th, 2023' as the value. \n\nWait, but sometimes dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format. However, the user wrote \"March 10th, 2023\", so maybe I should keep it as is unless told otherwise. The function's description doesn't specify the date format, so I'll use the user's exact input. \n\nPreferences: the user mentioned pet_friendly, which is one of the enum options. So the preferences array should include 'pet_friendly'. The other preferences like gym, etc., are optional and not mentioned, so I don't include them. \n\nPutting it all together: location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is \"single\", duration is 3, start_date is \"March 10th, 2023\", and preferences is [\"pet_friendly\"]. \n\nWait, the function's parameters have 'location' as a string, so \"Manhattan, New York\" is correct. The start_date is a string, so \"March 10th, 2023\" is acceptable. The duration is an integer, 3. \n\nI think that's all. Let me check again. The required parameters are all present. The preferences are optional, but since the user specified pet-friendly, it's included. So the function call should be hotel_booking with those parameters."}
