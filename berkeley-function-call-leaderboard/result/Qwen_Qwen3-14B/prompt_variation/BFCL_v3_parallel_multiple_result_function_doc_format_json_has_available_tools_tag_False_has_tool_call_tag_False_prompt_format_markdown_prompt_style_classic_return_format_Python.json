The user wants to fit a linear regression model using data from 'dataset.csv' where x is 'sales' and y is 'future_sales', and also get the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data. The data_loading function can do that. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The file is 'dataset.csv', so file_path is 'dataset.csv'. The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which should be fine here.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to use the linear_regression_fit function. The parameters required are x and y, which are the arrays from the data. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Also, they want residuals, so return_residuals should be True.\n\nWait, but the data_loading function returns the data structure. So first, I need to call data_loading to get the data. Then, extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns from the loaded data. But the functions are supposed to be called in sequence here. However, the user's instruction is to make function calls. So the first call is data_loading, then using the resulting data in the linear_regression_fit.\n\nBut in the tool call format, each function call is separate. So the user's answer would need to first load the data, then fit the model. But the assistant has to output the function calls in order. However, the problem is that the data_loading function's output isn't directly passed to the next function. But according to the task, the assistant should make the necessary function calls. So the correct approach is to first call data_loading with the file path, then use the resulting data to call linear_regression_fit with x and y as the respective columns, and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut the assistant's response should be the list of function calls. So the first function is data_loading, then linear_regression_fit. However, the parameters for linear_regression_fit depend on the data loaded from the first step. But since the functions are called in sequence, the assistant must assume that the data is loaded first. Therefore, the correct function calls are:\n\ndata_loading(file_path='dataset.csv'), then linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], return_residuals=True.\n\nBut the parameters for linear_regression_fit need to have x and y as arrays. The data_loading function's output is a data structure (probably a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame). So assuming that after loading, data['sales'] and data['future_sales'] are the arrays, the parameters are correctly set.\n\nSo the answer should be two function calls: first to load the data, then to fit the model with the specified parameters."}

Then, for the diameter, use getDiameter for Proton and Neutron with unit 'femtometers'. \n\nWait, the parameters require 'particle' and 'unit'.

So I need to call the function twice, once for each sculpture, then calculate the average.\n\nWait, but the function might return the price for each, then I can compute the average. However, the functions available don't have an average function. So the user's question requires two separate calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then compute the average manually. But since the assistant can only call functions, not perform calculations, maybe the answer is to call both functions and then the user would have to average them. But according to the task, I need to make the function calls. So I need to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture.\n\nBut let me check the parameters again.

The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq.
