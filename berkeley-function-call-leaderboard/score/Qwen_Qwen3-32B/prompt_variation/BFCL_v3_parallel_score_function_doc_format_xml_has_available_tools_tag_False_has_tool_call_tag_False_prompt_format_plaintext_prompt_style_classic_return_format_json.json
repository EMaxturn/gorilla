The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers in a specific order. First, they want the HCF of 45 and 60. Then, use that result to find the HCF with 90 and 120. Then, do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, so the first step is to get HCF(45, 60). Let me note that down. The function provided is math.hcf, which takes two integers. So I need to call that function with 45 and 60. Then, take the result from that and use it as one of the numbers in the next HCF calculation with 90 and 120. Hmm, but how exactly? The user says \"use that result to find the HCF with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe the next step is to take the previous HCF result and combine it with 90 and 120? Wait, no. The HCF of three numbers? Or is it the HCF of the previous result with each of the new pair? Let me think. The HCF of two numbers is the highest number that divides both. If you have three numbers, say a, b, c, the HCF can be found by first finding HCF(a, b), then HCF that result with c. So maybe the user wants that approach. So first HCF(45,60) = let's say X. Then HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120)? Or is it HCF(90, 120) and then combine with X? Wait the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So perhaps the next step is to compute HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120)? Or maybe take X and compute HCF(X, 90, 120)? But the function only takes two numbers. So maybe the user wants to first compute HCF(45,60) = X, then compute HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120) separately? Or maybe compute HCF(90, 120) and then compute HCF(X, that result). The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the user's question.\n\nOriginal question: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So \"use that result to find the HCF with another pair\". So perhaps the next step is to take the result X (HCF of 45 and 60) and then find HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120)? Or maybe find HCF of X with the pair (90, 120), which would be HCF(X, 90, 120). But since the function can only take two numbers, maybe the user wants to compute HCF(X, 90) and then HCF that result with 120? Or perhaps the user wants to compute HCF(90, 120) first and then compute HCF(X, that result). The wording isn't entirely clear. But given that the function is for two numbers, I need to make multiple calls. Let's assume that the user wants to compute HCF of (45,60) = X, then compute HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120). Alternatively, maybe compute HCF(90, 120) first, then compute HCF(X, that result). But the user says \"use that result to find the HCF with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\", which suggests that the previous result is used in the next HCF calculation. So perhaps the next step is to compute HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120). But the user might actually want to compute HCF(X, HCF(90, 120)). Let me think. For example, if you have three numbers a, b, c, the HCF can be found by HCF(a, HCF(b, c)). So maybe the user wants to first compute HCF(45,60) = X, then compute HCF(90,120) = Y, then compute HCF(X,Y). But the way the user phrased it is a bit confusing. Let me check the exact wording again: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So \"with another pair of numbers\" implies that the pair is (90, 120), and the previous result is used in the calculation. So perhaps the next step is to compute HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120). But that would give two separate results. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF(X, 90, 120), which would be HCF(HCF(X,90), 120). But since the function can only take two numbers, I need to break it down. So first compute HCF(45,60) = X. Then compute HCF(X, 90) = Y. Then compute HCF(Y, 120) = Z. But the user's instruction isn't entirely clear. However, given the way the question is structured, perhaps the user wants to compute HCF(45,60) and then use that result to compute HCF with 90 and 120. So maybe the next step is to compute HCF(X, 90) and HCF(X, 120). But the user might actually want to compute HCF(90, 120) first, then compute HCF(X, that result). Let me think of an example. Suppose X is 15 (HCF of 45 and 60). Then HCF(90, 120) is 30. Then HCF(15, 30) is 15. Alternatively, if you take X=15 and compute HCF(15,90)=15, then HCF(15,120)=15. So the result would be 15. But the user's instruction is a bit ambiguous.
