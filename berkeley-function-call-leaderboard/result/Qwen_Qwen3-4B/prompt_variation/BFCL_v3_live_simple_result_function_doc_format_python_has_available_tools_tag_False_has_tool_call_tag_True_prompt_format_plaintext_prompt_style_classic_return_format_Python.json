The function's loc parameter expects a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The given address includes the street name, city, state, and ZIP code. But the function's example uses 'Address, City, State' without the ZIP. However, the user's input includes the ZIP, so maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the ZIP is part of the state abbreviation? Wait, CA is the state, and 94704 is a ZIP code. But the function's example uses 'Springfield, IL' which is city and state. So perhaps the function expects just city and state, but the user's input includes the ZIP. Hmm, but the function's parameter description says \"The starting location of the Uber ride in the format of 'Address, City, State'\". So the user's input has \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\" which is Address, City, State, ZIP. But the function's example is '123 Main St, Springfield, IL'. So maybe the ZIP is not part of the required format. But the user's input includes it. However, the function's parameter might not require the ZIP code. Maybe the function can handle it, or maybe it's better to include the full address. But the user's input has the ZIP, so perhaps it's okay. Alternatively, maybe the function expects just the city and state, but the user's input has the full address. But the function's parameter is a string, so maybe it's acceptable to pass the full address as given. So I'll use that as the loc parameter.\n\nThe type is 'Plus' as specified. The time is 10 minutes. So the parameters are loc=\"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\", type=\"Plus\", time=10.

The parameters required are city, and optional ones like cinema_hall, movie_date, movie_language, and movie_format. \n\nThe user specified \"today in Mumbai.\" The city is clearly Mumbai. The date should be today's date in India. Since the function's default for movie_date is the current date, I don't need to specify it unless there's a need to adjust. But the user said \"today,\" so maybe it's safer to include the current date. However, the function already defaults to today, so maybe it's redundant. But since the user explicitly mentioned today, perhaps including it makes it clearer. \n\nWait, the system instruction says to consider the current date as today in India. So the function's default is correct. So I can proceed without specifying the date, but maybe the user wants to ensure it's today. However, the function's default is already today, so it's okay. \n\nThe other parameters: cinema_hall is optional, and the user didn't specify a particular hall.

However, the user didn't mention availability dates, so perhaps the function can handle that. \n\nThe rating is 4.5, which is within the 0.0 to 5.0 range. The has_late_check_in parameter is optional and defaults to False, so unless the user specifies it, we can leave it as default. \n\nPutting it all together, the parameters would be service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', rating=4.5. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date can be omitted since they have default values. \n\nWait, but the function requires the province_id, district_name, and sub_district_name. The user provided all those. So the function call should include those. Let me double-check the parameters. Yes, the function requires service_id, province_id, district_name, sub_district_name, and rating. The other parameters are optional. \n\nSo the correct function call would be getDataForProfessional with service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', rating=4.5. That should retrieve the professionals meeting the criteria."}
