The user wants to modify both their food and drink orders. First, looking at the food part: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be omitted. Special instructions might not be needed here since it's just about removing an ingredient.\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should be a dictionary. The preferences include \"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", and \"milk\": \"almond milk\". So the new_preferences dict would have these key-value pairs.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, which is provided. For ChaDri.change_drink, drink_id and new_preferences are required. The drink_id is given, and new_preferences is a dict with the specified details. Everything seems covered. No missing parameters.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll omit that. No need for recursive or depth parameters here. So, call clone_repo with the provided URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome'. Wait, but the user didn't specify a destination, so the cloned repo's directory might be the same as the repo name. So, I'll use directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\" for analysis.\n\nOnce analyzed, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires directory_name. Again, using the same directory name as the repo. But wait, the analysis might determine the language, which could influence the Dockerfile. However, the function doesn't take the language as a parameter, so maybe it's handled internally. So, call create_a_docker_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name. The other parameters are optional. The user didn't specify deployment_name, image_name, etc., so use defaults. So, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nAfter creating these files, add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name. The commit message and branch aren't specified, so maybe use defaults or leave them out. The user says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which might be handled by the push function automatically adding changes. So, call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nWait, but the steps mention adding changes to Git before committing and pushing. However, the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe the add step is covered by the push function. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which might be redundant if the push function does that. But perhaps the user wants to explicitly add, then commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a 'git add' function. The push function does git add, so maybe that's sufficient. So, proceed with the push function.\n\nSo, the functions to call in order are: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github. Each with the appropriate parameters."}

The get_relevant_classes function seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to true. The search_string should be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The class_name is AbstractCellHandler, and the method_names are setCellValue and getCellValue. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe the include_private parameter should be considered, but since the methods are overridden, they might be public. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe leave include_private as default (false) unless told otherwise.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error about getNumericValue() in CellResult. Maybe CellResult doesn't have that method, so they need to check if there's a related class that does. But the first part of the query is to find classes related to CellResult, so using get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true should help find possible classes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1.

That's straightforward. I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format. The example formats are like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. So I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit parameter is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I can omit it or set a default.
