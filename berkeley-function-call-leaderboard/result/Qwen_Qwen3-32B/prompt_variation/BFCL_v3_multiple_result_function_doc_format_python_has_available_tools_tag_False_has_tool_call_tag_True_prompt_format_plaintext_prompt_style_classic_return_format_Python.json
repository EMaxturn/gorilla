The user is asking for the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds.

The formula should be s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Here, u is initial speed, a is acceleration, t is time.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's kinematics.calculate_displacement which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters match what's needed. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. So I can call that function directly. No need for the final speed function here since the question is about displacement. The rounding is optional, so maybe default to 2 decimals. The answer should be (20*5) + 0.5*10*(5^2) = 100 + 125 = 225 meters. So the function call would be calculate_displacement with those values."}

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are kinematic equations. The question mentions starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. They gave distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed, I think. Or maybe the speed at the end?\n\nLooking at the available functions. There's calculate_acceleration, which needs initial and final speed and time, or distance. But here, we don't know the acceleration or the final speed. The other function is calculate_speed_from_rest, which seems relevant because it starts from rest. Let me check its parameters: distance, time, initial_speed (default 0). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So this function should calculate the speed under constant acceleration over that distance and time. Wait, but what exactly does it return? Maybe the final speed? Or the instantaneous speed at some point? The description says \"the speed of an object that starts from rest under constant acceleration over a specified distance.\" So maybe it's the final speed after traveling that distance. \n\nSo using calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default. That should give the answer. Let me make sure. The formula for speed when starting from rest with constant acceleration over distance d is v = sqrt(2ad), but since a = (v^2)/(2d), but also, using d = 0.5*a*t^2, so a = 2d/t^2. Then substituting into v = a*t, which would be (2d/t^2)*t = 2d/t. Wait, that would be if final speed is v = a*t. But wait, starting from rest, v = a*t, and d = 0.5*a*t^2. So solving for a from d: a = 2d / t^2. Then v = (2d/t^2)*t = 2d/t. So for d=20, t=4, v= (2*20)/4 = 10 m/s. So if the function calculate_speed_from_rest returns that, then the answer is 10 m/s. Therefore, the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but it's the default, so no need to specify. So the tool call should be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)."}

Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function.

Wait, the function's description says \"number of dice to be rolled\". So for two dice, n_rolls would be 2. The desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die is 6 by default, which is standard for dice.
