Let me look at their parameters.\n\nThe uber.ride function requires loc (string, required), type (string, required), and time (integer, required). The user provided all three: loc is the address, type is 'Plus', and time is 10. So that's perfect.\n\nThe uber.ride2 function has a loc parameter but also a type and time. However, the user's request is about finding a ride, not weather. The description for uber.ride2 says it's for finding weather, so maybe it's not the right one here. The user's question is about Uber ride, so uber.ride is the correct function.\n\nSo, I should call uber.ride with the given parameters. The loc is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type is 'Plus', time is 10. All required parameters are present. No missing info here. The other function isn't relevant here.

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the period October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account holder's name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires the bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. But the user provided the account number and name, so maybe that's part of the parameters. However, the transaction overview is a dict, which might be provided by the function. But the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, just the totals. Wait, the user mentioned the beginning and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction overview is calculated based on those numbers.\n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict that includes totals and counts. The user provided the total deposits, total withdrawals, starting and ending balances. So perhaps the function can use those to generate the overview. But the function's parameters require the transaction_overview as a dict, which might be generated by the function itself. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transaction data, so maybe the function can calculate it based on the given numbers.\n\nBut the user also wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires a list of transactions, starting and ending dates, and other parameters like total deposits, withdrawals, etc. However, the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details. They only provided the totals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used with the given totals and the other parameters, but the transactions array is required. Since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, perhaps the function can't be called directly without that data.\n\nWait, the user's question includes the totals, but not the individual transactions. So maybe the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the provided parameters, and then the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters. But the transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array, which isn't provided. So maybe the user expects that the BankStatementOverView function will generate the transaction overview, and then the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters, but without the transactions array, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the BankStatementOverView function is called first to get the transaction overview, and then the transaction_summary.generate is called with the totals and other parameters. But the problem is that the transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array, which isn't available. So perhaps the user's request can't be fully fulfilled with the given information. However, the user might expect that the function can be called with the provided parameters, even if the transactions array isn't provided.\n\nWait, looking at the parameters for transaction_summary.generate, the transactions parameter is an array of individual transaction details. The user hasn't provided that, so maybe the function can't be called. But the user wants a summary, so perhaps the function can be called with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is missing. However, the function's parameters require the transactions array, so that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the BankStatementOverView function is called with the provided parameters, and then the transaction_summary.generate is called with the totals and other parameters, but without the transactions array. But that's not possible because the function requires the transactions array.\n\nHmm. The user's question is a bit ambiguous. They provided the necessary parameters for the BankStatementOverView function (bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction_overview), but the transaction_overview is a dict that the function would generate based on the provided totals. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transaction data, so maybe the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview would be calculated based on the totals. But the function's parameters require the transaction_overview as a dict, which is not provided. So maybe the function can't be called without that data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the transaction_overview is provided by the function, and the rest of the parameters are filled in. But the user hasn't provided the actual transaction data, so the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer would be that the necessary parameters are missing, but the user might need to provide the actual transactions.\n\nBut the user's question includes the totals, so perhaps the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the provided parameters, and the transaction_overview would be generated. Then, the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and other parameters, but without the transactions array. However, the function requires the transactions array, so that's not possible.\n\nIn this case, the user might need to provide the individual transaction details, but since they haven't, the assistant can't call the function. However, the assistant must try to make the function calls based on the given information. So perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is called with the provided parameters, and the transaction_overview is generated, and then the transaction_summary.generate is called with the totals and other parameters, even though the transactions array is missing. But that's not valid because the function requires the transactions array.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters, and then the transaction_summary.generate with the totals and other parameters, but the transactions array is not provided. However, the assistant can't make that call without the transactions array.\n\nTherefore, the assistant can call the BankStatementOverView function with the given parameters, and then the transaction_summary.generate function with the totals and other parameters, but the transactions array is missing. But since the transactions array is required, the assistant can't make that call. Therefore, the answer would be that the necessary parameters are missing, but the assistant can call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters and the transaction_overview as a dict generated from the totals.\n\nBut the user's question requires both the overview and the summary. So the assistant would call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, and then call transaction_summary.generate with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is missing. However, the function requires the transactions array, so that's not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, the assistant can call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters, and then the transaction_summary.generate function with the totals and other parameters, but the transactions array is missing. Therefore, the assistant can make the first call to BankStatementOverView and then the second call to transaction_summary.generate, even though the transactions array is not provided. However, the assistant must include the transactions array in the second call, which is not available. Therefore, the assistant can't make the second call. But the user might expect that the assistant can proceed with the available information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call the transaction_summary.generate function with the provided totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is missing. But the function requires the transactions array, so that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the assistant can only call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters, and the transaction_summary.generate function can't be called because the transactions array is missing. However, the user might need to provide the transactions array, which they haven't. So the assistant can only make the first call."}

The get_show_times function might be more appropriate if they want show times, but the question is about the movies themselves. The get_movies function could retrieve a list of movies in a city, but it requires parameters like cinema hall and date. Since the user hasn't specified a cinema hall, maybe we can omit that. But the function requires city as a required parameter. The user provided the city as Noida, so that's covered.\n\nBut the get_movies function's parameters include movie_date, which is optional. The user said \"today,\" so the movie_date should be set to today's date. The system is supposed to default the movie date to November 4, 2024 in India.

So, the function call would be get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date='4 Nov 2024'.\n\nBut wait, the get_show_times function requires movie_name, which the user hasn't provided. So, maybe the get_show_times isn't the right choice here. The user is asking for the list of movies, not show times.

Since the user wants all MTNA servers, I need to call list_servers with type 'mtna' or 'all' if that's the default. Wait, the description says if no type is specified, all servers are listed. So if I call list_servers without specifying a type, it will return all servers. But the user mentioned \"MTNA servers,\" so maybe the type parameter should be 'mtna' to filter specifically.

So perhaps I should include genre as \"Imax\" and show_type as \"IMAX\" to be specific. \n\nSo the function call would be Movies_1_FindMovies with location \"Danville, VA\" (assuming state abbreviation), theater_name \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", genre \"Imax\", and show_type \"IMAX\". \n\nWait, the user didn't mention the state, but the location is Danville, which is in Virginia (VA) or Kentucky (KY)? Danville, KY is a real city. But the user said \"Danville\" without a state. However, the function requires the location parameter to be in the format \"City, State\". So maybe the user intended Danville, VA or Danville, KY. But since the user didn't specify, maybe we can assume the state is VA or KY. But the function might require the state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants to know what's playing at that theater, so the location is \"Danville, VA\" (assuming VA). \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nMovies_1_FindMovies with location \"Danville, VA\", theater_name \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", genre \"Imax\", show_type \"IMAX\".\n\nBut the user didn't specify the show type, so maybe just genre is enough. However, the function's show_type is optional, so including it might be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the show_type is not needed. But the user is asking for Imax films, which is a genre. So perhaps the genre parameter is \"Imax\" and show_type is \"IMAX\". \n\nSo the final function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"Movies_1_FindMovies\"><params><param name=\"location\" value=\"Danville, VA\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"theater_name\" value=\"Century Blackhawk Plaza\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"genre\" value=\"Imax\" type=\"string\"/></function>\n\nBut I need to check if the parameters are correctly set. The user didn't mention the theater name, but the function allows it to be optional. So including it might help narrow down the results. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with the specified parameters."}

There's a function called RentalCars_3_GetCarsAvailable. Let me check its parameters. The required parameters are city, start_date, pickup_time, end_date. The user provided Portland, OR as the city. The start_date is April 22, 2023, and the end_date is April 27, 2023.

The user specified the start date as April 22, but the function's start_date is for the car rental's start date.

So if the user wants comic movies, they might need to specify the genre as \"comics\" and maybe actors if they have a preference. But the user hasn't mentioned any specific actors. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided specific actors, the starring parameter is optional.

The user wants to play a song, so maybe PlayMedia is the way to go. But they also mentioned looking up songs, so maybe LookupMusic could help find the right track. However, the user hasn't specified a particular track yet. They mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the style Hillbilly from 2019. \n\nThe Music_3_LookupMusic function can retrieve songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The user specified the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the genre as Hillbilly (though the function's parameters say genre is a string, and the user mentioned \"Hillbilly style\".

However, without knowing the exact track, maybe the Lookup function is needed first to find the right track. \n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to play a song from that album and genre, maybe the PlayMedia function can be used with the album and genre. But the PlayMedia function's parameters are track, artist, device, album. So if the user wants to play a song from the album \"Gotta Be Me\" in Hillbilly style, but the function requires a track name. So maybe the user needs to first look up the track using LookupMusic, then play it. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track name yet. So the first step is to use LookupMusic to find songs in the specified album and genre. Then, once the list is retrieved, the user can choose a track and play it. However, the functions here are to be called in sequence. But the user's current request is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the first step is to look up the songs, then play one. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't specified the exact track. So perhaps the LookupMusic function is needed first to get the list, and then PlayMedia to play one. However, the functions can be called in sequence. But the user's question is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic to find the songs and then PlayMedia to play one. But the functions can't be called in sequence here.

I had heard that the album Gotta Be Me is really good.\" So they want to hear a song in Hillbilly style from 2019, and they know the album is \"Gotta Be Me\". \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\n1. Use Music_3_LookupMusic with artist='dontcare', album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Hillbilly', year='2019' to find the songs. \n\n2. Then, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name from the result of the Lookup. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the track name, maybe the Lookup function is the first step. However, the functions can't be called in sequence here. The user's question is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic first to get the list, then PlayMedia with one of the tracks. But the problem is that the functions are to be called in the current turn. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track name, so maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic with the parameters and then PlayMedia with the track from the result.

But the PlayMedia function requires a track name. So without knowing the track name, it's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first use LookupMusic to find the songs, then use PlayMedia to play one. But since the user hasn't provided the track name, the Lookup function is needed first.

However, the user hasn't provided the track name, so the Lookup function would return a list of songs, and then the PlayMedia would need to be called with one of them. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't specified which track, so the assistant can't know which one to play. Therefore, the assistant should first call LookupMusic to find the songs, then use PlayMedia with one of them. However, the assistant can't make multiple function calls in one turn. Wait, the user's question is to \"hear a song\", so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls. \n\nBut the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So perhaps the assistant should first call LookupMusic with the parameters, then in the next turn, call PlayMedia with the track from the result. But the user's question is in one turn. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call both functions in one turn. But the assistant can only make one function call per turn. \n\nWait, the user's message is a single question. The assistant needs to determine which functions to call. Since the user wants to hear a song, the assistant needs to find a track. So the first step is to call LookupMusic with the parameters, then PlayMedia with the track. But since the assistant can only make one function call per turn, perhaps the assistant should call LookupMusic first. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track name, so the assistant can't call PlayMedia without the track. Therefore, the correct approach is to call LookupMusic with the parameters, and then in the next turn, use the result to call PlayMedia. However, the user's question is in one turn, so the assistant must make the necessary function calls. \n\nBut the assistant can't make multiple function calls in one turn. Therefore, the assistant should call LookupMusic first, then in the next turn, call PlayMedia. However, the user's question is to \"hear a song\", so the assistant needs to make the necessary calls. \n\nBut given the constraints, the assistant must make one function call. So perhaps the assistant should call LookupMusic with the parameters, and then in the next turn, call PlayMedia. But the user's question is in one turn. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call PlayMedia with the album and genre, but that's not possible because the function requires a track name. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters artist='dontcare', album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Hillbilly', year='2019' to find the songs, and then in the next turn, use the result to call PlayMedia. But since the user's question is in one turn, the assistant can only make one function call. \n\nBut the user's question is to \"hear a song\", so the assistant needs to find a track. Therefore, the assistant should call LookupMusic first. So the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters as mentioned. Then, the assistant can proceed to play one of the tracks. But since the user hasn't provided the track name, the assistant can't proceed to PlayMedia yet. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should call LookupMusic first.

The date is May 15, 2023, but the journey starts one day before, so the start time would be May 14, 2023. The journey_start_time needs to be in 24-hour format. The user didn't specify the exact time, but maybe they mean the start time is the day before, so maybe 00:00? But the function requires the start time. Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before,\" so the date is May 15, but the journey starts on May 14. The start time is 24-hour format. The user didn't specify the time, so maybe it's 00:00? Or perhaps they want the earliest possible time, but since it's not specified, maybe we can assume 00:00. Also, the user wants business class, so the _class parameter should be \"business\".\n\nThe other parameters: has_laundry_service and rating are not needed here. The user didn't mention them, so they can be omitted. The trip_protection is set to true as required. The number_of_adults is 4. So the function call would include all these parameters. Let me check if all required parameters are present. Yes: _from is Portland, OR; to is Seattle, WA; date_of_journey is May 15, 2023; journey_start_time is 24:00 (assuming 00:00 on May 14); number_of_adults is 4; trip_protection is true. The _class is business. So the function call should be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with these parameters."}

The get_service_providers function seems relevant here. It has parameters for province_id, district_name, start_available_date, and avg_rating.

The available date is March 22nd, 2024, which needs to be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. So the start_available_date would be '2024-03-22 00:00:00'. The avg_rating is for a good reputation, so I'll set avg_rating to a high value, maybe 4.5 or 5.0.

But in the user's question, they mentioned the error rate threshold, but didn't specify the alert_type. So this is a missing parameter. But the user's question is to set up the alert configuration, so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' by default. But the function requires it.

So this is conflicting. Hmm. But the user's question is to set up the alert configuration, so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' or something. Let me check the function again. The function's parameters include alert_type, which is required. So the user must have provided it. But in the question, they didn't. Therefore, this is a problem. However, maybe the user intended to provide the alert_type as 'error_rate' and forgot. But since the user's question doesn't mention it, I can't assume. Therefore, this is a missing parameter. But the user's question is to set up the alert, so perhaps the alert_type is 'error_rate' by default. But the function requires it. So maybe the user's question is incomplete.

Wait, looking back at the function definitions:\n\nThe first function is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which has a user_id parameter. The second function is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, which has parameters include_expired, page, page_size. So the user_id is not a parameter for the second function. Therefore, the user's user ID is not being used here. But the user is asking for all API tokens for their user ID. If the function doesn't have a user_id parameter, then how can we retrieve the tokens? \n\nThis seems like a problem. But maybe the user's user ID is not required, and the function is designed to retrieve all tokens for the current user. However, the user provided their user ID, so perhaps the function is supposed to take user_id as a parameter, but it's not listed here. But according to the given function definitions, it's not. \n\nIn that case, maybe the user's request can't be fulfilled with the given functions. But the user is asking for all API tokens, and the functions available don't have a way to specify the user_id. So perhaps the answer is that the function doesn't have the required parameters. But the user provided their user ID, which is needed. \n\nWait, maybe the user's user ID is not required, and the function is designed to retrieve all tokens for the current user. But the user provided their own ID, so maybe the function is supposed to take user_id as a parameter, but it's not listed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's ID is not needed, and the function is designed to retrieve all tokens for the current user. But the user provided their ID, so perhaps the function is supposed to take it, but it's not in the parameters. \n\nThis is a problem. But given the information provided, the user's user ID is 12345, but the function parameters don't include user_id. Therefore, the function can't be called with the user_id parameter. So the answer would be that the function can't be called with the required parameters. \n\nBut the user is asking for all API tokens. If the function doesn't have a user_id parameter, then perhaps the function is not suitable. Therefore, the correct response is that the function can't be used because the required parameters are missing. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user's user ID is not required, and the function is designed to retrieve all tokens for the current user. But the user provided their ID, so maybe the function is supposed to take it, but it's not in the parameters. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should point out that the required parameters are missing. However, the user's question is to retrieve all API tokens, and the available functions don't have a way to do that. Therefore, the assistant can't call any function. \n\nBut the user's user ID is 12345, which is needed for the function. Since the function doesn't have a user_id parameter, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer is that the function can't be called with the provided parameters."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to check which functions are available to retrieve this information.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's \"detail_experience_and_education\" which retrieves detailed info on experiences and education. The parameters required are \"experience_or_education_type\" and optionally \"experience_or_education_name\". \n\nThe user specified \"education at UNS\", so the type should be \"education\". The name would be \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". So I should call the \"detail_experience_and_education\" function with experience_or_education_type as \"education\" and experience_or_education_name as \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\".\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The function requires \"experience_or_education_type\" as a string, and the name is a string. The other parameters are optional, so they can be omitted if not needed. \n\nAnother function is \"experiences_and_education\", but that seems to be a different name. The user is asking for education, so \"detail_experience_and_education\" is the right choice. \n\nSo the tool call should be to \"detail_experience_and_education\" with the specified parameters."}

The user wants to set a reminder for their meeting tomorrow at 7:00 AM. The date given is 2023-12-1, and the time is 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are set_alarm and set_countdown. The set_alarm function is for setting an alarm with a specific time, including AM/PM. The set_countdown is for a countdown timer, which might not be suitable here since the user wants a reminder, not a countdown.\n\nThe user mentioned \"wake up early for a meeting tomorrow,\" so the alarm makes sense. The date is 2023-12-1, and the time is 7:00 AM. The alarm_time parameter in set_alarm requires a string in a standard format. The user provided the date and time as '2023-12-1 7:00 AM', which fits the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM'. So I can use set_alarm with alarm_time set to '2023-12-01 07:00 AM' and purpose as 'meeting'.\n\nWait, the user said \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which might be a typo. But assuming they meant tomorrow's date, which is 2023-12-01. So the alarm time is 2023-12-01 07:00 AM. The purpose is 'meeting'. So the function call would be set_alarm with those parameters."}
