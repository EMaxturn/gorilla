They mentioned straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the functions available, there's one called calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters. It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. No mention of rounding, so maybe I can omit that or set it to a default. Since the parameters are all there, I can call the calculate_displacement function with those values. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with the given values."}

They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are both given here: 20 meters and 4 seconds. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's optional and the function's description says it starts from rest, maybe it's already handled. So the correct function call would be to calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4."}

So I need to call sort_list with elements as that list and order set to 'asc'. Wait, but the function's order parameter is optional. If I don't specify it, will it default to ascending? The description says \"ascending or descending\", so maybe the default is ascending. But to be safe, maybe include order: 'asc' explicitly. Let me make sure the parameters are correct.

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability, it requires desired_sum and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a sum of 7, so desired_sum is 7. The number of dice rolled is two, but the parameter n_rolls has a default of 1. Wait, the function's n_rolls is the number of dice, right? The description says \"number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\". So since the user is rolling two dice, I should set n_rolls to 2. But wait, the parameter name is n_rolls, which might be the number of rolls, but in this case, each roll is a die. Hmm, maybe the function is designed so that n_rolls is the number of dice. For example, rolling two dice would be n_rolls=2. Then sides_per_die is required. The user didn't specify the type of dice, but standard dice have 6 sides. So sides_per_die should be 6. \n\nSo putting it all together: desired_sum is 7, n_rolls is 2, sides_per_die is 6. The function call should include these parameters. Let me check if all required parameters are present. The required ones are desired_sum and sides_per_die. Yes, both are provided. n_rolls is optional, defaulting to 1, but here we need to set it to 2. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability with those parameters."}

The user provided initial_investment as $20000, which is an integer. The rate is 8%, so that's 0.08 as a float. The time is 5 years.

The month is upcoming, so maybe leave it as default or set it to the current month. But the parameter says the default returns upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is better. Also, they want top-rated, so user_ratings should be set to 'high' or the default, which is 'high'. \n\nWait, the user_ratings parameter's default is 'high', so even if not specified, it would default to that. So the function call would need location as \"New York, NY\", art_form as \"sculpture\", and maybe month as the upcoming month. But the user says \"upcoming month\", which might mean the next month.
