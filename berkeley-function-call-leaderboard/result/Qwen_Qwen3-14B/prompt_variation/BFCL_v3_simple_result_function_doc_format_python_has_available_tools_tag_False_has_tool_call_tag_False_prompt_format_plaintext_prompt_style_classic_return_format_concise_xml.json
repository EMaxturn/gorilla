The progression given is I, V, vi, IV. Let me think about chord progressions in major keys. In a major key, the I is the tonic, V is the dominant, vi is the relative minor, and IV is the subdominant. These chords are all diatonic in a major key. For example, in C major, I is C, V is G, vi is Am, and IV is F. So the progression C-G-Am-F is common in C major. \n\nBut wait, the vi chord is minor.

Let me check the available functions. There's the sports_team.get_schedule function. The parameters needed are team_name, num_of_games, league, and optional location.\n\nThe user specified the team as Manchester United, so team_name is \"Manchester United\". They want the next 6 games, so num_of_games is 6. The league is Premier League. The location isn't mentioned, so I can leave that out. The function allows the league parameter to be optional, but since the user specified it, I should include it. \n\nWait, the function's league parameter says if not provided, it fetches all games regardless of league. But the user wants specifically Premier League games. So I need to set league to \"Premier League\". \n\nSo the function call should have team_name, num_of_games, and league. Location is optional and not provided, so it's omitted. Let me structure the parameters correctly. The types are team_name (str), num_of_games (int), league (str). All set. I think that's all the required parameters. No missing info here. The user provided all necessary details. So the function call should be made with those parameters."}

So I need to call find_recipe with those values. The default for maxCalories is 1000, but the user specified less than 500, so setting maxCalories to 500 makes sense here.
