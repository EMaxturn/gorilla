The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user specified a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires the foodItem name. Since they're changing to a Caesar salad, foodItem should be \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients would be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients mentioned, so newIngredients isn't needed. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they just removed anchovies, maybe that's covered under removeIngredients. So the ChaFod call would be foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user mentions updating order 123. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences are large, hot coffee, regular sweetness, and almond milk. So new_preferences should be a dictionary with those details. The keys might be things like size, temperature, sweetness, milk_type. So the parameters would be drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nWait, the function's new_preferences is a dict, so I need to structure it properly. The user specified \"large hot coffee\" which might translate to size and temperature. \"Regular sweetness\" is sweetness level, and \"almond milk\" is the milk type. So the dictionary should include those keys. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required. For ChaDri, drink_id and new_preferences are required. Both are provided. So both functions can be called."}

The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll omit that. No need for recursive or depth parameters here. So the first function call is clone_repo with the provided URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory name is likely 'nodejs-welcome'. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'. This will determine the predominant language, which is probably Node.js given the repo name.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires directory_name. Using the same directory name as before, 'nodejs-welcome', so call that function with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name. Again, 'nodejs-welcome'. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., aren't specified, so use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nNext, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'. The commit_message and branch_name aren't provided, so leave them out. Force push isn't mentioned, so default to false.\n\nWait, but the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push function automatically git adds changes, so maybe after creating the files, we need to push. But the steps mention adding changes, then commit/push. However, the push function handles adding, committing, and pushing. So maybe after creating the files, call push_git_changes_to_github with a commit message. But the user didn't specify the message, so perhaps leave it as default or omit. The function allows commit_message as optional. So the final step is to push with the directory name.\n\nPutting it all together, the functions to call in order are clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and push_git_changes_to_github.

The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'.\n\nThe user is asking two main things: find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and get the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult', the appropriate function is get_relevant_classes. The search string should be 'CellResult', and since they want to include subdirectories, set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, for the method signatures, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function is needed here. However, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler', so the methods are in the parent class. But the user is overriding them, so they need to check the parent class's methods. Wait, the user is trying to override methods in 'AbstractCellHandler', but the error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' is a class that's being used in the methods, and the method 'getNumericValue()' is missing there. But the user's main request is about the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo, for the method signatures, they need to call get_signature for each method. For 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. However, the function requires class_name, method_name, and optionally include_private. Since the user is overriding these methods, they need to ensure the signatures match. So, they should call get_signature for each method.\n\nWait, but the user is getting an error about 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' is a class that's supposed to have that method, but it's missing. However, the user's question is about finding classes related to 'CellResult' and the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler'.

I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size=5.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format. The example formats are like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. So I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe we can omit it or default to a common unit like Celsius. However, since the unit isn't required, perhaps just providing the location is enough. So call get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore'.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\" without a comma. But the function's example includes the city and country with a comma. So I should make sure to format it correctly. The user might have meant Queenstown, Singapore, so the location parameter should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'.\n\nSo both functions are needed here. The parameters are provided for both.
