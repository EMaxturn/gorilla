The function's parameters include city (required), cinema_hall (optional), movie_date (optional with default current date), movie_language (optional), and movie_format (optional). Since the user didn't specify any other filters, I'll just provide the city and the current date. Wait, the default for movie_date is already the current date, so maybe including it isn't necessary, but the user explicitly said \"today,\" so better to include it to be safe. So the function call should have city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to today's date. But how do I get today's date? The system is supposed to calculate it, so in the function call, I can set movie_date to the current date in India. Let me check the function's parameters again. The movie_date is a string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, optional, default is current date. So even if I don't include it, it would default to today. But since the user specified \"today,\" including it makes the query more precise. However, the function's default is already today, so maybe it's redundant. But to ensure clarity, perhaps include it. Wait, the user might be in a time zone where today's date is different, but the system is supposed to calculate it. So the function call should have city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to the current date in India. But how to represent the current date? Since the system will handle that, maybe I just need to include the parameter with the current date. But in the function call, the value should be a string in the correct format. So I'll set movie_date to today's date in India. Let me confirm the current date. Assuming today is October 25, 2023, then the date would be 2023-10-25. But since the system will calculate it, maybe I don't need to specify it. Wait, the function's description says the default is the current date. So if the user says \"today,\" the default is already correct. Therefore, the function call only needs the city parameter. But to be safe, maybe include the movie_date as today's date. However, the user might not have specified a date, but the function's default is current date. So the correct function call is get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\". The other parameters are optional and not provided. So the final function call is get_movies with city set to Mumbai and movie_date as today's date. Wait, but the user didn't specify the date, but the question is \"today,\" so the system should use the current date. Therefore, the function call should include city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to today's date. But since the function's default is today, maybe it's redundant. However, the user explicitly mentioned \"today,\" so including it ensures that the query is accurate. So I'll proceed with both parameters."}
