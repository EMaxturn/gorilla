It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and an optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. There's no mention of rounding, so I can omit that. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_displacement are all integers. The user's inputs are all integers, so that's fine.

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are given here as 20 meters and 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest, so initial_speed might be set to 0 by default. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed isn't needed here because it's already accounted for in the function's logic. \n\nAlternatively, the other function calculates acceleration, but the user wants speed. So the correct function here is calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires distance (integer) and time (integer). The user provided 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. So that's all set. \n\nI should call kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4.
