The function is designed to find theatres for a specific movie, but since it takes an array of movies and times, it might handle multiple.\n\nThe function description says: \"Find local movie theatres and their schedule for a specific movie\", but the params allow for an array of movies and times. So, I can pass multiple.\n\nThe user asked for two theatres, but the function doesn't have a parameter for the number of theatres; it will just return what's available.\n\nTo fulfill the request, I should call this function with the provided details.\n\nParameters I need to prepare:\n\n- location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n\n- movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]  // as an array\n\n- time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]  // as an array, assuming the order corresponds, but the function might not specify pairing.\n\nThe function doesn't specify how the arrays are paired.

For New York, NY: location = \"New York, NY\", facilities = [\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction section\"]\n\n2. For Los Angeles, CA: location = \"Los Angeles, CA\", facilities = [\"Wi-Fi\", \"Children Section\"]\n\n3. For Chicago, IL: location = \"Chicago, IL\", facilities = [\"Cafe\", \"Reading Room\"]\n\nThat covers all the requirements.\n\nThe function name is \"public_library.find_nearby\", and I need to use it for each.\n\nI should ensure the parameters are correctly formatted.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY be the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array. No other text.\n\nSo, the JSON structure:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"public_library.find_nearby\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"location\": \"New York, NY\",\n\n      \"facilities\": [\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction section\"]\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"public_library.find_nearby\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"location\": \"Los Angeles, CA\",\n\n      \"facilities\": [\"Wi-Fi\", \"Children Section\"]\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"public_library.find_nearby\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\",\n\n      \"facilities\": [\"Cafe\", \"Reading Room\"]\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nThat seems correct."}
