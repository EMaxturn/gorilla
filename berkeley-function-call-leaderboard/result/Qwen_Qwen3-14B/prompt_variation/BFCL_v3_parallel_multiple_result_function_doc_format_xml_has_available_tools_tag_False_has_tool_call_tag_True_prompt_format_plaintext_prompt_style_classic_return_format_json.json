The user wants to fit a linear regression model using data from dataset.csv. They specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], and also want the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data. The data_loading function can handle that. The file path is dataset.csv. The parameters for data_loading are file_path and delimiter. The user didn't mention a delimiter, so maybe it's the default, which is usually a comma. So I'll call data_loading with file_path set to \"dataset.csv\".\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y arrays. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Assuming that after loading, the data is stored in a variable called 'data', I can extract those arrays. Also, they want the residuals, so return_residuals should be true.\n\nWait, but the functions are separate. So first, I need to load the data. Then, use the loaded data to get x and y for the linear regression. So the steps are: call data_loading first, then use the output to call linear_regression_fit with the appropriate parameters and return_residuals set to true.\n\nBut in the function calls, I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The data_loading function returns the data structure, which would then be used to extract 'sales' and 'future_sales' as x and y. However, in the function calls, I can't directly reference the data after loading unless the system handles that. But according to the problem statement, I just need to make the function calls in order. So first, load the data, then fit the model using the loaded data's columns.\n\nSo the first function call is data_loading with file_path \"dataset.csv\". The second function call is linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True. But how does the system handle the data variable? It's assumed that after data_loading, the data is available for subsequent functions. So the parameters for linear_regression_fit would use the data from the loaded file.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is to first load the data, then fit the model. The parameters for the linear regression would be the columns as specified. Also, return_residuals is set to true as per the user's request."}

The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures in different museums. The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it retrieves the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size as an array. \n\nFor the first sculpture: Philadelphia museum, material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. So the size array would be [4,4]. For the second, New York museum, bronze, size 6x3, so [6,3]. \n\nBut wait, the function might need the size in a specific format. The description says dimensions, so maybe it's [height, width, depth]? But the user provided two dimensions, so maybe it's 2D? The function's parameter says array, so maybe just the two numbers. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the user is asking for the average price of both. But the function get_artwork_price returns the price of a sculpture based on those parameters. So I need to call the function twice, once for each sculpture, then calculate the average. \n\nBut the functions available don't have a way to calculate an average. The user is asking for the average of two prices. So first, I need to get each price individually. \n\nSo first call get_artwork_price for Philadelphia, marble, [4,4]. Then call it again for New York, bronze, [6,3]. Then average the two results. But since the functions can't do the average, the user would have to do that. But the assistant can't perform calculations, only call functions. So the answer would be to call both functions and then the user can average them. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the average. So the assistant needs to get both prices and then compute the average. However, the functions only return the price of each sculpture. So the assistant would need to make two separate calls and then combine the results. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price twice with the respective parameters. Then, once both prices are obtained, compute the average. But since the assistant can't perform calculations, it's up to the user. However, the user's question is to find the average, so the assistant must first retrieve both prices. \n\nTherefore, the function calls needed are two instances of get_artwork_price with the respective parameters."}

Parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. The first three are given. The compound_freq is annually, which is once per year, so 1. But the parameter is optional, so maybe it's okay to include it.\n\nThird option: Initial investment of $3000 at 5% for 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function future_value is required here. Parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The interest rate given is 5%, so 0.05 as a decimal. Time is 6 years. Num_compoundings is twice a year, so 2. All parameters are present.\n\nWait, for the future_value function, the interest_rate is a decimal, so 5% becomes 0.05.
