The parameters required are all provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2 decimals. So I should call that function with those values. I don't need the final speed here, so the other function isn't necessary. All parameters are present, so the function call should work."}

The other functions like store_currency and on_sale don't seem necessary here since the question is specifically about the price. No missing parameters, so the function call should be straightforward."}

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions. There's 'calculate_acceleration' which requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and optionally distance. But we don't know the final speed here, which is what we need to find. Wait, but the user is asking for the final speed, not acceleration. \n\nThen there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). The description says it calculates speed starting from rest under constant acceleration. That sounds exactly like the scenario here. The required parameters are distance and time, which are provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. So I should use this function. The initial_speed is 0 by default, which matches starting from rest. \n\nSo the correct function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed."}

All parameters are present, so I can call the function with these values. No need for calculate_mass here since the question doesn't mention molar mass or mass calculation.

Since they're rolling two dice, n_rolls is 2. So I should call the function with desired_sum=7, sides_per_die=6, and n_rolls=2. That should compute the probability correctly.

The get_bureau_statistics and get_demographics might not be the right fit here because the question is specifically about population categories, and veterans are listed under the population category examples. \n\nSo, the function should be get_population. The parameters required are year and category. The year is 1954, and the category is 'veterans'. I need to make sure both parameters are included.

Yes, initial_investment, rate_of_return, and years are all there. The function doesn't require anything else. So the correct call would be finance.calculate_future_value with those values.
