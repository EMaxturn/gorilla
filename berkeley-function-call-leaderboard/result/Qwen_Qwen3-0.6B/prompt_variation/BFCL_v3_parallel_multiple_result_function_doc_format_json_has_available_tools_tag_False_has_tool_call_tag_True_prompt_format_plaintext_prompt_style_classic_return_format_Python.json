The 'game_score.highest' function needs game, platform, and region. Game is Fortnite, platform is PlayStation, region Asia. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The 'lawsuit_details.find' function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user mentioned Apple Inc. and year 2018, so company_name='Apple Inc.', year=2018. The case_type isn't specified, so it defaults to all.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The 'calculate_binomial_probability' function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So all parameters are present, so that's the function call.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For each function, check if all required parameters are there. For example, in 'get_collectables_in_season', required are game_name, season, item_type. The user provided all. Similarly for the others. So each function call should be made with the correct parameters."}
