The data_loading function can do that. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The file is dataset.csv, so file_path is \"dataset.csv\". The delimiter is defaulting to comma, which should be fine unless specified otherwise. So I'll call data_loading with file_path as \"dataset.csv\".\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the x and y variables. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Assuming that after loading, the data structure has these keys. Then, I'll use the linear_regression_fit function with those x and y arrays. Also, the return_residuals parameter needs to be set to true since the user wants the residuals.\n\nWait, but the functions are in a sequence. First, load the data, then fit the model. So the steps are: call data_loading, then use the resulting data in the linear_regression_fit. But in the tool calls, I need to make sure that the output from data_loading is passed correctly. However, the functions here are separate, so maybe the user expects two separate calls. But the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as lists. So the process is: first load the data, then extract x and y from the loaded data, then call the fit function with those lists and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the current setup, the assistant can only make function calls. So the first step is to load the data. Then, assuming that the data is loaded into a variable, the next step would be to call the linear regression fit with the appropriate parameters. However, the assistant needs to generate the function calls in order. So the first function call is data_loading, then the second is linear_regression_fit using the data from the first call.\n\nBut the user's question requires both steps. So the assistant should generate both function calls in sequence. The parameters for the linear_regression_fit would be x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True. However, the data is loaded via the data_loading function, so the x and y would be derived from that loaded data.

So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price. But the function parameters require the size as a list. The user's input has \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\".

The user has four separate requests here. First, they want to know the collectable fish in Animal Crossing during Summer. The function get_collectables_in_season seems right for that. I need to specify the game name, season, and item type as 'fish'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in Fortnite on Playstation in Asia. The game_score.highest function can handle that. Parameters would be game: 'Fortnite', platform: 'Playstation', region: 'Asia'.\n\nThen, lawsuits involving Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function is the one to use here. Company name is 'Apple Inc.', year 2018. The case_type isn't specified, so I'll leave it out or set it to default.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials=10, number_of_successes=3, probability_of_success=0.7.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped and that each function is called in order. Let me check each parameter again to avoid mistakes."}
