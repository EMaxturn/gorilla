The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers and then use those results to find more HCFs. Let me break down each part.\n\nFirst, they asked for the HCF of (45, 60). I'll use the math.hcf function for that. The parameters are number1=45 and number2=60. So that's the first function call.\n\nNext, take the result from the first HCF and find the HCF with another pair (90, 120). Wait, the result of the first HCF is needed here. Let me compute the first one first. The HCF of 45 and 60 is 15. Then, I need to find the HCF of 15 with 90 and 120. Wait, no, the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". Hmm, maybe they mean take the result from the first HCF (which is 15) and then find the HCF of that result with the pair (90, 120)? Or is it the HCF of the first result with each of 90 and 120? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe user says: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe after getting the HCF of 45 and 60 (which is 15), then find the HCF of 15 with 90 and 120? Or is it the HCF of the pair (90, 120) using the previous result? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe they want the HCF of (45,60) and then the HCF of (90,120), and then take those two results and find their HCF? Or perhaps the HCF of the first result with the second pair. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nThe user says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So \"that result\" refers to the HCF of (45,60), which is 15. So the next step is to find the HCF of 15 (the result of the first step) and the pair (90, 120). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the HCF of the numbers. Let me rephrase the question. The user is asking for the HCF of the numbers.
