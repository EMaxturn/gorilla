The user's request is about finding a ride, so 'uber.ride' seems relevant. The parameters needed are loc, type, and time. The user provided the location, the type is 'Plus', and the time is 10 minutes. The 'uber.ride2' function has a time parameter with a default of 10, but the user specified 10, so maybe it's redundant. However, the 'uber.ride' function's parameters require loc, type, and time. The user's location is given as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits the format. The type is 'Plus' as specified. Time is 10 minutes. So the correct function to call is 'uber.ride' with those parameters.

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these details.\n\nThe user mentioned the account number, bank name, account type (checking), and full name. The transaction_overview includes total deposits, withdrawals, start and end dates. The user also provided the beginning and ending balances, which might be needed for the overview. But the transaction_overview parameters don't include starting and ending balances. Wait, the transaction_overview's properties have start_date and end_date, which the user provided. So maybe the transaction_overview is the summary of the transactions, including the totals and dates.\n\nSo, the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the provided details. The parameters would be bank_name: \"U.S. Bank\", account_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\", account_type: \"checking\", full_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction_overview would include total_deposits: 7132.76, total_withdrawals: 5927.40, start_date: \"2019-10-01\", end_date: \"2019-10-31\". The user also provided the starting and ending balances, but maybe those are part of the transaction_overview or the overview itself. The function's description says it provides an overview including account info and transaction summary. So the transaction_overview is the summary, and the overview includes the account details.\n\nAnother thing: the user wants a summary of transactions, which the transaction_summary.generate function might handle. But looking at the functions, the transaction_summary.generate requires transactions (an array of individual transactions), starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and names. However, the user hasn't provided individual transaction details, just the totals. So maybe the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is sufficient for the summary. But the user might need the summary generated from the transaction_overview data.\n\nBut the user's question asks for both an overview and a summary. However, the available functions might not have a separate summary function. The BankStatementOverView provides the overview, and the transaction_overview is part of it. The user might need to use the BankStatementOverView function to get the overview and then maybe the transaction_summary.generate if they have the individual transactions. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe the BankStatementOverView is the main function to call here.\n\nSo the steps are: call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. The transaction_overview would be the summary of the transactions, which includes the totals and dates. The user's provided details for deposits and withdrawals are part of the transaction_overview. The account details are provided, so that's covered. The function should return the overview, which includes the transaction summary. Therefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the specified parameters."}

The get_show_times function needs city, movie_name, movie_date, and others. The user is asking about movies in Noida, so the city is Noida. They mentioned \"today,\" so the movie_date should be today's date in India, which is November 4, 2024. The user didn't specify the language or format, so the defaults for those parameters should be used. The get_movies function has a default for movie_language as Hindi and movie_format as 2D. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention any specific language or format, so using the defaults makes sense. The get_show_times function requires movie_name, which the user hasn't provided. So that function isn't suitable here because we don't have the movie name. Therefore, the get_movies function is the right choice. \n\nSo, I should call get_movies with city='Noida', movie_date='4 Nov 2024', and use the defaults for the other parameters.

But the user might want all technologies, so maybe I should set include_tools to True? However, the user didn't specify, so maybe the default is sufficient. But the problem is, the function's default for include_tools is False. The user didn't mention tools, so perhaps it's better to leave it as default. \n\nSo the function call would be get_tech_stack with employee_id=\"Adriel\" and as_of_date defaulting to current date. The other parameters can be left as default. So the correct function call is get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\"."}

{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to find restaurants in New York that are tagged as intermediate priced and have outdoor seating. First, I need to check which functions are available. There's Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants which takes category, location, and optional parameters like price_range and has_seating_outdoors.\n\nThe category should be 'Intermediate' but looking at the enum for the category parameter, the options include 'moderate' as a default. Wait, the user mentioned 'intermediate priced', but the enum for category includes 'moderate' as a possible value. So maybe the category parameter is named 'price_range' instead of 'category'? Wait, no, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' as a required parameter, and 'price_range' as an optional parameter. The enum for category is listed as 'Mexican', 'Bistro', etc., but the price_range is a separate parameter with enum values like 'cheap', 'moderate', 'pricey', 'ultra high-end'.\n\nWait, the user wants intermediate priced. So the price_range should be 'moderate' since that's the default, but the user specified 'intermediate' which might not be in the enum. However, the user says 'intermediate priced', and the price_range enum includes 'moderate' as a default. So maybe the user is referring to 'moderate' as intermediate. But the user might have a typo. However, the function's parameters have 'price_range' as an optional parameter with enum values, so the user can set it to 'moderate' to get intermediate priced.\n\nAlso, the user wants outdoor seating, so the has_seating_outdoors parameter should be set to True. The location is New York, so the location parameter is 'New York, NY' (since the format is 'City, State' and state is abbreviated).\n\nSo the function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with category as 'American' (but wait, the category is part of the enum, but the user didn't specify a category. Wait, the user didn't mention a specific category, just that they want intermediate priced. So maybe the category is not specified, but the price_range is set to 'moderate'. Wait, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants require 'category' and 'location'. The user didn't specify a category, but the price_range is an optional parameter. So perhaps the category is not required, but the user wants to find restaurants in New York with price_range 'moderate' and has_seating_outdoors True.\n\nWait, looking back at the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants: the required parameters are 'category' and 'location'. The user didn't specify a category, but the price_range is an optional parameter. So maybe the category is not provided, but the price_range is set to 'moderate' to get intermediate priced. However, the 'category' parameter is required, so the user must provide a category. But the user didn't specify a category. Hmm, this is a problem. The user's request is to find restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced, but the function requires a category.

So perhaps the user can set the price_range to 'moderate' to get intermediate priced, and the category is not required. But the function's parameters require 'category' and 'location'. So the user must provide a category. But the user didn't specify one. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the user's question is to find restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced. The function's parameters include 'category' and 'price_range'. The 'category' is an enum, and 'price_range' is an optional parameter. So maybe the user wants to set the price_range to 'moderate' (assuming 'moderate' is intermediate) and the category is not specified. But the function requires 'category' as a required parameter. So perhaps the user's request is to find restaurants in New York with price_range 'moderate' and has_seating_outdoors True. But the category is required.

But the user's request is to find restaurants with intermediate price, so maybe the category is not specified, and the function can be called with price_range 'moderate' and has_seating_outdoors True. But the function requires 'category' and 'location'. So the user must provide a category. Since the user didn't specify one, perhaps the function can't be called.

The user wants to hear a song in the Hillbilly style from 2019 and mentioned that the album \"Gotta Be Me\" is really good. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia, Music_3_LookupMusic, and Weather_1_GetWeather. Since the user wants to play a song, Music_3_PlayMedia is the right choice. But wait, the user hasn't specified a particular track or artist yet. They mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the style Hillbilly, but the function parameters for Music_3_PlayMedia require a track title. \n\nHmm, the user hasn't provided the exact track name. The function requires 'track' as a required parameter. So maybe I need to use Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs that fit the criteria. The user specified Hillbilly style and 2019, and the album \"Gotta Be Me\". \n\nLooking at Music_3_LookupMusic's parameters: it allows filtering by genre, year, and album. The genre here would be 'Hillbilly' (but the enum for genre includes 'Hillbilly'? Wait, the enum for genre in the function is ['Reggae', 'Holiday', 'Electropop', 'Pop', 'Asia', 'House', 'Electronica', 'Funk', 'Rock', 'Metal', 'Dubstep', 'Country', 'dontcare']. Oh, 'Hillbilly' isn't listed. So maybe the user's request is for Country music, which is in the enum. But the user said Hillbilly style. Maybe they meant Country? Or perhaps the function can handle it with 'dontcare' for the genre. \n\nThe user also mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\". So in the Lookup function, the 'album' parameter can be set to 'Gotta Be Me'. The 'year' is 2019. \n\nSo using Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country' (assuming that's the closest match), album 'Gotta Be Me', and year 2019. Then, once I have the track names, I can use Music_3_PlayMedia to play them. But the user hasn't specified which track to play. \n\nWait, the user says \"I want to hear a song. I'm in the mood for Hillbilly style from 2019. I had heard that the album Gotta Be Me is really good.\" So they want to play a song from that album in the Hillbilly style. But the function parameters for LookupMusic don't have a way to specify the style directly. The genre parameter is in the enum, but 'Hillbilly' isn't there. So maybe the user is referring to Country music, which is in the enum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific track, but they didn't mention it. So perhaps the best approach is to use LookupMusic to find songs from the album \"Gotta Be Me\" in the Country genre (assuming that's the closest match) and then play one of them. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track name, so the PlayMedia function can't be called without the track. Therefore, the correct approach is to first use LookupMusic to get the track names and then use PlayMedia to play them. However, the user might expect a direct call. \n\nWait, the user's request is to \"hear a song\" so maybe they just want to play a song from that album. But without the track name, the PlayMedia function can't be called. So the answer would be to use LookupMusic to find the tracks and then use PlayMedia. But the system requires function calls. \n\nSo the assistant needs to call LookupMusic with the parameters: genre as 'Country' (assuming Hillbilly is a typo or misinterpretation), album 'Gotta Be Me', year 2019. Then, once the tracks are found, use PlayMedia with the track name. But since the user hasn't provided the track name, maybe the assistant can't proceed. However, the user might have intended to specify a track, but it's not in the query. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call LookupMusic with the given parameters and then use the returned tracks to call PlayMedia. But the system requires function calls in the response. So the assistant should first call LookupMusic and then PlayMedia. But the user's question is to \"hear a song,\" so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls. \n\nGiven that, the assistant should first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters: genre 'Country' (assuming that's the closest match), album 'Gotta Be Me', year 2019. Then, once the tracks are retrieved, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name. But since the track name isn't provided, the assistant can't proceed. However, the user might have intended to provide a track, but it's not in the query. \n\nWait, the user says \"I'm in the mood for Hillbilly style from 2019. I had heard that the album Gotta Be Me is really good.\" So maybe the user wants to play a song from that album in the Hillbilly style, but since the genre isn't in the enum, perhaps the assistant should use the Lookup function with genre 'Hillbilly' even though it's not in the enum. But the enum doesn't include 'Hillbilly', so that's not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might have to use the Lookup function with genre 'Country' and album 'Gotta Be Me', and then assume that the user wants one of the tracks from that album. Then, the assistant can call PlayMedia with the track name. But without the track name, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call LookupMusic with the given parameters and then PlayMedia with the track name. But since the track name isn't provided, the assistant can't make the PlayMedia call. However, the user's request is to \"hear a song,\" so the assistant must make the necessary function calls. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should first call LookupMusic with the parameters: genre 'Country' (assuming that's the intended genre), album 'Gotta Be Me', year 2019. Then, once the tracks are retrieved, use PlayMedia with the track name. But since the track name isn't provided, the assistant can't proceed.

The default for retry_count is 3, but the user specified 5, so I need to include that. The default for auth_required is True, but the user says it requires authentication, so that's already covered.\n\nSo I need to call add_service_config with service_name 'fdsa' and configurations including timeout=30, retry_count=5, endpoint, and auth_required=True. The other parameters like environment and user_id are not needed here since the user didn't mention them. The function's parameters don't require those, so I can ignore them.\n\nWait, the 'configurations' property in the function has a default for auth_required, but the user explicitly says it requires authentication, so setting it to True is correct. The endpoint is a string, which the user provided. So the function call should include all the required parameters. Let me check the parameters again: the 'configurations' is a dict with timeout, retry_count, endpoint, auth_required. All the user's specs are covered here.\n\nSo the function call would be add_service_config with service_name 'fdsa' and configurations with the specified values. No other functions are needed here. The other functions like get_service_configs or order_service_config aren't relevant for this task."}

The parameters are integers, and the user provided February 15th, 2022. So month would be 2 (since February is the second month), day is 15, year is 2022. That should work.\n\nAnother function is 'get_hosts_per_month', but that needs month and year, but the user is asking for a specific day, not the entire month. So 'get_hosts_per_day' is the right choice here. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly set. Day is 15, month is 2, year is 2022. No other parameters are needed.

The user ID is provided, so I need to use one of these. The get_api_tokens function retrieves tokens associated with the user's account, and get_shareable_api_tokens does the same but for custom dashboards. Since the user didn't mention anything about custom dashboards, maybe get_api_tokens is the right choice. But the parameters require user_id and include_expired. The user didn't specify if they want expired tokens, but the default is False. So I should call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to False unless specified otherwise. Wait, the user didn't mention expired tokens, so default is okay. So the function call would be api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=False. But the user might need all tokens, including expired. However, since the default is False, maybe it's safe to use the default. Alternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, so perhaps include_expired should be True. But the problem is the user didn't specify, so maybe the default is acceptable. The function's parameters have include_expired as a boolean with default False. So the call would be to get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=False. That should retrieve the list of API tokens for the user. The other function, get_shareable_api_tokens, is for custom dashboards, which the user didn't mention, so probably not needed here. So the correct function call is get_api_tokens with the given user_id."}

The parameters required are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled. The alert_type has an enum with 'error_rate', so that's set. Threshold is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. Recipients are an array of strings. Enabled is default True, so maybe not needed but included anyway.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention enabled, but the default is True. So maybe it's okay to omit that. Let me check the parameters again. The required fields are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. Enabled is optional with default True.

The user didn't specify any particular parameters, so maybe default values are okay. The other function is for getting shareable tokens, which isn't what the user needs here. The 'get_shareable_api_tokens' function has a 'include_revoked' parameter, but the user didn't mention revoked tokens. \n\nSince the user wants all tokens, I should call the 'get_api_tokens' function.

The parameters include 'experience_or_education_type' and 'experience_or_education_name'. The enum for the type includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. \n\nSo, the user specifically mentioned \"education at UNS\", which matches the enum value. The function requires 'experience_or_education_type' to be set to that enum value.

But the default for 'experience_or_education_name' is 'Not specified', so maybe that's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to specify the institution, but the function's parameters allow for that.

The user wants to set a reminder to wake up early for a meeting tomorrow at 2023-12-1 at 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's set_alarm and set_countdown. The user is asking for a reminder, so set_alarm seems appropriate. The parameters for set_alarm include alarm_time, which can be in various formats. The user provided the date as 'tomorro 2023-12-1', but that's not a valid date. Wait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is probably a typo. They meant 'tomorrow' as in the next day. So the date should be 2023-12-02 if today is 2023-12-01. But the user might have intended 'tomorrow' as the date. However, the function requires the alarm_time in a specific format. The example given for set_alarm includes 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM' with AM/PM. So the user's request is to set an alarm for 7:00 AM tomorrow. The date part is ambiguous. But the user says \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which might be a typo for 'tomorrow' (2023-12-02). But the function's alarm_time parameter expects a string in the format like 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM' with AM/PM. So the user's request is to set the alarm for 7:00 AM tomorrow. The date part is unclear, but the user might have intended the date as 2023-12-02. However, the user might have made a typo. But since the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", maybe they meant the date is 2023-12-1, but that's a day before tomorrow. Alternatively, maybe they meant the date is 2023-12-01, and the alarm is for 7:00 AM tomorrow. But the function's alarm_time parameter requires a specific date. So perhaps the user intended the date as 2023-12-01 and the alarm is for 7:00 AM. But the user said \"tomorrow\", so the date would be 2023-12-02. However, the user's input is a bit unclear. But the function's alarm_time can take a date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM' with AM/PM. So the user's request is to set an alarm for 7:00 AM tomorrow. The date part is ambiguous, but the user might have intended the date as 2023-12-02. So the alarm_time would be '2023-12-02 07:00:00' if the time is 7:00 AM. But the user didn't specify the exact date, but the date part is 'tomorrow' which is 2023-12-02. So the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-02 07:00:00' and purpose as 'meeting'. Alternatively, if the user meant the date is 2023-12-1, but that's a day before tomorrow, but that's not likely. So the correct function call is set_alarm with the alarm_time as '2023-12-02 07:00:00' and purpose 'meeting'. The parameters are required, so the alarm_time is provided. The purpose is optional but given as 'meeting'. So the function call would be set_alarm with the alarm_time in the correct format."}
