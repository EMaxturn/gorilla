The function's loc parameter expects a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The given address includes the street name, city, state, and ZIP code.

I need to check the available functions to see which one can handle this request.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city name and a date. The date has a default value of '2019-03-01', but the user specified April 25th, 2023. So I need to set the date parameter to '2023-04-25' and the city to 'Foster City'. \n\nThe function parameters are city (str) and date (str). The user provided both the city and the date, so I can use those values directly. There's no mention of any other parameters needed. \n\nI should make sure the date is in the correct format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user's input is April 25th 2023, which translates to '2023-04-25'. That's correct. \n\nSo the function call should be Weather_1_GetWeather with city='Foster City' and date='2023-04-25'. There's only one function needed here. No other functions are available, so this should be the correct call."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city and date. The city here is Rutherford, NJ. The date is April 22nd, 2023, which I need to format as YYYY-MM-DD. So that would be 2023-04-22. The function's default date is 2019-03-01, but the user specified a different date. I should make sure to include both parameters. Let me structure the function call with city=Rutherford, NJ and date=2023-04-22."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function which takes directed_by, genre, and cast. The user specified the director as James Gray, so I should set directed_by to \"James Gray\". The other parameters like genre and cast aren't mentioned, so I'll use the default 'dontcare' for them. That should retrieve movies directed by James Gray regardless of genre or cast. Let me make sure the function call includes those parameters correctly."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the play_spotify_song function. The parameters needed are query, shuffle, and volume. The query should be in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName'. So I need to construct the query string. The song is \"Dil Nu\" and the artist is Maninder Buttar. So the query would be 'track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar'. The other parameters, shuffle and volume, have defaults, so I don't need to specify them unless the user wants something different. Since the user didn't mention shuffle or volume, I'll use the defaults. Therefore, the function call should be play_spotify_song with the query parameter set to that string. Let me make sure I didn't miss any parameters. No, that's all. So the correct function call is play_spotify_song with the query as specified."}

I should call the book_flight function with these values."}
