The function needs initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds.

Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, default US). Since the user specified the United States, I should include that. \n\nWait, the user wants the cheapest price. Does the store_price function return the current price, which might already be the sale price if it's on sale? Or do I need to check if it's on sale first? The on_sale function tells if a game is on sale, but even if it's on sale, the actual price is still retrieved via store_price. So maybe I just need to call store_price directly. \n\nThe parameters are all provided: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is 'PlayStation', region is 'United States'. So the correct function call would be to store_price with those parameters. I don't need to check if it's on sale separately because the store_price would return the current price regardless of sale status. Therefore, the answer is to call video_games.store_price with the given title, platform, and region."}

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, starting from rest means the initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function probably uses the kinematic equation for final speed when starting from rest, maybe v = 2d/t or something similar. \n\nWait, another function is 'calculate_acceleration', but the user isn't asking for acceleration directly. They need the final speed. So the 'calculate_speed_from_rest' function is the right choice here. \n\nLet me check the parameters again. The function requires distance and time as integers. The given values are 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. The initial_speed is optional, but since it's starting from rest, we can set it to 0. But wait, the function's initial_speed is an integer, so 0 is acceptable. \n\nWait, but in the parameters for 'calculate_speed_from_rest', initial_speed is optional. If the function uses the equation v = u + at, and u is 0, then v = at. But to find a, we might need another equation. Alternatively, if the function uses v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2ad, with u=0, then v = sqrt(2ad). But since a isn't given, maybe the function calculates it using the distance and time first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function uses the average speed approach. Since starting from rest, average speed is (initial + final)/2 = d/t. So final speed would be 2d/t. Let me calculate that. 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. But I need to confirm if that's the method the function uses. \n\nAssuming the function is designed for this scenario, I should call it with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But wait, initial_speed is optional, so maybe it's already assumed to be 0. Let me check the function's description again. The description says \"starts from rest\", so maybe initial_speed isn't needed as it's implied to be 0. \n\nSo the parameters required are distance and time. The user provided both. So the correct function call is to use 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is not needed here because the function is specifically for starting from rest. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be made with those parameters."}

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when two different quantities of the same gas at different temperatures are mixed. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to approach this. Since it's the same gas, the molar mass isn't a factor here. The key is to use the principle of conservation of energy, assuming no heat loss. The heat from the warmer gas will transfer to the cooler one until they reach equilibrium.\n\nThe formula for the final temperature when mixing gases is (quantity1 * temp1 + quantity2 * temp2) / (quantity1 + quantity2). That makes sense because it's a weighted average based on the moles of each gas.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided all these values: 2, 300, 3, and 400. So I can directly plug those into the function.\n\nI don't need to use calculate_mass here because the problem doesn't mention molar mass or ask for mass.

So I should call sort_list with elements ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order 'asc'. \n\nWait, the order parameter is optional, so if not provided, does it default to ascending? The function's param for order is required=false, so maybe the default is asc. But the user explicitly said ascending, so including order='asc' is safe. That should work.

The default for sides_per_die is probably 6 since that's standard for dice. Wait, but the function's parameters say that n_rolls has a default of 1, but in this case, we need two dice. So I need to set n_rolls to 2. The sides_per_die is required, so I should specify that as 6. Let me make sure there are no other parameters. No, that's all.

The get_population function has a category parameter that includes \"veterans\" as an example.
