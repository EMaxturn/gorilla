There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user is changing the food item to Caesar salad. The original function parameters for ChaFod include foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"without anchovies,\" so I need to remove anchovies from the ingredients. The foodItem is \"Caesar salad,\" newIngredients might be empty since they didn't add any, but removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". Special instructions might not be needed here, but maybe \"without anchovies\" is part of the removeIngredients.\n\nWait, the parameters for ChaFod: newIngredients is a string of new ingredients, removeIngredients is a string of ingredients to remove. So for the Caesar salad, foodItem is \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". NewIngredients is empty or not provided. The function has default values, so maybe just specify removeIngredients.\n\nThen for the drink: The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function requires drink_id and new_preferences as a dict. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should include \"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\". So the new_preferences dict would have those keys.\n\nSo I need to call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".

The parameters required are location, category, and language. The user mentioned \"technology news\" so the category should be 'Technology'. The language is English, which is the default 'en', so that's covered.\n\nFor Paris, France: The location format should be 'Paris, France'. The category is Technology, language is English. So I'll call get_news_report with those parameters.\n\nNext, Letterkenny, Ireland. The location needs to be in the format 'City, Country' since the user specified Ireland. So 'Letterkenny, Ireland'. Category again is Technology, language English. So another call to get_news_report with those values.\n\nWait, the function's location parameter says if the state isn't available, use 'City, Country'. So for Letterkenny, Ireland, that's correct. No need for a state abbreviation here. Both locations are valid. \n\nI need to make sure both function calls are correctly formatted. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info.

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I'll use the clone_repo function here. The parameters needed are repo_url and destination. The default destination is the current directory, so I can omit that unless specified, but the user didn't mention a specific destination, so I'll just provide the repo_url.\n\nNext step is to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory_name. Since the repo was cloned into the current directory (assuming the default destination), the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome'. So I'll call that function with directory_name set to 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, based on the analysis, create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. For the Dockerfile, the create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The analysis might determine the language, but since the user mentioned creating a Dockerfile based on the analysis, maybe the language is inferred. However, the function doesn't take parameters for language, so perhaps the directory name is the same as the repo's directory. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor Kubernetes YAMLs, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use the defaults. The directory_name is again 'nodejs-welcome', deployment_name is default, image_name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\nAfter creating the files, the user wants to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function is for pushing, but first, maybe they need to add changes. However, the provided functions don't have a 'git add' function. The push function automatically adds changes, so maybe that's the step. The directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message is 'Update changes', branch_name 'main', force_push false.\n\nWait, the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a step before committing. But the available functions don't have a separate 'git add' command. The push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe that's the function to use here. So call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name, commit message, branch, and force_push.\n\nSo the functions to call in order are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name nodejs-welcome\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name nodejs-welcome\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name nodejs-welcome (using defaults for other parameters)\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name nodejs-welcome, commit_message 'Update changes', branch_name 'main'\n\nWait, but the user's step 2.1 and 2.2 are to create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The analysis might determine the language, but the functions don't take that into account. However, the create_a_docker_file function's parameters only require the directory name. So perhaps the analysis is just to determine the language, but the Dockerfile creation is done regardless. The user might have intended that the Dockerfile is created based on the repo's content, but the function doesn't take any parameters except the directory. So I'll proceed as per the functions provided."}

They need help finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, the user asked to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The search_string would be 'CellResult', and since they want to include subdirectories, I should set include_subdirectories to True. The case_sensitive parameter is optional and defaults to False, so maybe leave that as is unless specified, but the user didn't mention case sensitivity, so default is fine.\n\nNext, they need the signatures of the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. For 'setCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and method name is 'setCellValue'. Similarly for 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is default False, which is okay unless the methods are private, but the user mentioned overriding them, so likely they are public. So call get_signature twice, once for each method.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. So the signatures of those methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' are needed to ensure correct overriding. So the function calls would be get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with method names 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'.\n\nSo the functions to call are:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature for class 'AbstractCellHandler', method 'setCellValue'.\n3. get_signature for class 'AbstractCellHandler', method 'getCellValue'.\n\nThat should address both parts of the user's request: finding relevant classes and getting the method signatures."}

The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't require units, just the numerical value. So I can call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. Maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but the function's example includes locations like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. The function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So for Singapore, it would be 'Singapore, Singapore' or 'Singapore, Country'. But the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\"\u2014that might be a mistake. However, the function can take 'City, Country' format.

Wait, the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\"\u2014maybe they meant Queenstown, Singapore? But that's not a real place. Alternatively, maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore. But the function can handle 'Queenstown, New Zealand' as a location. However, the user's input is \"Queenstown Singapore\", which might be a typo. But since the function requires a location string, I'll have to use the exact input. So the location parameter would be \"Queenstown Singapore\", but that's not a valid location. However, the function might accept it as a string. Alternatively, maybe the user intended Singapore, but wrote Queenstown. But the question is to use the given functions. So I'll proceed with the given input. So the location is \"Queenstown Singapore\", but that's probably incorrect. However, the function's parameters accept 'City, Country' format, so maybe the user meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore. But the function can take that as a string. So I'll call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown Singapore\" and unit as default 'fahrenheit'.\n\nWait, but the user might have made a mistake. However, the task is to use the functions as given. So I need to call both functions. The first function is get_area_of_square with size 5.0. The second is get_current_weather with location \"Queenstown Singapore\". Even if the location is incorrect, the function will handle it. So the two function calls are needed."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, Events_3_FindEvents seems relevant. It requires event_type, city, and date. The event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play\", and the city is Los Angeles. The date is 2023-03-10. \n\nWait, the user mentioned both music concerts and theater plays. So maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. Or maybe the event_type can handle both? But the parameters specify event_type as a string. So perhaps I should make two separate calls: one with event_type=\"concert\" and another with event_type=\"play\".\n\nBut the function's args say event_type is a string. So maybe the user wants both types. However, the function might not allow multiple types in one call. So I should call it twice. Let me check the parameters again. The function's event_type is a single string. So I need to make two separate function calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for either, so perhaps a single call with event_type as \"concert\" or \"play\". But the user specified both. So maybe two separate calls. \n\nSo first, call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type=\"concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\". Then another call with event_type=\"play\", same city and date. \n\nWait, the city parameter in the function can be \"Los Angeles\" or \"Los Angeles, CA\"? The function's description says the city can be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. So \"Los Angeles\" is acceptable. But maybe to be safe, use \"Los Angeles, CA\" as the city parameter. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nFor the first function call:\nevent_type=\"concert\"\ncity=\"Los Angeles, CA\"\ndate=\"2023-03-10\"\n\nSecond function call:\nevent_type=\"play\"\ncity=\"Los Angeles, CA\"\ndate=\"2023-03-10\"\n\nThat should cover both music concerts and theater plays. The user didn't specify any other parameters, so that's all needed."}

They want two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the Services_1_FindProvider is for searching hair stylists in a city, so I'll need to use that. The parameters required are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so the city parameter would be \"Sunnyvale, CA\". The is_unisex parameter is optional and defaults to 'dontcare', so I can leave it out or set it to 'dontcare' explicitly. Since the user didn't mention anything about unisex, I'll use the default.\n\nNext, booking the appointment. The Services_1_BookAppointment function requires stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user mentioned 'Elegant Styles' salon, so the stylist_name is \"Elegant Styles\". The time is 15:00, which is a string in 24-hour format. The date is 2023-05-10, which is already in the correct format. So those parameters are all provided.\n\nI need to make sure that the functions are called in the correct order. First, find the provider, then book the appointment. But the user didn't specify if 'Elegant Styles' is in Sunnyvale, so maybe the first function call is to find the provider in Sunnyvale, and then use that information to book. However, the user directly asked to book with 'Elegant Styles', so maybe the booking function is called directly. But the problem is that the booking function requires the stylist_name, which is the salon's name. Since the user provided the salon name, I can proceed to call the book appointment function with that name. However, the find provider function might be needed to confirm that the salon exists in the city. But the user might have already confirmed that 'Elegant Styles' is in Sunnyvale. Since the user explicitly mentioned booking with that salon, I can assume that the name is correct. Therefore, I should call both functions: first find the provider (to maybe get more details or confirm existence) and then book the appointment. But the user's question is to both search and book. So the answer should include both function calls. Let me check the parameters again. The find provider function's city is \"Sunnyvale, CA\", and the book appointment uses the salon name, time, and date. So the two function calls are needed."}
