The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nThe parameters required for calculate_displacement are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20, acceleration as 10, time as 5. The rounding is optional, but maybe the user wants two decimal places. Wait, the question doesn't specify rounding, but the default is 2. Maybe I should include it as default. \n\nSo the function call would be calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. The rounding parameter can be omitted since it's optional. Let me make sure there are no missing parameters. All required parameters are present. \n\nI don't see any issues here.

The user provided the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. So I should call store_price with those parameters.

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going. They mentioned it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas related to motion. Since it started from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance is given as 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The formula for constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. But since it started from rest, u is 0. So s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Solving for acceleration a, we get a = 2s/t\u00b2. Plugging in the numbers: 2*20/(4\u00b2) = 40/16 = 2.5 m/s\u00b2. But wait, the user is asking for the final speed, not acceleration. Oh, right, the question is about the final speed. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_speed_from_rest. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. The default initial_speed is 0. So if the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. So using calculate_speed_from_rest with these parameters should give the final speed. \n\nWait, but the user didn't mention initial speed. Since it started from rest, initial speed is 0. So the function should take distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. That should be the correct parameters. Let me check the function's parameters again. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). So yes, passing those values should work. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, and initial_speed 0."}

Wait, but the user didn't specify the height. Oh, right, maybe they assume the height is the same as the length or width? Wait, the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. So if it's a rectangular wall, the area is 30 * 12 = 360 square feet. But maybe the height is 12 feet? Wait, the problem says \"30 feet by 12 feet\", so maybe the height is 12 feet. But the user didn't specify. Hmm, maybe I should check if there's any other information. The user just said the wall is 30x12 feet. So I'll assume that the height is 12 feet. So area is 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.\n\nNow, the coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. So the total gallons needed would be area divided by coverage rate. Let me calculate that. 360 / 400 = 0.9 gallons. But wait, maybe the user expects a whole number. So 0.9 gallons would be 1 gallon and 100 square feet. But since the problem says \"calculate the total quantity\", maybe they need to round up to the next gallon.
