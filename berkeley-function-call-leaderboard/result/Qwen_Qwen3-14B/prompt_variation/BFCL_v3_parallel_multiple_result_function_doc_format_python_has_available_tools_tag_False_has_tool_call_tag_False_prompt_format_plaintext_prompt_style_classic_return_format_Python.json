There's get_sculpture_details which requires museum_location and sculpture_id. But the user didn't mention any IDs, so that might not be helpful here. Then there's get_artwork_price, which needs museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nWait, the user provided the materials (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 and 6x3) along with the museum locations (Philadelphia and New York). So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price. But the function parameters require the size as a list. The user's input has \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to convert those into lists of numbers. Maybe [4,4] and [6,3]? But the function might expect three dimensions, but the user gave two. Hmm, maybe it's okay, or maybe the function expects a list of two elements for 2D dimensions. \n\nSo for the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is [4,4]. For the second: museum_location is New York, material is bronze, size [6,3]. Then, after getting both prices, the average would be (price1 + price2)/2. But the functions don't have an average function. The user is asking for the average, but the functions can only retrieve individual prices. So I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each sculpture, then compute the average manually. But since the assistant can only call functions, not compute averages, maybe the answer is to call both functions and then the user would have to average them.

But the assistant can't perform calculations, so the answer would be to make both function calls. The user would then have the two prices and can compute the average themselves.
