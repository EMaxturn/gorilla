So, the first function call should be data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nNext, the user wants to fit the linear regression. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y arrays.

The user is asking for the average price of a 4x4 ft marble statue in the Museum of Philadelphia and a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in the New York Museum. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The available functions are get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nFor the first part, the marble statue in the Philadelphia Museum. The get_sculpture_details function requires a museum_location and a sculpture_id. But the user didn't provide the sculpture ID. However, maybe the sculpture_id is part of the parameters. Wait, the function requires both museum_location and sculpture_id as required parameters. Since the user mentioned the museum location, but not the sculpture ID, maybe I can't retrieve that info. But maybe the sculpture ID is stored in the database, so perhaps the user expects me to use that. But without the ID, I can't call the function. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\nThen for the second part, the bronze sculpture in New York. Again, the get_sculpture_details function needs the museum_location and sculpture_id. The user provided the location, but again, the ID is missing. So maybe I can't retrieve both sculptures' details without the IDs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_artwork_price function can be used. Let me check. The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user mentioned the material (marble and bronze), and the sizes (4x4 ft and 6x3 ft). But the problem is that the function requires the sculpture_material as a parameter, but the sculpture's material is marble and bronze. However, the function's parameters are: sculpture_material (required), and the other parameters. \n\nWait, the get_artwork_price function's parameters include sculpture_material, but the user hasn't provided the material. Wait, the user is asking for the average price, so maybe the function can be used to get the price based on material and size. But the user hasn't provided the sculpture's material. Wait, the user mentioned the material as marble and bronze. So maybe the function can be called with those materials. \n\nBut the problem is that the get_sculpture_details function requires both museum_location and sculpture_id. Since the user hasn't provided the sculpture IDs, maybe I can't call that function. However, perhaps the sculpture IDs are part of the database, and the user expects me to use that. But without the IDs, I can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_artwork_price function can be used to get the price based on material and size. Let me check the parameters again. The get_artwork_price function's parameters are: museum_location (required), sculpture_material (required), and sculpture_size (array). The user provided the sizes, so that's okay. The materials are marble and bronze. So maybe I can call get_artwork_price for both sculptures. \n\nBut the user is asking for the average price. So perhaps I need to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then average the prices. But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the sculpture IDs. \n\nWait, maybe the get_sculpture_details function can be used to get the details, which might include the material and size. But without the ID, how can I get that? \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The user hasn't provided the sculpture IDs, so I can't call get_sculpture_details. Therefore, maybe the functions available can't be used directly because the required parameters are missing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_artwork_price function can be used to get the price based on material and size. Let me try that. \n\nSo, for the marble statue in Philadelphia: call get_artwork_price with museum_location \"Museum of Philadelphia\", sculpture_material \"marble\", and sculpture_size [4,4]. \n\nFor the bronze sculpture in New York: call get_artwork_price with museum_location \"New York Museum\", sculpture_material \"bronze\", and sculpture_size [6,3]. \n\nThen, average the two prices. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the actual prices, so maybe the functions can't be used without the IDs. However, the problem is that the user's question requires the average price, which implies that the functions can be used. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, assuming that the IDs are available. Even though the user didn't provide them, perhaps the system expects that the function can be called with the necessary parameters. \n\nSo the final answer would be two function calls: one for each sculpture, using the provided locations and materials, and then averaging the results. \n\nBut since the user's question requires the average, maybe the functions can be used to get the individual prices and then compute the average. \n\nTherefore, the required function calls are:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n{\"function\":\"get_artwork_price\",\"parameters\":{\"museum_location\":\"Museum of Philadelphia\",\"sculpture_material\":\"marble\",\"sculpture_size\":[\"4\",\"4\"]}}\n</TOOLCALL>\n<TOOLCALL>\n{\"function\":\"get_artwork_price\",\"parameters\":{\"museum_location\":\"New York Museum\",\"sculpture_material\":\"bronze\",\"sculpture_size\":[\"6\",\"3\"]}}\n</TOOLCALL>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

The glucose conversion efficiency is 10%, and the energy per mole is 2800 kJ. So, I need to use the biological.calc_energy function. The parameters here are mols (5 moles) and substance (C6H12O6). The efficiency is 10%, which is a parameter they provided, so maybe I should include that as well. Wait, the function's parameters for biological.calc_energy have a 'joules_per_mol' parameter, but the default is for glucose. Since the user specified 2800 kJ/mol, which is 2800000 J/mol, I should use that. So the function call would be biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance=C6H12O6, and joules_per_mol=2800000.\n\nNext, calculate the biomass. The conversion efficiency is 10%, so the biomass would be energy divided by efficiency. So another function call: biological.calc_biomass with energy from the first step and efficiency 10%. The parameters here are energy and efficiency.\n\nThird, calculate work done by the machine. The work is energy multiplied by distance. The machine moves 2 meters. So use physical.calc_work with energy from the first step and distance 2. The parameters here are energy and distance.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly included. Let me check each function again. The first function requires energy, which is from the second step. The second function needs energy and efficiency. The third uses energy and distance.

He's investing $3000, 5% annual rate, 6 years, compounded annually. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Since it's compounded annually, n=1.

The user mentioned Manchester United, so I should use the player_stats function for Cristiano Ronaldo and the team_stats function for Manchester United. \n\nFor the first part, the player_stats function requires player_name, team_name, and optionally competition.

The function prediction.evolution requires species, years, and model. The species is \"African elephant\", years is 100, and model is \"Darwin\". So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nThen, for the poker game, they want to calculate the probability of getting a royal flush. The probability is 4 out of 52, but the user specified 3 decimal places. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4, and round_to is 3. So I'll call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly formatted. Let me verify each function's required parameters again. The modify_painting function requires all three parameters, and the others are optional. The poker probability uses the given values. So the final answer should include all three function calls in the specified format."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The house has an area of 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. So I need to use the predict_house_price function. The parameters required are area, rooms, year, and location. All those are provided, so I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the user specified San Francisco county, I should use that. So I'll call lawsuit_search with entity \"John Doe\", county \"San Francisco\", and state maybe? Wait, the state is optional. The default is California, but since the county is specified, maybe the state is irrelevant here. So just entity, county.\n\nThird, the probability of winning the lottery. The parameters are total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places. So I'll call calculate_probability with those values and round to 3 decimals.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check again. For the house price, area is 2000, rooms 4, year 1985, location San Francisco. For lawsuits, entity is John Doe, county San Francisco. For lottery, total 1000, favorable 5. All required parameters are present. So the three function calls should cover all parts of the user's request."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of Apple Inc. lawsuit in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: the get_collectables_in_season function. The game is Animal Crossing, season is Summer, and item_type should be 'fish'. So I need to call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game is Fortnite, platform is PlayStation, region is Asia. So use the game_score.highest function with those parameters.\n\nThird, the lawsuits details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function requires company_name, year, and case_type. The user didn't specify case_type, so maybe leave it out. So call that function with company_name 'Apple Inc.', year 2018.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. So plug those into the parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters. Yes, all are required except case_type for lawsuit, and the parameters for the other functions. So each function call should be made with the correct parameters."}
