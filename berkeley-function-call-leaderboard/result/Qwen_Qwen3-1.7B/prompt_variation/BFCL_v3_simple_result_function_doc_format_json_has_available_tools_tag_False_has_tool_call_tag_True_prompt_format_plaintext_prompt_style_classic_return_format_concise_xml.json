The gravity is default 9.81, so maybe we don't need to specify it. But the user mentioned the initial velocity is zero, so maybe including it explicitly is better. Wait, the parameters have initial_velocity as a required field? No, looking back, the required parameters are only 'height'. So initial_velocity is optional. But the user provided initial_velocity as zero, so we can include it. But since it's the default, maybe it's okay to omit. However, to be precise, maybe include it. But the function's parameters say initial_velocity is an integer with default 0. So if we don't provide it, it uses 0. But the user specified it as zero, so maybe it's better to include it. But the function's required parameters are only height. So the call would be calculate_final_velocity with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. But since gravity is default, maybe we can omit it. However, the function's parameters have gravity as a parameter with a default. So the user might not need to specify it.

So the call would be calculate_final_velocity with height=150 and initial_velocity=0. But the user said initial velocity is zero, so maybe include it. But the function's initial_velocity is optional. So the correct call is to pass height=150, initial_velocity=0. The gravity is default, so we don't need to include it.

The user provided all three: team_name is Manchester United, num_of_games is 6, and league is Premier League.

The user is asking for 'rating' and 'player count', so I should include those in the parameters. The default language is English, which is fine unless specified otherwise.
