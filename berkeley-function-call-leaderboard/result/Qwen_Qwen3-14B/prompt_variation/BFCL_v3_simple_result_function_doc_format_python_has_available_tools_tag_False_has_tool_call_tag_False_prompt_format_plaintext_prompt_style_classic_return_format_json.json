The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The user provided the height as 150 meters and mentioned the initial velocity is zero. The gravity isn't specified, so I should use the default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, the parameters would be height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. Since the initial velocity is zero, that's the default, but the user explicitly stated it, so I should include it. Gravity is the default, but maybe it's better to specify it anyway for clarity. Wait, the function's default for gravity is 9.81, so even if I don't include it, it's okay.

Let me make sure the function is called correctly. The parameters are height (int), initial_velocity (int), and gravity (float).

The user provided \"Los Angeles, California\" which includes the state. The function's description says the location should be in the format of a city name.
