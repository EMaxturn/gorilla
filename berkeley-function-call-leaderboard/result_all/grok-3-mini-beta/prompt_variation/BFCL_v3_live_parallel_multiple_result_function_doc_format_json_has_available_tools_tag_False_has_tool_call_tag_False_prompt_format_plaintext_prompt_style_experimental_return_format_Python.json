Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n2. Stop the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the one that matches is 'ControlAppliance.execute'. This function is for controlling home appliances.\n\nThe description says: \"The command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\"\n\nExamples given:\n\n- '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589' for activating cooling without specifying the room.\n\n- '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine in the utility room.\n\nFor the first part: \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" \u2013 that matches exactly one of the enum values.\n\nFor the second part: \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\" \u2013 This isn't directly in the enum, but the enum is just examples. The description allows for similar formats.\n\nThe parameters for 'ControlAppliance.execute' require a 'command' which is a string from the enum: ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0'].\n\nThe enum only has those three options. \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\" isn't in the enum. Does that mean I can't use it?\n\nThe function definition says: 'enum': ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0']\n\nSo, strictly speaking, the command must be one of those exact strings. But the user is asking for something similar but not exactly matching.\n\nIn the system prompt, it says: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\"\n\nHowever, I need to return only function calls in the specified format. If I can't, I should not include other text.\n\nThe instructions: \"Return only the function calls in your response. Use the following format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]. Do not include any other text.\"\n\nIf I try to call it with a non-enum value, it might not work, but as an AI, I should only use what's allowed.\n\nPerhaps I can only call it for the part that matches. The first command \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" is exactly in the enum.\n\nFor the second, it's not, so I might need to only call for the first one.\n\nThe user has two requests in one query. I need to handle what I can.\n\nThe function might accept it if it's in the correct format, even if not in the enum, but based on the definition, it's specified as enum, so I should stick to that.\n\nIn the parameters, it's 'enum': those values, so I can only use those.\n\nFor this query, I can only generate a function call for the first part that matches.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"In each turn, do your best to fully address the user's request. Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\"\n\nI might need to generate multiple calls if possible.\n\nOnly one matches.\n\nPerhaps I can generate a call for \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" and indicate for the other, but I can't indicate; I have to only return function calls.\n\nIf I can't, I should not generate it.\n\nThe exact instruction: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\" But then it says \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" There's a contradiction.\n\nLooking back: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\" But in the format section, it says to return only the function calls.\n\nPerhaps in this context, if I can't, I just don't return anything, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nThe full sentence: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this. Return only the function calls in your response.\"\n\nIt might mean to indicate in the response, but the response should only be function calls, so maybe if I can't, return nothing or a specific format.\n\nTo be safe, I'll only generate calls for what I can.\n\nFor the first part: ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589')\n\nFor the second, since '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' is not in the enum, I can't call it.\n\nIs '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' exactly in the enum? No, the enum has '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0', which is similar but not the same.\n\nSo, perhaps only one call.\n\nThe user said \"\uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\", so it's two commands in one sentence.\n\nI need to parse it as two separate commands.\n\nIn the function, each call is for one command.\n\nI can make two function calls, but only if they match the enum.\n\nSince the second doesn't, I'll only make one.\n\nPerhaps the enum is not exhaustive, but based on the definition, I should follow it.\n\nAnother idea: the enum might be examples, but in JSON, enum means it must be one of those values.\n\nI think I have to stick to that.\n\nSo, I'll only generate the function call for the first part.\n\nResponse format: [ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589')]\n\nThat might not fully address the request, but it's what I can do.\n\nPerhaps the system will handle it in the next turn, but for now, I'll do this.\n\nThe user query has \"\uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\", which means \"and then\", so two actions.\n\nSince I can't do the second, I'll just do the first.\n\nI think that's it."}

Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\"\n\nI need to output function calls one by one, and the system will handle the responses.\n\nFor this response, I should generate the necessary function calls in sequence.\n\nStart with cloning:\n\n- clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\nAfter cloning, the repo will be in the current directory or specified destination. By default, it's '.'.\n\nThen, analyze:\n\n- analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='.') or whatever the cloned directory is. The user didn't specify a destination, so it defaults to '.'.\n\nWhen cloning, if destination is not specified, it's '.', so the repo might be cloned into a subdirectory like 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe clone_repo function: \"If omitted, the repository is cloned into the current working directory.\" Typically, Git clones into a subdirectory with the repo name.\n\nTo be precise, I should assume it's cloned into a directory named after the repo, say 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nIn the function parameters, destination defaults to '.', which might mean it clones into the current directory as a subdir.\n\nFor safety, I'll use the default.\n\nThen, create Dockerfile:\n\n- create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // assuming the dir name\n\nThe user didn't specify, so I need to infer. In clone_repo, I can specify destination, but I didn't.\n\nTo make it clear, I should specify a destination when cloning.\n\nLet me check: I can set destination to, say, 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so likely it will create a dir called 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nIn the function for analyse_repo_contents, it takes 'directory_name' as the path relative to the root.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll assume after cloning with default, the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo, sequence:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='nodejs-welcome')  // I'll specify it for clarity.\n\nThe parameter is optional, but I can set it.\n\nThen:\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // with defaults\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='something', etc.)\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, it will automatically git add all changes, so after creating files, I can call this.\n\nThe user said: \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is covered, then \"commit / push\".\n\nSo, in one function call.\n\nMy response should be a list of function calls in the specified format.\n\nThe format is: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params), ...]\n\nI need to return only that, no other text.\n\nSo, I'll list them in order.\n\nOne potential issue: The create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file might need the analysis results, but since the tools don't take that as input, I just call them after analysis.\n\nIn this setup, the system might handle the state.\n\nAlright, let's list them:\n\nFirst: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='nodejs-welcome')\n\nSecond: analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nThird: create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nFourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // using defaults\n\nFifth: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update with Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML')  // I need to provide a commit message\n\nThe user didn't specify a commit message, so I can use the default, which is 'Update changes'.\n\nTo make it meaningful, I can specify one.\n\nIn the function, commit_message has a default, so I can omit it.\n\nFor branch_name, default is 'main'.\n\nSo, finally:\n\n[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='nodejs-welcome'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]\n\nThat seems complete."}

Generate an image: \"a digital painting of a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style.\"\n\nI need to map these to the available functions.\n\nFor the first part: This is about searching for real-time information.

It can execute a search query and has an option to filter results from 2022 onwards.\n\n- Required parameter: 'prompt' \u2013 I can use the user's query as the prompt.\n\n- Optional: 'include_after_year' \u2013 Set this to True since they want only information after 2022.\n\nThe user said \"since October 2021\" but also \"Include only information published after the year 2022\". So, I should prioritize the explicit filter: after 2022.\n\nThe prompt should be verbatim as they said: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'. But with the filter.\n\nFor the second part: This is about generating an image based on a description. The function \"generate_image\" seems suitable as it's for general image generation.\n\n- Required: 'prompt' \u2013 Use the user's description.\n\n- Other parameters: I can use defaults or specify if needed.\n\nThere's also \"generate_human_image\" which is specifically for human subjects. The description involves a \"masked woman\", so this might be more appropriate since it's tailored for human demographics.\n\n- \"generate_human_image\" is for images of humans, like girls, boys, etc. A woman fits this.\n\nSo, I should use \"generate_human_image\" for this.\n\nNow, structure my response: I need to return only the function calls in the specified format.\n\nFormat: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)...]\n\nI should make one or more function calls as needed.

Then, regardless of whether I find it or not, I need to send a 'Happy Birthday!' message to him.\n\nAvailable functions:\n\n- send_message: This can send a message to a human user.\n\n- pause_heartbeats: Not relevant.\n\n- message_chatgpt: For asking ChatGPT, but that's not for previous conversations.\n\n- core_memory_append/replace: For editing memory, not searching.\n\n- recall_memory_search: This searches the prior conversation history for a specified string.\n\n- archival_memory_search: This is for semantic search in archival memory.\n\n- http_request: For external HTTP requests, not internal conversations.\n\n- Others: Not directly relevant.\n\nSo, to find information from previous conversations, I should use recall_memory_search. I can search for something like \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nThe query for recall_memory_search needs to be a string, like \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nAfter searching, I need to send a message. The user says \"regardless\", so I should send the message even if I don't find the birthday.\n\nIn my response, I need to generate function calls. I should produce one or more function calls to fulfill the request.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, search for the birthday in previous conversations using recall_memory_search.\n\n2. Then, based on that, send a message. But I can't make decisions based on the result in this setup; I just generate function calls. The system will handle the next steps.\n\nThe instructions say: \"In each turn, do your best to fully address the user's request. Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\"\n\nI need to chain functions if necessary. For example, first search, then send message.\n\nHowever, recall_memory_search might return results, and then I could use that to decide, but in this format, I just output function calls.\n\nThe user wants to congratulate regardless, so I can plan to send the message after the search.\n\nTo keep it simple, I should first call the search function, and then in a subsequent turn, based on the result, call send_message. But the instructions say to continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete in each turn.\n\nThe format is to return only function calls, and the system will proceed.\n\nI need to output multiple function calls in one response if needed.\n\nThe user said: \"find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\"\n\nSo, two parts: 1. Find out (search). 2. Send message regardless.\n\nI can call recall_memory_search first, and then immediately call send_message, since it's regardless.\n\nIf I call send_message right after, it won't know the result of the search.\n\nIn this system, functions might be executed sequentially, and I can assume that.\n\nTo be precise, I should just output the necessary calls.\n\nThe best is to:\n\n1. Call recall_memory_search for \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\n2. Then, call send_message with \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir.\n\nFor send_message, I need a recipient. The description says: \"The identifier of the recipient. This could be a username, phone number, or an email address.\"\n\nThe user didn't specify, but from context, it's Shishir, so I'll assume something like \"Shishir\" as the username.\n\nIn the function, recipient has a default of 'default@example.com', but I should specify it.\n\nThe user query implies Shishir is the recipient.\n\nSo, for send_message, message: \"Happy Birthday!\", recipient: \"Shishir\", and urgent: False by default.\n\nFirst, I need to search.\n\nIf I call both in one response, like [recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"Shishir\")]\n\nThat might work, as the system can execute them in order.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nOne more thing: recall_memory_search has an optional page and request_heartbeat. I'll use default page 0 and no heartbeat for now.\n\nsend_message requires only message, and I'll specify recipient.\n\nSo, let's formulate:\n\nFirst function: recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\")\n\nSecond function: send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"Shishir\")\n\nThe user said \"when Shishir's birthday is\", so perhaps query=\"Shishir's birthday\"\n\nAnd for the message, exactly \"Happy Birthday!\"\n\nI think that's it."}

The user didn't specify, so I can use the defaults.\n\nFor 'flipImageAction':\n\n- Required parameter: 'flip_direction' \u2013 The user said \"horizontally\", so that should be 'horizontal'.\n\nBoth functions seem to operate on an image, but neither specifies which image to use. In the function descriptions, they don't have a parameter for the image path or data. That's a problem. Looking back:\n\n- 'rotateImageAction' doesn't have a parameter for the image input.\n\n- 'flipImageAction' also doesn't have a parameter for the image.\n\nThis is an issue. In the provided functions, none of them explicitly require an image path or data as a required parameter, except for 'removeBackgroundAction' which has 'image_path'.\n\nFor 'rotateImageAction', it has 'degrees', 'image_format', and 'keep_original', but no image source.\n\nThis might be an oversight, but based on the given tools, I have to work with what's available. Perhaps the system assumes the image is already in context, or I need to proceed as is.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\" But in this case, the functions seem to be defined without input image parameters, which is odd.\n\nFor 'rotateImageAction', it might imply that the image is handled internally, but that doesn't make sense for a function call.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the functions will handle the image contextually. Since the task is to generate function calls based on the query, I'll proceed with calling them as specified.\n\nSo, for the user's request:\n\n1. Rotate by 20 degrees: Call 'rotateImageAction' with degrees=20.\n\n2. Flip horizontally: Call 'flipImageAction' with flip_direction='horizontal'.\n\nI need to return only the function calls in the specified format.\n\nThe format is: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)...]\n\nSince there are two actions, I'll include both in one response.\n\nFinally, once I generate these calls, the system will handle them, and if more is needed, it can continue.\n\nResponse structure: Just the function calls, nothing else."}
