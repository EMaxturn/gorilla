The parameters required are initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, default is 2, so maybe I can include that or leave it out. But since the user didn't specify rounding, maybe just use the default. So the function call should have initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No need for rounding unless specified. Let me check the function's parameters again. Yes, the function has initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. So the correct call would be those three values. The answer should be in the format of the function with those parameters."}

Its description says it fetches the selling price of a specified game in a particular platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I should call store_price with these parameters. \n\nWait, the region's default is United States, but since the user specified it, I should include it. The function doesn't mention anything about checking for sales, so if the game is on sale, store_price should return the current price. Since the user wants the cheapest price, maybe this function will return the current sale price if applicable. If not, maybe I need to check if it's on sale first? But the on_sale function only checks if it's on sale, not the price. So the correct approach is to directly use store_price with the given parameters. I don't need to check for sales separately because the store_price might already reflect the sale price. So the answer is to call store_price with the provided details."}

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are kinematic equations. The user mentioned starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. They gave distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_speed_from_rest. The parameters it needs are distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). That fits the problem. The function probably uses the equation s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2 to find acceleration first, then uses v = u + at to get final speed. Since initial speed u is 0, it simplifies.\n\nSo I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. Initial speed is 0 by default, so maybe I don't need to include it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The function's args are distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (int, default=0). So yes, since initial speed is 0, we can omit it.

Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nThe function calculate_final_temperature seems relevant here. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function.

The parameters are elements (the list) and order (default 'asc'). Since the user specified ascending, I don't need to set the order parameter explicitly. \n\nSo the elements parameter should be the list provided. The order is already defaulting to 'asc', which matches the user's request. Therefore, I should call sort_list with the elements as ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order as 'asc', but since order is default, maybe I can omit it. However, the function's parameters include order with a default, so including it or not is okay. But to be precise, maybe include it to make sure.\n\nWait, the user said \"ascending order\", so including order='asc' makes it explicit. The function's default is 'asc', so even if omitted, it's okay. But better to include it for clarity. \n\nSo the function call should be sort_list with elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order='asc'. Let me check the parameters again.

Oh, wait, no, maybe n_rolls is the number of times you roll the dice, but in this case, each die is rolled once. Wait, maybe the function is designed where n_rolls is the number of dice. Let me check the function description again. The description says \"Number of dice to be rolled.\" So yes, n_rolls is the number of dice. So for two dice, n_rolls is 2. The desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die is probably 6 since standard dice have 6 sides. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. That should calculate the probability correctly.

The user wants to find the top-rated modern sculpture exhibition in New York for the upcoming month.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions are card_game_probability.calculate, find_exhibition, and get_sculpture_info. \n\nThe find_exhibition function seems relevant here because it's about locating exhibitions based on criteria like location, art form, time, and user ratings. The user mentioned \"top rated,\" which relates to user ratings, and specified the location as New York and the art form as modern sculpture. The month is upcoming, so maybe the default value for the month parameter in the function can handle that.\n\nSo, I should call find_exhibition with location set to \"New York\", art_form as \"modern sculpture\", month as the default (which might be upcoming), and user_ratings set to \"high\" since they want top-rated. The parameters need to be checked. The function's args are location (str), art_form (str), month (str, default upcoming), and user_ratings (str, default 'high'). The user wants top-rated, so maybe user_ratings should be 'high' or higher. Since the default for user_ratings is already 'high', maybe we don't need to specify it, but to be safe, include it. The month is upcoming, so using the default, but the function's default might be set to return upcoming events. \n\nWait, the function's description says the month has a default value that returns upcoming events. So if we leave month as default, it should work. But the user says \"upcoming month,\" which might mean the next month. However, the function's default might handle that. Maybe it's better to set month to the upcoming month's name, like \"October\" if it's currently September. But since the user just says \"upcoming month,\" and the function's default is set to return upcoming events, perhaps the default is sufficient. \n\nSo the parameters would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"sculpture\" (since the function's example uses \"sculpture\"), but the user says \"modern sculpture.\" Hmm, maybe \"modern sculpture\" is acceptable as the art_form. Alternatively, maybe just \"sculpture\" is better. The function's example uses \"sculpture,\" but the user specified \"modern.\" Let's use \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form. \n\nPutting it all together: call find_exhibition with location=\"New York\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", month=default (upcoming), user_ratings=\"high\". Since the default for user_ratings is already \"high\", but the user wants top-rated, which might be higher than just \"high\". Wait, the function's user_ratings parameter is a threshold. If the default is 'high', maybe that's the minimum. But the user wants the top-rated, so perhaps setting user_ratings to 'high' will include those with high ratings. Alternatively, maybe there's a higher rating like 'very high', but the function's description doesn't mention that. The default is 'high', so we'll stick with that. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be find_exhibition with location=\"New York\", art_form=\"sculpture\", month=default, user_ratings=\"high\". Wait, the user said \"modern sculpture\". Should art_form be \"modern sculpture\"? The function's example uses \"sculpture\", but maybe it's okay to use \"modern sculpture\". Let me check the function's parameters again. The art_form is a string, so it can take any string. So using \"modern sculpture\" is acceptable. \n\nSo the final parameters are location: \"New York\", art_form: \"modern sculpture\", month: default (upcoming), user_ratings: \"high\". Since the month's default is set to return upcoming events, we don't need to specify it. The user_ratings is set to \"high\" to get top-rated. \n\nTherefore, the function call is find_exhibition with those parameters."}
