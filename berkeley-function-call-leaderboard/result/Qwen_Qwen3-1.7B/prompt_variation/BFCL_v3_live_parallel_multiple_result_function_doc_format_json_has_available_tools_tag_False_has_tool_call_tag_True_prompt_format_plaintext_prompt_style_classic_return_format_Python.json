There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the user is replacing the food item from whatever it was before with a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The original foodItem isn't specified, but the user is changing it to Caesar salad. So I'll set foodItem to \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients to \"anchovies\", and maybe add specialInstructions if needed. Since the user didn't mention any other changes, maybe just removeIngredients is enough.\n\nThen for the drink, the user wants drink_id 123, size large, temperature hot, sweetness_level regular, milk_type almond. The ChaDri.change_drink function has parameters drink_id, new_preferences which includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The default for size is medium, so I need to set it to large. Temperature is hot, sweetness regular, milk almond. The default for milk_type is regular, so I need to change that to almond. The user didn't mention any special instructions, so special_instructions can be left as default.\n\nSo I need to call ChaFod with the food item and remove ingredients, and ChaDri.change_drink with the drink ID and the updated preferences. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly set. For ChaFod, foodItem is Caesar salad, removeIngredients is anchovies. For ChaDri, drink_id is 123, new_preferences has size=large, temperature=hot, sweetness_level=regular, milk_type=almond. That should cover both changes."}

The function needs a 'location' parameter, which should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Guangzhou, it's 'Guangzhou, CN' and for Beijing, 'Beijing, CN'. The unit is set to metric by default, so I don't need to specify it unless the user wants imperial, but they asked for metric, so that's covered.\n\nI need to call the function twice, once for each city. The parameters for each call should be location and unit. Since the default is metric, maybe I can omit the unit, but including it explicitly might be better to ensure it's set correctly. Wait, the parameters have a default for unit, so even if not provided, it's metric. But the user specified metric, so maybe it's safe to include it. However, the function's parameters have 'unit' as a required field? Wait, no, looking back: the parameters for get_current_weather have 'location' as required, and 'unit' is a property with default 'metric'. So the unit is not required. So I can call the function with just location for each city. But the user wants metric, but since the default is metric, maybe it's okay. But to be safe, maybe include it. However, the function's parameters say 'unit' is not required, so it's optional. So the correct calls would be:\n\nget_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, CN') and get_current_weather(location='Beijing, CN')\n\nThat's it. So two function calls."}

The user has provided a series of steps to perform on a repository. Let me break down each step and see which functions I can use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and optionally the destination. Since the default destination is the current directory, I can just pass the repo_url. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The analyse_repo_contents function will analyze the repo and determine the programming language. Once I have that, I can use create_a_docker_file with the directory_name as the repo's directory. But wait, the directory name is probably the same as the repo's path. However, the user hasn't specified the directory name, so maybe the default is the cloned repo's directory. But the function requires directory_name, which I need to provide. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's path. But the function's parameters require directory_name, so I need to specify it. However, the user hasn't given a specific directory name, so perhaps the default is the current directory. But the function's parameters have a required field, so I need to provide it. Maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's path. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe I should use the default. Wait, the function's parameters have directory_name as a required parameter. So I need to pass it. But the user hasn't provided a specific name, so perhaps the default is the current directory. But the function's description says the directory name should be a valid path relative to the root. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's path. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the Dockerfile to be created in the same directory as the cloned repo. So I'll proceed with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo's name is nodejs-welcome). But the exact name might vary. However, the user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis.\" So after analysing, the Dockerfile is created. So the steps are: analyse_repo_contents first, then create_a_docker_file with the directory name.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name. Again, assuming the directory is the same as the cloned repo, maybe 'nodejs-welcome'. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name and optionally commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't specified commit message, branch, or force push, so use defaults. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The function push_git_changes_to_github does that by default. So the function call would be with the directory_name, and the defaults for commit message, branch, and force push.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nBut wait, the user's steps mention \"the repo\" in step 1, so the directory_name for the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. However, the function parameters require directory_name, which is a path relative to the root. If the repo is cloned into the current directory, then the directory_name could be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo's name is that). But the exact name might depend on the user's setup. However, the user hasn't provided specific details, so I'll proceed with the default.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]</TOOLCALL>"}

The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so I need to check if 'CellResult' is part of the repository. The function 'get_relevant_classes' is available, which searches the repository for classes matching a search string. The user wants to include subdirectories, so the parameter 'include_subdirectories' should be set to True.\n\nNext, the user needs the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters required are 'class_name' and 'method_name'. Since the user is working in Java, the 'language' parameter should be 'Java'.

Its description says it finds cultural events like concerts and plays in a specified city. The parameters required are event_type and city.

The function's parameters require the date as a string in that format. \n\nI should check if the function can handle multiple event types. The parameters for Events_3_FindEvents include event_type as a string with enum values, so passing both 'Music' and 'Theater' might be possible.

However, the user wants both. So maybe the function can handle that. \n\nIn any case, the main point is to call Events_3_FindEvents with the correct parameters. The city is Los Angeles, the date is 2023-03-10, and the event_type is either 'Music' or 'Theater'.
