They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user mentioned \"Caesar salad without anchovies,\" so foodItem is \"Caesar salad,\" and removeIngredients should be \"anchovies.\" No new ingredients or special instructions are mentioned, so those can be left as default.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new preferences are for a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. I need to structure this into a dictionary. The keys might be something like \"size,\" \"type,\" \"sweetness,\" and \"milk.\" Assuming the function expects these keys, the new_preferences would be {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nWait, but the function's new_preferences is a dict, so the exact keys depend on how the function is implemented. Since the user didn't specify the exact structure, but the function's description says it's for updated preferences, I'll have to format it as best as possible based on common parameters. The drink_id is clear, so that's straightforward.\n\nSo, two function calls are needed: one for the food and one for the drink. Both functions are available, and all required parameters are provided. No missing parameters here. Let me double-check: foodItem is provided, removeIngredients is anchovies, drink_id is 123, and new_preferences includes all the specified details. Looks good."}

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the clone_repo function. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function requires repo_url, and the destination is optional. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default, which is the current directory. So the first function call should be clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, step 2 is to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be the name of the repo, which is likely 'nodejs-welcome'. But I need to confirm if the destination after cloning is the current directory. The clone_repo's default is '.', so the directory name would be the repo name without the .git part. So the directory_name for analysis is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce analyzed, I need to create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. So after analysis, call that function with 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., have defaults. The user didn't specify them, so I can use defaults. So the function call would be with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter creating those files, step 3 is to add all changed files to git. But the functions don't have a 'git add' function. However, the push_git_changes_to_github function has a note that it automatically git adds all changes. So when pushing, that function will handle adding the changes. \n\nFinally, step 4 is to commit and push. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory is 'nodejs-welcome', commit message defaults to 'Update changes', branch is 'main' by default. So call that function with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned step 3 is to add all changed files. Since there's no explicit function for git add, but the push function does it automatically, I can proceed to call push_git_changes_to_github after creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. \n\nSo the order of function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with the given URL.\n2. analyse_repo_contents on the cloned directory.\n3. create_a_docker_file using the directory.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the directory.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github to commit and push.\n\nBut the analysis might influence the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. For example, if the repo is Node.js, the Dockerfile would use Node.js image. But the functions don't take parameters for that; they just create based on the analysis. So the analyse_repo_contents is needed first to inform the creation of Dockerfile and YAMLs. However, the functions for creating Dockerfile and YAMLs don't take parameters based on the analysis result. Wait, the create_a_docker_file function's description says it generates a Dockerfile based on the analysis. But the function's parameters only take directory_name. So maybe the analysis is done first, and then the Dockerfile is created, assuming that the create_a_docker_file uses the analysis result internally. Similarly for the Kubernetes YAMLs. So the steps are correct.\n\nSo the function calls in order are:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nI need to make sure that the directory names are correct. The cloned repo's directory name is 'nodejs-welcome' as per the URL. The functions don't return the directory name, so I have to assume that's the case. If the clone is done into the current directory, the directory name is the repo name without .git. So that's correct."}

Color mode and quality can stay default unless stated, which they aren't. Wait, the example uses generate_human_image, but the description is a human subject. However, the user specified \"digital painting\" which might be better with generate_image. But generate_human_image is tailored for humans. Let me check: generate_human_image's prompt example is \"a smiling girl with blue eyes\", so similar to the user's request. So maybe use generate_human_image with the detailed prompt. The image_quality is set to 'high' by default, which matches their request for complex and elegant. Also, the image_format can be PNG as default. So I'll use generate_human_image with the given prompt. \n\nWait, the user's image request is a \"digital painting\", which might not be a photo-realistic human. But generate_human_image is for human demographics. The example includes \"smiling girl\", but the user's request is more artistic. Maybe generate_image is better here. Hmm. The generate_image function is for general images, while generate_human_image is specifically for human subjects. Since the user is asking for a human subject (masked woman), but with a specific artistic style, perhaps generate_human_image is still appropriate. Let me confirm the parameters. The generate_human_image's prompt can take the detailed description. So I'll proceed with generate_human_image, using the prompt provided by the user. The image_quality is set to 'high', which aligns with their request for complex and elegant. The image_format is PNG by default, which is fine. \n\nSo the two function calls needed are search_engine.query with the prompt and include_after_year=True, and generate_human_image with the detailed prompt. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The search_engine's prompt is the user's query string: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'.

So the first function call is search_engine.query(prompt='significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021', include_after_year=True). Then the image generation."}

The function requires a query, page number (default 0), and optional heartbeat request. Let's start with page 0.\n\nOnce I get the search results, if there's a match, I can extract the birthday date. Then use send_message to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir. The send_message function needs the message, recipient, and urgent flag. The recipient here would be Shishir, but the parameter expects an identifier like email. Wait, the user didn't specify Shishir's contact info. The original problem says \"send a message regardless\", but the function requires a recipient. If the previous conversations have his contact details, maybe the search will include that. But if not, I might not have the recipient parameter. Hmm, but the user might expect that the system already knows how to reach Shishir, maybe through core memory. Alternatively, maybe the recipient is inferred from the memory. But according to the function's args, recipient is a required parameter with a default. Wait, the send_message function's recipient has a default of 'default@example.com', but the user probably expects to send to Shishir's actual contact.

This might be an issue. However, the user's instruction is to send the message regardless, so maybe proceed with the default, but that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the system has Shishir's contact in core memory. Let's assume that after recalling, the recipient can be determined. \n\nSo first, call recall_memory_search to get the birthday date and possibly contact info. Then use send_message with the message \"Happy Birthday!\" and recipient as found. \n\nBut the functions don't have a way to store contacts unless it's in memory.

The parameters are the class name 'AbstractCellHandler', the method name, and include_private set to False unless they want private methods, which they didn't mention.

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method found for get_weather(String). They want to know the available methods and properties of the 'Weather' class and the signature of the 'get_weather' method if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to check what functions are available. The get_class_info function can retrieve info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. So, I should call that with class_name='Weather' to see what's available. The include_private parameter is optional and defaults to False, which is fine unless they want private methods, but the user didn't mention that. Module_name is optional too, so if the Weather class is in the current module, we don't need it.\n\nNext, the user specifically asked for the signature of get_weather in the same class. The get_signature function is designed for that. It requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. Again, assuming the method isn't private, we can leave include_private as default.\n\nWait, but what if the Weather class isn't in the current module? The user didn't specify the module, so maybe the functions will handle that by default. The get_class_info has a module_name parameter, but it's optional. If the class is in a different module, the user might need to provide that, but since they didn't mention it, I'll proceed without it. If the initial call to get_class_info doesn't find the class, maybe the user needs to specify the module, but that's beyond the current step.\n\nSo the plan is: first, use get_class_info to get all methods and properties of Weather. Then use get_signature for get_weather in Weather. If the class isn't found, maybe the user needs to check the module, but the functions will handle that by returning nothing, which the user can then address.\n\nI should make sure the parameters are correctly set. For get_class_info, class_name='Weather', include_private=False (default), module_name is omitted. For get_signature, class_name='Weather', method_name='get_weather', include_private=False.\n\nI think that's all. Let's structure the tool calls accordingly."}

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. The parameters required are a and b, both non-negative. Since 36 and 48 are both positive integers, I can use this function. The larger number is 48, but the function doesn't specify that a has to be larger, but the description mentions a is the first and larger. Wait, the function's args say a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So maybe I should pass a=48 and b=36? Or does it matter? Well, GCD is commutative, so the order shouldn't affect the result. But to follow the function's parameters as described, maybe a should be the larger one. Let me check the function's args again. The description says a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So I should set a=48 and b=36. But actually, mathematically, GCD(36,48) is the same as GCD(48,36). So maybe the function is designed to handle that. Either way, the function should return 12 as the GCD of 36 and 48.\n\nNow, the second part: the steepness of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. That's the derivative of the function at that point. The user mentioned \"how steep the curve is,\" which refers to the slope of the tangent line, so the derivative. The function estimate_derivative can be used here. The parameters needed are the function, x, dx (optional), and method (optional). The function is f(x) = x\u00b2. The point x is 5. The default dx is 0.0001 and method is 'central'. Since the user didn't specify any particular method or dx, I can use the defaults. So I need to call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. The dx and method can be omitted as they have defaults. \n\nWait, the function's first argument is 'function', which is a callable. So I need to pass a Python function or a lambda. Since the user's function is x squared, I can represent that as a lambda. So the parameters would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. \n\nPutting it all together, I need to call math_gcd with a=36 and b=48 (or a=48 and b=36?), then estimate_derivative with the given parameters. Wait, the math_gcd function's parameters are a and b. The description says a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So if the user says 36 and 48, then a should be 48 and b 36. But the function's code might not care, but to follow the parameters as described, maybe the user expects a=48 and b=36. However, the user input is 36 and 48. Let me check the function's args again. The function's args are a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer... So the first argument should be the larger one. So for 36 and 48, a is 48, b is 36. So the call would be math_gcd(a=48, b=36). But the user might have passed them in the order 36 and 48. Wait, the user says \"highest common factor for 36 and 48\". The order doesn't matter for GCD, so the function should handle it regardless. But according to the function's parameters, a is the larger one. So perhaps the correct call is math_gcd(a=48, b=36). But the user input is 36 and 48. Maybe the function is designed to take a and b in any order, but the description says a is the larger. Hmm. To be safe, I'll pass a=48 and b=36. \n\nSo the first function call is math_gcd(a=48, b=36). The second is estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5). \n\nI need to make sure that the lambda is correctly formatted. In Python, the function parameter expects a callable. So using a lambda here is appropriate. \n\nTherefore, the two function calls are needed."}

The user provided 36 and 48, both are positive integers. So I can use math_gcd(a=48, b=36) since the first argument is supposed to be the larger one. Wait, the function's args say a is the first and larger integer. So I should make sure a is the bigger number. 48 is larger than 36, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the derivative estimation. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2. The estimate_derivative function needs a callable function, the x point, dx, and method. The user didn't specify dx or method, so I'll use the defaults: dx=0.001 and method='central'. The function parameter should be a lambda that takes x and returns x squared. So the lambda would be lambda x: x**2. The x value is 5. So the parameters would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5, dx=0.001, method='central'. Since dx and method are optional, I can omit them if using defaults. But to be explicit, maybe include them. Wait, the function's default for dx is 0.001 and method is 'central', so if I don't specify, it will still use those. But in the tool call, should I include them? The user didn't specify, so maybe just pass the required parameters. Wait, the function's args for estimate_derivative are function, x, dx (default 0.001), and method (default 'central'). So the required parameters are function and x. So in the tool call, I need to provide function and x. The dx and method can be omitted if using defaults. So the tool call would be estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5). But in Python, lambda functions are allowed. However, when passing a lambda as a parameter in a tool call, how is that handled? Well, assuming the system can handle it, since the function is expecting a callable. So that should work.\n\nSo putting it all together, first call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, then call estimate_derivative with the lambda function and x=5. The user wants both actions done in sequence. Since the functions are separate, I need to make two tool calls. The first for the GCD, then the second for the derivative. The user's question is a single turn, so I need to output both function calls in the same response. The format requires listing all the function calls in the TOOLCALL section.
