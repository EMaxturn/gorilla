The league is Premier League, so league='Premier League'. The location isn't mentioned, but the function has an optional location parameter. Since the user didn't specify a location, maybe we can leave it out, or set it to a default. But the function's description says if not provided, it'll consider all venues. So maybe we don't need to include location.\n\nSo the function call should be sports_team.get_schedule(team_name='Manchester United', num_of_games=6, league='Premier League'). \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are there. The team_name, num_of_games, and league are all provided. Location is optional, so it's okay to omit it. \n\nYes, that should do it."}

The language is defaulting to English, which is fine. So I'll call the function with those parameters."}

The function's description says if the deck isn't provided, it'll use a standard 52-card deck. So, maybe I can call the function with the default deck. But wait, the function's parameters require rank and suit. The user specified both, so I need to pass them. The deck is optional, so I can omit it. So the call would be find_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts'). That should locate the card in the standard deck. I don't see any other functions needed here.
