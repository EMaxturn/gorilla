The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics functions provided.\n\nLooking at the functions available, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters given by the user are all integers: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. The function's parameters are all integers except for rounding, which is optional. \n\nWait, the 'calculate_displacement' function's parameters are all integers. The user provided all the required parameters: initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. There's no mention of rounding, so maybe we can omit that. So the function call should be calculate_displacement with those three values. \n\nI should check if there's any missing parameters. The required ones are present. The other function, 'calculate_final_speed', isn't needed here since the question is about displacement, not final speed.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. It fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, defaults to US). Since the user specified the US, maybe the region parameter isn't needed, but including it would be safe to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe function might return the current price, but the user mentioned \"cheapest,\" which implies they want the lowest possible price. However, the function's description says it fetches the selling price, not necessarily the cheapest. But maybe the function returns the current price, and if there's a sale, it would reflect that. Alternatively, maybe the store_price function gives the regular price, and the on_sale function checks if it's on sale. But the user is asking for the cheapest, so perhaps the store_price is the right tool here. \n\nWait, the store_price function's description says \"selling price,\" which could include sales. So if the game is on sale, that function would return the discounted price. Therefore, calling store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as US should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available at the moment. \n\nI don't see a function that specifically finds the cheapest price across different times or deals, so the best option is to use store_price. The parameters are all provided: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So the function call should be video_games.store_price with those parameters."}

The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which calculates speed when starting from rest, using distance, time, and maybe initial_speed.\n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters: it requires distance and time. The user provided both: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, which matches the scenario.
