The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers and then use those results to find more HCFs. Let me break down each part.\n\nFirst, they asked for the HCF of (45, 60). I know that the HCF, or greatest common divisor, is the largest number that divides both numbers without a remainder. For 45 and 60, I can use the math.hcf function. Let me check: 45 factors are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45. 60's factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. The common ones are 1, 3, 5, 15. So the HCF is 15.
