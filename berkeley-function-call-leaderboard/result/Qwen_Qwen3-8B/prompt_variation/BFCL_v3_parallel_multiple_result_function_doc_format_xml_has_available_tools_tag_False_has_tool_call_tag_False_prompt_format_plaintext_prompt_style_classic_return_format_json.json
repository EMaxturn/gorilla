There's animal_population.get_history for historical data and animal_population.get_projection for future projections. \n\nFor the historical part, the user mentioned Bangladesh and India. The function requires country, species, and years. The species here is tiger, and the years are 5. So I should call get_history twice, once for each country.\n\nThen, for the projections in Nepal and Malaysia, the function get_projection is needed. Again, species is tiger, and the years are 10. So another two calls for these countries.\n\nWait, the parameters are all there. Country is specified, species is tiger in both cases, and the years are 5 and 10 respectively. No missing parameters.

The parameters required are file_path and optionally delimiter. The user provided the file name as dataset.csv, so I'll use that. Assuming the delimiter is comma, which is default, maybe I don't need to specify it unless told otherwise. So call data_loading with file_path=\"dataset.csv\".\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to fit the linear regression. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y arrays, and return_residuals as a boolean. The user wants x to be data['sales'] and y data['future_sales']. So after loading the data, I'll call linear_regression_fit with those arrays and set return_residuals to true.\n\nWait, but the parameters for the functions need to be in the correct format. The data_loading returns the data structure, which I assume contains the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. So the parameters for linear_regression_fit would be x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True.\n\nSo the steps are: first load the data using data_loading, then use the resulting data to fit the model with linear_regression_fit.

The function calc_energy seems right here. The parameters needed are mols, substance, and optionally joules_per_mol. The user provided 5 moles of glucose (C6H12O6) and mentioned the energy is 2800 kJ/mol. So I'll use calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800. That should give the total energy.\n\nNext, calculating biomass using the energy and 10% efficiency. The calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step will be used here. Since efficiency is 10%, I'll set efficiency=0.10. But wait, the first step's result is needed as input for the second. So after getting the energy from calc_energy, I'll pass that value into calc_biomass.\n\nThird, calculating work done by the machine. The work function requires energy and distance. The energy here is the same as the first step's result, and the distance is 2 meters. So after getting the total energy, use calc_work with energy from step one and distance=2.\n\nNow, checking if all parameters are provided. For the first function, all required parameters are there.

So parameters would be principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the compound interest option. The function calc_Compound_Interest needs principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. The second option is $5000 again, 5 years, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually. So compound_freq is 1. So parameters: principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1.\n\nThird option is a different initial investment. The future_value function requires initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings (optional).

But the user says to use the given numbers: total_outcomes is 52 and favorable is 4? Wait, that doesn't make sense because total outcomes should be all possible 5-card hands. But the user might have simplified it. However, the question states that in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible royal flush outcomes. So maybe they're considering each card as an outcome? That's not standard, but since the user specifies those numbers, I should use them. So total_outcomes is 52, favorable is 4, and round_to 3.
