The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned the account number, so maybe the BankStatementOverView function could be useful. Let me look at the parameters for that function. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided all these details: bank name is U.S. Bank, account number is 1-523-1713-5704, account type is business checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview includes totals and counts, which the user provided. \n\nWait, the user also wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires a list of transactions, starting and ending dates, total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, first and last names, and possibly a middle name. The user provided all these details except maybe the transactions list. But the user mentioned there were other deposits and withdrawals, so maybe the transactions array should include those. However, the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"there were other deposits totaling $7,132.76 and withdrawals amounting to $5,927.40.\" So the transactions array should include those. But the function parameters require a list of transactions. Since the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details, maybe I need to generate that list based on the given numbers. But the function requires the transactions array. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the transaction summary to be generated using the provided data. However, the transaction_summary.generate function's parameters include total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and the customer's first and last names. The user provided those. \n\nSo, the steps would be: call BankStatementOverView with the provided details, and then call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions array containing the given deposits and withdrawals, along with the other parameters. \n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the transactions array. The user mentioned deposits and withdrawals, but the function requires a list of transactions. So perhaps the transactions array should include those numbers. But how? The user's message says \"there were other deposits totaling $7,132.76 and withdrawals amounting to $5,927.40.\" So maybe the transactions array should have those values. \n\nBut the function parameters for transaction_summary.generate require the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, maybe I need to create that array. However, the user's message doesn't include the transaction details. Wait, the user's message says \"there were other deposits totaling $7,132.76 and withdrawals amounting to $5,927.40.\" So the transactions array should include those numbers. \n\nBut how to structure that? For example, each transaction could be an object with amount, vendor, date. But the user hasn't provided the vendor or date. However, the user's message mentions \"there were other deposits\" and \"withdrawals,\" so maybe the transactions array is just the total deposits and withdrawals. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transactions array should be an array of objects with the amount, vendor, and date. But since the user hasn't provided those details, maybe the function can be called with the given totals. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"there were other deposits totaling $7,132.76 and withdrawals amounting to $5,927.40.\" So the transactions array should include those two values. But the function requires a list of transactions. So perhaps the transactions array is just the total deposits and withdrawals. \n\nBut the function parameters for transaction_summary.generate require the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, maybe the function can be called with the given totals. However, the function's parameters are arrays, so perhaps the transactions array is just the total amounts. \n\nBut the user's message doesn't specify the transaction details. So maybe the function can be called with the given totals. \n\nSo, the plan is: call BankStatementOverView with the provided details, and then call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions array containing the total deposits and withdrawals. \n\nBut the user's message doesn't include the transaction details. So perhaps the transactions array is just the total amounts. \n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, call BankStatementOverView with the parameters:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n\naccount_type: \"business checking\"\n\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n\ntransaction_overview: { \"total_deposits\": 7132.76, \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40, \"total_balance\": 6737.37, ... }\n\nWait, but the transaction_overview parameter in the function is a dict. The user provided the beginning and ending balances, deposits, withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_overview should include those. \n\nBut the function's parameters for transaction_summary.generate require the transactions array. So perhaps the transactions array is just the total amounts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transactions array is an array of objects. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, perhaps the function can be called with the given totals. \n\nIn any case, the user's request requires both the overview and the transaction summary. So the steps are to call BankStatementOverView and transaction_summary.generate with the appropriate parameters. \n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"BankStatementOverView\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"bank_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>U.S. Bank</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"account_number\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>1-523-1713-5704</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"account_type\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>business checking</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"full_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"transaction_overview\" type=\"dict\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>\n        <total_deposits>7132.76</total_deposits>\n        <total_withdrawals>5927.40</total_withdrawals>\n        <total_balance>6737.37</total_balance>\n        <total_transactions>1</total_transactions>\n      </value>\n    </param>\n  </params>\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"transaction_summary.generate\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"transactions\" type=\"array\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>\n        <transaction>\n          <amount>7132.76</amount>\n          <vendor>?</vendor>\n          <date>?</date>\n        </transaction>\n        <transaction>\n          <amount>5927.40</amount>\n          <vendor>?</vendor>\n          <date>?</date>\n        </transaction>\n      </value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"starting_date\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>2019-10-01</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"ending_date\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>2019-10-31</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"total_deposits\" type=\"float\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>7132.76</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"total_withdrawals\" type=\"float\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>5927.40</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"starting_balance\" type=\"float\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>5532.01</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"ending_balance\" type=\"float\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>6737.37</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"firstname\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>SILVER</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"lastname\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <value>BUSINESS</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"middlename\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n      <value></value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"company_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n      <value></value>\n    </param>\n  </params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview in the first function is a dict, and the transaction_summary's parameters require the transactions array. The user's message mentions deposits and withdrawals, but the transaction array should include those. However, the function parameters for transaction_summary.generate require the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, perhaps the transactions array is just the total amounts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transactions array should be an array of objects with the amount, vendor, and date. But since the user hasn't provided those, maybe the function can be called with the given totals. \n\nIn any case, the user's request requires both the overview and the transaction summary. So the two function calls are needed. The first is for the statement overview, and the second for the transaction summary. The parameters for the transaction summary include the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, and the customer's first and last names. The transactions array would need to be filled with the given amounts. \n\nTherefore, the final answer would have both function calls."}

Wait, but the user's question is about movies playing today, not the show times. So maybe get_movies is the right function here. Let me check the parameters again. The get_movies function's movie_date is a string, and the user wants today's movies. So I need to set movie_date to \"Nov-4-2024\" and city as \"Noida\". The other parameters are optional.

They want songs similar to those on 'The New Classic' and tracks from six years ago, specifically 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to find songs similar to 'The New Classic'. The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. The LookupMusic function seems relevant here because it can find songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The user mentioned the album, so I should use that. The album parameter is 'The New Classic', and the year is 2023. But wait, the user wants similar songs, not exactly matching. The LookupMusic function might not directly find similar tracks, but maybe it can find songs with the same album. However, the parameters for LookupMusic include artist, album, genre, and year. Since the user is looking for similar tracks, maybe the album is the same, so I can set the album to 'The New Classic' and the year to 2023. But the user also wants tracks from six years ago. Wait, six years ago would be 2023 minus 6, which is 2017. But the user says this year is 2023, so maybe they mean six years prior to 2023. So the year should be 2017. But the user wrote \"around six years ago\" and \"This year is 2023\". Hmm, maybe they mean six years before 2023, so 2017. But the function's year parameter requires a four-digit number. So I need to set the year to 2017. \n\nNext, the user wants tracks released around six years ago. So the year should be 2017. So I need to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'The New Classic', year 2017. But wait, the user also wants similar songs. The LookupMusic function might not find similar tracks directly, but maybe the album is the same. However, the user might be looking for songs that are similar in style or genre. But the parameters for LookupMusic don't include genre or style. The user's request is to find songs similar to those on the album. Since the function's parameters don't include a way to find similar tracks, maybe the album is the same, so I can use that. But the user might need to specify that. Alternatively, maybe the album is the same, so I can set the album parameter to 'The New Classic' and the year to 2017. \n\nWait, the user's first part is to find songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic'. The second part is to explore tracks released around six years ago, this year is 2023. So the year for the second part is 2023 minus six, which is 2017. So I need to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'The New Classic', year 2017. \n\nBut the user also wants to explore tracks released around six years ago. So maybe the year is 2017. So the two function calls would be:\n\nFirst, Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'The New Classic' and year 2017.\n\nSecond, Music_3_PlayMedia if they want to play those songs. But the user hasn't specified playing, just finding. So maybe only the lookup is needed. \n\nWait, the user's question is to find songs similar to those on the album and explore tracks around six years ago. So the two parts are separate. So the first part is to find songs similar to 'The New Classic', which would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'The New Classic' and year 2017. The second part is to explore tracks from six years ago, which would be Music_3_LookupMusic again with the same album and year 2017. But maybe the year is 2023 minus six, which is 2017. So both calls would be to the same function with the same parameters. \n\nSo the final answer would be two function calls: one for the first part and another for the second part. But the user might need to specify that. So the correct function calls would be:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"Music_3_LookupMusic\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"album\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n      <value>\"The New Classic\"</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"year\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n      <value>\"2017\"</value>\n    </param>\n  </params>\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"Music_3_LookupMusic\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"album\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n      <value>\"The New Classic\"</value>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"year\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n      <value>\"2017\"</value>\n    </param>\n  </params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n\nBut wait, the user's second part says \"around six years ago\" and \"This year is 2023\". So the year should be 2017. So both calls have the same parameters. That makes sense. So the two function calls are both to the same function with the same album and year. That should fulfill both parts of the user's request."}

Let me think about the functions available.\n\nFirst, the Music_3_PlayMedia function allows playing a track with parameters like track, artist, device, and album. The user mentioned the album is 'High Expectations', so I can use that. But they also want songs from 2019. The Music_3_PlayMedia function doesn't have a year parameter, so I need to check if there's another function that can filter by year.\n\nLooking at the other functions, the Music_3_LookupMusic function has parameters for artist, album, genre, and year. The user specified the album and the year, so maybe using that function would help. But the user might not have a specific artist, so using 'dontcare' for the artist and album. Wait, the user said 'High Expectations' album, so album is 'High Expectations'. For the year, they want songs from 2019, so year should be 2019. \n\nSo, I need to call Music_3_PlayMedia with track 'High Expectations' and album 'High Expectations', and also include the year 2019. But the function parameters don't allow specifying multiple album or year. Wait, the function parameters are separate. So maybe the user wants to play either the album or a song from 2019. But how to combine those two? The user might want to play the album 'High Expectations' and also any song from 2019. But the function can only play one track at a time. So perhaps the best approach is to first play the album track and then check if there's a song from 2019. But the user might not have that information. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from 2019 that's on the album. But without knowing the exact track, it's tricky. \n\nWait, the user's question is phrased as \"I would like to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations', or alternatively, any song that came out in 2019.\" So they might be looking for either the album or any song from 2019. So perhaps the function can be used to play the album track and also check for songs from 2019. But since the user might not have that information, maybe the correct approach is to use the Music_3_PlayMedia function with the album and year, and then check if there's a song. But since the user wants to hear either, maybe the function can be called once. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from 2019 that's on the album. But without knowing the exact track, it's not possible. Therefore, the best way is to call Music_3_PlayMedia with the album 'High Expectations' and the year 2019. That way, the user can play either the album or a song from 2019. So the function calls would be:\n\n<function name=\"Music_3_PlayMedia\"><param name=\"track\" value=\"High Expectations\"><param name=\"album\" value=\"High Expectations\"><param name=\"year\" value=\"2019\"></function>\n\nBut wait, the parameters for Music_3_PlayMedia include track, artist, device, and album. The user specified the album as 'High Expectations', so album is set. The year is 2019. The artist is not specified, so maybe leave it as 'dontcare'. So the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"Music_3_PlayMedia\"><param name=\"track\" value=\"High Expectations\"><param name=\"album\" value=\"High Expectations\"><param name=\"year\" value=\"2019\"></function>\n\nBut the user might also want to play any song from 2019. However, the function can only play one track. So perhaps the user is satisfied with playing the album track. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from 2019 that's on the album.

So, I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nFirst, looking at the available functions: Music_3_PlayMedia, Music_3_LookupMusic, and Weather_1_GetWeather. The user is asking to play a song, so Music_3_PlayMedia seems relevant. But they also mentioned preferences about the style and album. The Music_3_PlayMedia function allows filtering by artist, album, genre, and release year. The user specified Hillbilly style and the album Gotta Be Me. So, I should use Music_3_PlayMedia with those parameters.\n\nWait, the parameters for Music_3_PlayMedia include track, artist, device, and album. The user hasn't specified a track, but they mentioned the album. So maybe I need to call Music_3_PlayMedia with the album as \"Gotta Be Me\" and the genre as \"Hillbilly\". But the function requires track, which is a required parameter. Since the user hasn't provided a track, maybe I can leave it out or use a default? But the user said they had heard that album, so maybe the track is \"Gotta Be Me\" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle that. \n\nAlternatively, the Music_3_LookupMusic function could be used to find songs that match the user's preferences. But the user is asking to play a song, not to find songs. So perhaps Music_3_PlayMedia is the right choice. \n\nWait, the user's message says they want to hear a song, so maybe they don't have a specific track in mind. But the album is mentioned. So maybe the function needs to play a track from that album. But the parameters for Music_3_PlayMedia include track, which is required. Since the user hasn't specified a track, maybe I can leave track out or use a placeholder. However, the user might expect that the function can handle the album and style. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Music_3_PlayMedia function can be called with the album and genre. Let me check the parameters again. The track is required, so if the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the function can't be called. But the user said they had heard that album, so maybe the track is \"Gotta Be Me\". \n\nSo, the correct approach is to call Music_3_PlayMedia with the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the genre \"Hillbilly\". The track parameter might be left as a default or omitted. But since the user hasn't specified a track, maybe the function can handle that. \n\nTherefore, the function call would be Music_3_PlayMedia with album and genre set to \"Gotta Be Me\" and \"Hillbilly\". The track parameter might be omitted, but the user might need to provide it. However, since the user hasn't mentioned a specific track, perhaps the function can be called with the album and genre. \n\nSo, the final answer would be to call Music_3_PlayMedia with those parameters."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration with the name 'UrgentAlert77f7' and a 5% error rate threshold. They also need to send notifications to 'admin@example.com' and 'support@example.com'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function can handle creating a global alert configuration. The create_global_application_alert_config function seems right here. Let me look at its parameters. It requires name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and optionally enabled. The user mentioned the name, threshold (5%), and recipients. The alert_type isn't specified, but maybe it's a default or maybe the threshold is in percentage. Wait, the threshold is given as 5%, so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' or something similar. But the function's parameters don't specify the alert_type. Hmm, the user didn't mention the alert type, so maybe I should assume it's a default or leave it out? Or maybe the threshold is in percentage, so the alert_type is 'error_rate'?\n\nWait, the function's parameters include 'threshold' as a float. The user provided 5%, which is 0.05. So the threshold is 0.05. The recipients are two email addresses. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7'. The enabled parameter is optional, but the user didn't mention it, so maybe leave it as false.\n\nSo the first function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with name 'UrgentAlert77f7', threshold 0.05, recipients ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. The alert_type isn't specified, so maybe it's a default. But since the user didn't mention it, perhaps the function expects it, but maybe the threshold is in percentage, so the alert_type is 'error_rate' or similar. But the function's parameters don't have that. Wait, the function's parameters include 'alert_type' as a string, but the user didn't specify it. So maybe the function can handle it, but I need to include it. However, the user's question doesn't mention the alert type. Wait, the user says \"for an error rate threshold of 5%\". So maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' or 'error_rate_threshold'? But the function's parameters don't have that. The function's parameters include 'alert_type' as a string, but the user didn't specify it. So perhaps the function can be called with the given parameters, and the alert_type is inferred. But maybe the user expects the alert_type to be included. Wait, the user's question says \"global application alert configuration\", so maybe the alert_type is 'global' or something. But the function's parameters don't have that. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user didn't specify the alert type, so maybe the function can be called with the given parameters, and the alert_type is left out. But the function requires 'alert_type' as a required parameter. Oh, right! The function's parameters have 'alert_type' as required. So the user's question doesn't mention the alert type, so maybe that's a problem. Wait, but the user's question says \"global application alert configuration\", which might imply that the alert_type is 'global' or something. But the function's parameters don't have that. So perhaps the user expects the alert_type to be included, but since it's not specified, maybe the function can't be called without it. But the user's question doesn't mention it. Wait, maybe the threshold is in percentage, so the alert_type is 'error_rate' or 'error_rate_threshold'. But the function's parameters don't have that. So perhaps the user's question is missing the alert_type. But the user's question says \"for an error rate threshold of 5%\". So maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' and the threshold is 0.05. But the function's parameters require 'alert_type' as a string. So I need to include that. But the user didn't mention it. Wait, maybe the user is assuming that the alert_type is 'error_rate' and the threshold is 5% as a percentage. So the function call would include 'alert_type' as 'error_rate', threshold as 0.05, recipients as the two emails. That makes sense. So the first function call is create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. Then, maybe the enable_global_application_alert_config function is needed if the user wants to activate it, but the user didn't mention enabling. So the answer would be to call create_global_application_alert_config with the given parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an include_revoked flag. The user provided the user ID, so I can use that. But the question is about retrieving all tokens, not just revoked ones. The include_revoked parameter is optional, so maybe I can leave it as default or omit it. But the user didn't mention revoked tokens, so maybe just include the default.\n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function. This function has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user didn't specify page or size, so maybe I can use the default values. But the user wants all tokens, so perhaps this function is for retrieving a list, not all. However, the user might need to get all tokens, so maybe this function is the right one. But the parameters here are optional, so maybe I can call it without specifying any parameters, but the user might need to get all tokens. Wait, the get_api_tokens function's parameters are optional, so if I don't specify any, it might return all tokens. But the user's request is to get all, so maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAnother function is post_api_token_api.APITokenApi.post_api_token, which creates a new token. But the user already needs all tokens, so maybe that's not the right function here.\n\nSo the user needs to retrieve all API tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens function can be used with the user_id provided. The include_revoked parameter is optional, so maybe leave it out. The other function, get_api_tokens, is for retrieving a list, but since the user wants all, perhaps that's the way to go. However, the parameters for get_api_tokens are optional, so maybe just call it without parameters. But the user might need to get all tokens, so perhaps the get_shareable_api_tokens function is the correct one here.\n\nWait, the user's question is \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So the user has provided their user ID, and wants all tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens function requires user_id, which is provided. The other functions are for retrieving tokens, but maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is the one that can be used here. The include_revoked is optional, so maybe leave it out. So the correct function call would be to get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345. The other parameters can be omitted if not needed.\n\nTherefore, the function call should be <functions><function name=\"CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens\"><param name=\"user_id\" value=\"12345\"></function></functions>."}

The user is asking about education, so maybe the 'experience_or_education_type' should be 'education' and 'experience_or_education_name' could be something like 'education' or 'degrees'. But the user didn't specify a particular name, just the institution. \n\nWait, the function's parameters require that 'experience_or_education_type' is a string. So I need to set that to 'education' and maybe leave the name as a default. But the user is asking for the institution, not the experience. However, the function's description says it retrieves detailed information about Adriel's professional experiences and education. So maybe the 'experience_or_education_type' is education, and the name is not specified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'experience_or_education_name' is not necessary here. The user just wants the education details, so perhaps the function can be called with 'education' as the type. \n\nI should call the 'detail_experience_and_education' function with 'education' as the type. The parameters required are 'experience_or_education_type' and 'experience_or_education_name' (though maybe not needed here).

The user mentioned 7:00 AM, so the format should be 'HH:MM' or 'HH:MM:SS'. Since it's AM, maybe '07:00 AM' is better. The date is tomorrow, so the date parameter should be '2023-12-01'.\n\nWait, the function's parameters: alarm_time is a string, required. Purpose is optional.
