Let me check its parameters:\n\n- base_currency (str): This should be the original currency, which is Japanese Yen, so \"JPY\".\n\n- target_currency (str): This should be the currency to convert to, which is United States Dollar, so \"USD\".\n\n- amount (int): The amount to convert, which is 20000.\n\nThe question provides all the necessary parameters:\n\n- Base currency: Japanese Yen (JPY)\n\n- Target currency: United States Dollar (USD)\n\n- Amount: 20000\n\nSo, I can directly use the convert_currency function with these values.\n\nMy response should only include the function call in the specified format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nI need to format it as: [convert_currency(base_currency='JPY', target_currency='USD', amount=20000)]\n\nOnce I make this function call, I've fulfilled the user's request, so I don't need to add anything else.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nIn this case, one function call should suffice.\n\nFinally, ensure no other text is in the response."}
