But the user didn't specify if the IP is part of the URL or if it's a separate parameter. The IP is given as 192.120.45.67, so maybe the URL includes that IP. But the function's params are for the query parameters. So the URL would have the IP as part of the path, and the node and pod as query parameters.\n\nWait, the function's parameters are url (the full URL) and params (the query parameters).

But the user also mentioned the IP, which is part of the URL. So the IP is part of the URL's host, but the function's url parameter would include that. So the params would be node=12, pod=10. The IP is part of the URL's host, so maybe the URL is constructed with the IP as the host, and the path as the rest. So the function call would have the url as the full URL with the IP, and the params as the node and pod.\n\nBut the user's question is a bit ambiguous. The IP is given as 192.120.45.67, which is the host. So the URL would be https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo?node=12&pod=10. The params would be a dict with node and pod. So the function call would be requests.get with url set to that URL and params as the dictionary with node and pod.\n\nBut the user might have intended the IP to be part of the URL's path, but the function's url parameter is the full URL. So the IP is part of the URL's host, and the path is the rest. Therefore, the function call would include the IP in the URL's host, and the params for node and pod.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nrequests.get(url=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo?node=12&pod=10\", params={\"node\": \"12\", \"pod\": \"10\"}).\n\nBut I need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted.

The given function is get_service_id. Let me look at its parameters. It requires service_id, province_id, district_name, and rating. The service_id is for the service type, like 1 for cleaning, 2 for ironing. The province_id is optional, but the user mentioned Bangkok, which has a province ID. District_name is required here as Chatuchak. The rating is 4.5.\n\nWait, the function's parameters: service_id is required? The required field says service_id is required.

But the user specified Bangkok, so I need to provide the province ID. However, the function's parameters don't list the province ID as required. Wait, the parameters for get_service_id have province_id as required? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back: the params for get_service_id have service_id required, province_id required? No, the required fields are service_id (required), province_id (required?), district_name (required?), rating (required?).\n\nWait, the parameters for get_service_id have:\n\n- service_id: required=\"true\"\n- province_id: required=\"false\"\n- district_name: required=\"false\"\n- rating: required=\"false\"\n\nSo province_id is optional. But the user is asking for Bangkok, so I need to know the province ID for Bangkok. However, the function doesn't provide a way to get the province ID. Wait, but the user is providing the district name, which is Chatuchak, and the province is Bangkok. So maybe the province_id is 1 for Bangkok. But the function's parameters don't have a way to get that. Wait, the user is providing the district name, so maybe the province_id is not needed here. But the function requires service_id, which is 2 (ironing), district_name is Chatuchak, and rating 4.5. The province_id is optional, so maybe it's not needed. But the function's parameters don't specify that. Hmm.\n\nBut the user is asking for a housekeeper in Bangkok, so the province_id should be 1 (assuming that's the province ID for Bangkok). So I need to call get_service_id with service_id=2, district_name=Chatuchak, rating=4.5, and province_id=1. But the function's required parameters are service_id, which is provided.
