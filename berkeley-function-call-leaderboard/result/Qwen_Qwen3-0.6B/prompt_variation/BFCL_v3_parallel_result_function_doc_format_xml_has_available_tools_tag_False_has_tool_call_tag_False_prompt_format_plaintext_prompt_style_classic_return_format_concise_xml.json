The parameters are all required except pressure, which is optional. \n\nFor the first experiment: mass is 2 kg, initial temp 25\u00b0C, final 75\u00b0C. Since pressure is given as 1 atm, which is a required parameter in the function? Wait, looking back at the function's parameters, the pressure is required as an integer if it's a parameter. Wait, the function's parameters list shows that pressure is required as an integer. Wait, no, looking again: the function's parameters include a pressure parameter with type integer, but the user provided pressure as 1 atm. Wait, but the function's parameters for pressure are required? Wait, no, the function's required parameters are substance, mass, initial_temperature, final_temperature. The pressure is optional. So in the first case, the pressure is 1 atm, which is a valid parameter. \n\nSo for each experiment, I need to call the entropy_change.calculate function with the respective parameters. \n\nFirst experiment: substance A, mass 2 kg, initial temp 25\u00b0C, final temp 75\u00b0C, pressure 1 atm. \n\nSecond experiment: same substance, mass 2 kg, initial temp 10\u00b0C, final temp 50\u00b0C, pressure 1 atm. \n\nWait, but the user says \"the experiment is conducted under a pressure of 1 atmosphere\" for both. So both calls need to include pressure as 1 atm. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\nFirst call: substance, mass, initial temp, final temp, pressure.\n\nSecond call: same substance, same mass, initial temp, final temp, same pressure.\n\nI need to make sure that all parameters are correctly formatted. The temperature in Celsius is converted to Kelvin for the entropy calculation. But the function's parameters accept integer values. Wait, the function's parameters for initial_temperature and final_temperature are integers. But temperature in Celsius is 25 and 75, which are valid integers. So that's okay. \n\nSo the answer should be two function calls, each with the respective parameters."}

This function retrieves information about a cell type, with parameters for cell_type and detailed. The user wants two different cell types: a neuron and a muscle. But the function can only handle one cell type at a time. So I can't call the function twice. \n\nWait, maybe I can use the same function twice, but the parameters would need to be different each time. But the user's request is to compare two cells, so perhaps the function can be used once for each cell type. However, the function's parameters are for a single cell. So each call would need to specify the cell_type for each cell. \n\nBut the user's question requires two separate comparisons. Since the function can only retrieve info for one cell, I can't fulfill both parts. The answer would need to state that the function can only provide one cell's description at a time. Therefore, I can't make two function calls here. I should inform the user that the available functions can't handle the request for two different cell types."}

But since they asked for species, I should include it in both calls. \n\nWait, the parameters for the function: species is a boolean, required false. So in both calls, I can set species=True. So two function calls: one for 2015, another for 2020. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The location is a string, year as integer, species as boolean.
