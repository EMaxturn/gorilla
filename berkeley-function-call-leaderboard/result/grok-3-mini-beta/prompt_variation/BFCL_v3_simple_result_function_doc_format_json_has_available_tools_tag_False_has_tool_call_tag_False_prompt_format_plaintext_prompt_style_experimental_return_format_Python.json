The description doesn't specify, but typically it's codes like 'JPY' or 'USD'. I should use the standard codes to be safe.)\n\nIn the function description, it says \"The base currency in which the original amount is present.\" It doesn't specify the format, but in currency conversion, it's common to use ISO codes like 'JPY' for Japanese Yen and 'USD' for United States Dollar.\n\nI need to use these in my function call.\n\nSo, for this query:\n\n- base_currency: 'JPY'\n\n- target_currency: 'USD'\n\n- amount: 20000\n\nThe amount is specified as an integer, and 20000 is an integer, so that's fine.\n\nMy response should only include the function call in the specified format:\n\n[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [convert_currency(base_currency='JPY', target_currency='USD', amount=20000)]\n\nAfter this function call, if it's successful, the system will handle the response. I don't need to make more calls unless something is missing, but here everything is covered.\n\nFinally, ensure no other text is included in the response."}
