The user is asking for an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There are two functions: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', which is one of the allowed enums (plus, comfort, black). The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So all parameters are present and correct for uber.ride.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2. The parameters required are loc and type. The loc here should be in the format 'City, State', but the user provided a full street address. Also, uber.ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10. However, the description of uber.ride2 says it's for finding weather, which doesn't make sense for a ride request. So probably a mistake in the function description. But based on parameters, uber.ride is the correct one because it matches the address format and all required parameters. \n\nSo the correct function to call is uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type as 'plus', and time as 10."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for a specific period. They provided the account number, name, dates, balances, and totals for deposits and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems to fit for the overview. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name (U.S. Bank), account number, account type (checking), full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING), and the transaction details like dates and totals. \n\nThe transaction_overview parameter needs a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned $7,132.76 in deposits and $5,927.40 in withdrawals. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So I can structure that into the transaction_overview.\n\nAdditionally, the user wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just the totals. So maybe I can't use that function unless there's another way. However, the user might expect the summary to be generated from the totals provided. But the function requires a list of transactions. Hmm, maybe the user expects the summary to be part of the BankStatementOverView, but the functions are separate. \n\nWait, the user asked for both an overview and a summary. The BankStatementOverView provides the overview, and the transaction_summary.generate would generate the summary. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe the summary can't be generated. However, the user might have intended that the summary is part of the overview. Alternatively, perhaps the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals, but the parameters require individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, maybe we can't generate that part. But the user might expect that the summary is included in the overview. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these. So the overview can be generated. For the summary, the transaction_summary.generate function needs transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. So maybe the user expects that the summary is part of the overview, but the functions are separate. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, perhaps the summary can't be generated. But the user might have intended that the summary is generated from the totals. However, the function requires individual transactions. So maybe the answer is to call BankStatementOverView and note that the summary can't be generated without individual transactions. But the user might have provided the necessary info for the overview and expects the summary to be part of it. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals, but the parameters require transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps we can't call it. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters and note that the transaction summary can't be generated without individual transactions. But the user might have intended that the summary is part of the overview. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals, but the parameters require transactions. Since the user hasn't provided transactions, we can't. Therefore, the answer is to call BankStatementOverView and mention that the summary requires individual transactions. However, the user might have provided the necessary info for the overview. Let's proceed with calling BankStatementOverView with the given parameters."}

Since the question is general, asking for the version without specifying a project, the get_version function is the right choice. \n\nSo I should call get_version with no parameters.

The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors.\n\nThe user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which probably corresponds to the 'moderate' price range in the enum. Also, they want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires it in 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and the state is NY, the location should be 'New York, NY'. \n\nThe category isn't specified, so maybe I can leave it out or choose a general one. Wait, the function requires 'category' as a required parameter. The user didn't specify a cuisine type, so maybe I should pick a general category like 'American' or 'Bistro'? But the user didn't mention any specific category, so perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for a general search without a specific category. Wait, no, the 'category' is required. Hmm, the user didn't specify, so maybe I should use a default or general category. Looking at the enum list, 'American' might be a safe choice as a general category. Alternatively, maybe 'Brasserie' or 'Bistro' could work, but the user didn't specify. Since the user is just looking for any restaurants with the given criteria, perhaps selecting a common category is acceptable. Let's go with 'American' as the category.\n\nSo, putting it all together: category is 'American', location is 'New York, NY', price_range is 'moderate', has_seating_outdoors is True.

The user provided the check-in date as July 15th, stay length 5 days, but didn't specify the location or the hotel name. The location is missing. Also, the number of rooms isn't mentioned. The user might assume default values, but the function parameters have defaults. For example, number_of_rooms defaults to 'dontcare' in ReserveHotel. However, the user might need to provide the location. Since the user hasn't specified the city or state for the hotel location, I can't proceed without that. They mentioned \"go to the studio sessions,\" but the location of the studio isn't given. So I need to ask for the location. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use a function with the given info, but the required parameters are missing. The required parameters for ReserveHotel are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, and location. The user hasn't provided place_name or location. So I can't call the function yet. Therefore, I should inform the user that the location and hotel name are missing. But the user might not know the exact hotel, so maybe they need to search first using Hotels_4_SearchHotel. Let me check the parameters for SearchHotel. It requires location, and optional star_rating, smoking_allowed, number_of_rooms. The user hasn't provided location, so again, that's missing. So the main missing parameter is the location. The user needs to specify the city or town where they want to book the hotel. Without that, neither search nor reserve can be done.

Since the current year is 2023, six years ago would be 2017.\n\nFirst, I need to use the Music_3_LookupMusic function. The parameters required are artist, album, genre, and year. The user specified the album 'The New Classic', so I should set the album parameter to that. For the year, since they want tracks from around six years ago, that's 2017. The genre isn't mentioned, so I'll use the default 'dontcare'. The artist isn't specified either, so I'll leave that as 'dontcare' as well. \n\nWait, but the user wants songs similar to the album. Maybe the artist of 'The New Classic' is Sia? Because I remember that's her album. But the function doesn't have an option to get similar artists or genres automatically. So maybe the user expects the system to use the album name to find similar songs. But according to the function parameters, the album is a specific field. So I should just input the album name as given. \n\nSo the parameters would be album: 'The New Classic' and year: '2017'. The artist and genre can be set to 'dontcare' since they aren't specified. That should return songs from that album and around that year. But wait, the function's description says it finds songs based on the criteria provided. So using the album name might not directly find similar songs, but maybe songs from the same album. However, the user wants similar songs, not necessarily from the same album. Hmm, maybe the system uses the album's artist or genre to find similar ones. But since the function's parameters don't include a 'similar to' option, I have to work with what's available. \n\nSo the best approach is to set album to 'The New Classic' and year to '2017', and leave artist and genre as 'dontcare'.

But the user specified March 10th, so I should use that date. Let me confirm the parameters again.\n\nThe function's required parameters are event_type and city. The date is optional, defaulting to 'dontcare', but the user has a specific date. So I need to include the date as '2024-03-10' (assuming the current year is 2024 unless told otherwise).

Wait, the user said \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so maybe they want both types. However, the function's event_type is a single enum value. So perhaps we need to make two separate calls, one for 'Music' and another for 'Theater'. But the user might want both, so maybe the assistant should handle that.

However, the function can only handle one event_type per call. Therefore, the correct approach is to make two separate calls: one with event_type 'Music' and another with 'Theater', both in New York, NY, on 2024-03-10. But the user might not want to split it, but the function's parameters don't allow multiple types. Therefore, the assistant should make two function calls here.\n\nBut looking back, the user's message is a single request. However, the system allows making multiple function calls in one turn. So the correct response would be to invoke Events_3_FindEvents twice, once for each event type. Let me check the parameters again. The function's required parameters are event_type and city. The date is optional, defaulting to 'dontcare', but the user specified March 10th. Therefore, in each call, we need to set the date to '2024-03-10' (assuming the current year is 2024). \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. event_type: 'Music', city: 'New York, NY', date: '2024-03-10'\n2. event_type: 'Theater', city: 'New York, NY', date: '2024-03-10'\n\nThis way, both types of events are covered.

But looking at the parameters for LookupMusic, the genre has an enum that includes 'Country' but not 'Hillbilly'. The user said Hillbilly style, which might be considered a subgenre of Country. However, the enum for genre in LookupMusic includes 'Country' but not 'Hillbilly'. So maybe the assistant should use 'Country' as the genre.

However, the PlayMedia function has a 'track' parameter as required. Since the user hasn't provided the track name, maybe the assistant needs to first look up the track names from the album and then play one. But the user's message is a single request. Since the assistant can't perform multiple steps in one turn, perhaps the correct approach is to call LookupMusic to find the track, but the user's intent is to play it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can assume that the user wants to play a track from that album and use the PlayMedia function with the album name and possibly the artist if known. But the user hasn't provided the artist. The PlayMedia function's 'artist' parameter has a default of 'any', so maybe the assistant can call PlayMedia with track as a wildcard (but the 'track' parameter is required). Wait, the 'track' parameter is required for PlayMedia. The user hasn't specified a track title, so maybe the assistant can't call PlayMedia directly. Therefore, the correct approach is to first use LookupMusic to find the track names that match the criteria (album: Gotta Be Me, year: 2019, genre: Country) and then use that information to play the track. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So in this case, the assistant should first call LookupMusic to get the list of songs, then in the next turn, use that data to call PlayMedia. But since the user's current request is to hear a song, maybe the assistant should first look up the songs and then proceed. Therefore, the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters: album 'Gotta Be Me', genre 'Country' (since Hillbilly is a subgenre of Country), year '2019', and artist 'dontcare'. That should retrieve the relevant tracks, which can then be played using PlayMedia. So the correct function call here is Music_3_LookupMusic with those parameters."}

The other parameters like category and theater_name aren't specified, so I'll use the defaults. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly set. Yeah, that should work.

There's Trains_1_GetTrainTickets which reserves tickets. The parameters required are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. \n\nThe user specified the date as May 15, 2023, but the journey_start_time is one day before. Wait, that might be a misunderstanding. The start time is the time on the date_of_journey. But the user says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they mean the journey starts the day before the 15th? That would be May 14th. But the date_of_journey is May 15th. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, maybe the journey starts on the 15th at a time that's one day before a certain event? Not sure. But the function requires date_of_journey as 'YYYY-MM-DD' and journey_start_time as 'HH:MM'. \n\nAssuming the user meant the journey is on May 15th, but the start time is the day before (maybe midnight?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 14th. But the question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014so perhaps the start date is May 14th. But the function's date_of_journey is the date of the journey. So if the journey starts on May 14th, then date_of_journey should be 2023-05-14. But the user says \"on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe that's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14th. But the question states \"on May 15, 2023\", so perhaps the date_of_journey is May 15th, and the journey_start_time is the time on that day. However, \"starting at one day before\" is confusing. Maybe the user intended the journey to start the day before May 15th, which would be May 14th. In that case, the date_of_journey should be 2023-05-14. But the user's wording is unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and set the journey_start_time to a default time, perhaps 00:00 (midnight), but the user didn't specify the exact time. However, the function requires journey_start_time. Since the user mentioned \"starting at one day before\", maybe they meant the journey starts the day before May 15th, so May 14th. But the date_of_journey is supposed to be the date of the journey. So if the journey is on May 14th, then date_of_journey is 2023-05-14. \n\nBut the user's question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014this is conflicting. Maybe it's a mistake, and they meant the journey is on May 15th, and the start time is the day before (i.e., the previous day). But that would be May 14th. So perhaps the user intended the journey to start on May 14th. \n\nAssuming that, the date_of_journey would be 2023-05-14. The journey_start_time is not specified, but the function requires it. Since the user didn't provide a specific time, maybe we can set it to a default like 00:00. \n\nNumber of adults is 4. Trip protection is required (True). The class is Business. \n\nSo the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets would be:\n\n_from: Portland, OR\nto: Seattle, WA\ndate_of_journey: 2023-05-14\njourney_start_time: 00:00 (assuming)\nnumber_of_adults: 4\ntrip_protection: True\n_class: Business\n\nBut the user's original question says \"starting at one day before\" the journey on May 15th. So if the journey is on May 15th, then one day before would be May 14th. So the date_of_journey is May 15th, and the journey starts on May 14th? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user made a mistake in the date. Alternatively, perhaps the journey is on May 15th, and the start time is the day before (i.e., the previous day's time), but that's not possible. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the parameters required, I'll proceed with date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and set journey_start_time to a default time like 00:00. However, the user might have intended the journey to start on May 14th. But since the question states \"on May 15, 2023\", I'll use that date. \n\nSo the function call would be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with the parameters as above."}

The user provided the user_id as 12345, so that's covered. The default for include_revoked is False, which means it won't include revoked tokens unless specified.

The user didn't specify anything about expired tokens, so the default of False for include_expired should be fine. However, since they want \"all\" tokens, maybe we need to handle pagination. The default page_size is 20, but if they have more than 20 tokens, we might need to adjust page_size to a higher value or iterate through pages. But the user didn't mention anything about pagination, so maybe just using the default is okay for now. \n\nWait, the user's main goal is to get all their API tokens. The first function is for shareable API tokens, which might be a subset. The second function is for all API tokens.

Maybe the API is authenticated, and the user's credentials are used to fetch their own tokens. The user might have provided the user ID as additional info, but the function doesn't require it. So perhaps the correct approach is to use get_api_tokens without parameters, relying on the authentication context. \n\nBut the user is insistent and provided the user ID. Maybe they want to ensure that the tokens are for their account. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter, so including it isn't possible. Therefore, the best approach is to call get_api_tokens with the default parameters, which should retrieve the tokens for the authenticated user. \n\nAdditionally, to make sure all tokens are retrieved, including those beyond the first page, but since the user didn't specify, maybe just the first page is sufficient unless there's a way to handle pagination. But the user's urgency suggests getting the initial list quickly. \n\nSo the correct function to call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with default parameters. The user_id provided isn't needed for this function, but the user might have thought it was required. The other function, get_shareable_api_tokens, is for shareable tokens specifically, which the user didn't mention. Therefore, the best choice is to use get_api_tokens."}

The user mentioned \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which I assume is a typo for tomorrow, December 1, 2023. The date is provided as '2023-12-1', and the time is 7:00 AM. Combining these, the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' or using the 12-hour format with AM: '7:00 AM'. However, the function's example includes 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', so including the date and time in that format would be best. The purpose is for a meeting, so I can set the purpose parameter to 'meeting'.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"tomorro\" which is likely \"tomorrow\". The date given is 2023-12-1. I need to confirm if that's the correct date. Since the user specified the date explicitly, even if it's tomorrow, I should use that date. So the alarm_time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. The purpose is mentioned as a meeting, so I'll include that.\n\nThe set_countdown function isn't needed here because the user is asking for an alarm at a specific time, not a countdown duration. So the correct function to use is set_alarm with the specified time and purpose."}
