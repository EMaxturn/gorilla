The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers and then use the results to find more HCFs. Let me break down each part.\n\nFirst, they asked for the HCF of (45, 60). I remember that HCF, or greatest common divisor (GCD), is the largest number that divides both numbers without a remainder. For 45 and 60, I can use the math.hcf function. Let me check the parameters: both numbers need to be integers. 45 and 60 are integers, so that's straightforward. The result of HCF(45, 60) should be 15.\n\nNext, they want to use that result (which is 15) to find the HCF with another pair (90, 120). Wait, no, the question says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". Wait, maybe I need to clarify.
