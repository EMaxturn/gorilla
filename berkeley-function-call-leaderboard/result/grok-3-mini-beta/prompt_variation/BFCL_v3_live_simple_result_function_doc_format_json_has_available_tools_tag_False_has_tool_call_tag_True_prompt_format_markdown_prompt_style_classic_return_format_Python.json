As an AI, I don't have real-time capabilities here, but the system prompt instructs to default to today's date in India, so I can assume I need to provide it in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n\nIn the tool call, I need to provide the value. Since this is a simulation, I'll use a placeholder or assume I know the date. But in practice, for this exercise, I can just use the parameter as is.\n\nThe function's default is the current date, so if I don't specify it, it should use today's date.

I should use that as is, since the parameter is just a string for the city name.\n\nNow, for the tool call format: I must only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section, like this:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, I need to call 'Weather_1_GetWeather' with the parameters:\n\n- city: \"Marshall, MN\"\n\n- date: \"2023-03-05\"\n\nIs 'date' required? No, it's not in the 'required' list, but it's a property with a default. Since the user specified a date, I should provide it.\n\nMy response should only contain the <TOOLCALL> section and nothing else.\n\nThis seems to be a single function call to fulfill the request.\n\nAfter this call, if needed, the system might handle the response, but for now, I just need to make this call.\n\nFinally, ensure the format is exact."}
