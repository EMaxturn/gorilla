There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the Caesar salad, the ChaFod function seems appropriate. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"without anchovies,\" so I should put anchovies in removeIngredients. The foodItem is Caesar salad. No new ingredients mentioned, so that can be omitted. Special instructions might not be needed here unless there's more, but the user only mentioned removing anchovies.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new preferences include size (large), type (hot coffee), sweetness (regular), and milk (almond). I need to structure these into a dictionary for new_preferences. The parameters are required, so I must include them. \n\nWait, the drink function's new_preferences is a dict. How to format that? The user says \"large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\" So, maybe the dict should have keys like \"size\", \"type\", \"sweetness\", \"milk\". The function expects a dict, so I need to represent that properly in the parameters. \n\nPutting it all together: two function calls. One for ChaFod with foodItem as Caesar salad and removeIngredients as anchovies. Another for ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id 123 and new_preferences containing the specified options. I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, especially for the new_preferences dict. Also, check if all required parameters are present.

So I need to format each command correctly. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"\uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\" which is \"start and\" but maybe it's better to split into two separate commands. The function can be called once for each appliance. So first, \uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589.

So each command is a single string with commas. So I need to make two separate function calls? Or can I combine them into one command? The user's message has both commands in one sentence, but the function seems to take one command per call. \n\nThe function's description says the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start' for control commands. The user used '\uc2e4\ud589' which is start, and '\uc911\uc9c0' which is stop. So each appliance command should be a separate function call. \n\nSo first, call ControlAppliance.execute with command \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\". Then call another ControlAppliance.execute with command \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\". \n\nI need to check if the parameters are correct. The function's command parameter is a string in Korean with room, appliance, and operation separated by commas. Both commands fit that format. \n\nNo other parameters are needed for ControlAppliance.execute except the command.

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is the right choice here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. Since the destination isn't specified, it will clone to the current directory by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo's contents to determine the main language. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory name. Assuming the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be the repo's root, maybe \"nodejs-welcome\". But since the user didn't specify a subdirectory, I'll use the default, which might be the current directory. Wait, the function's parameter is required, so I need to provide a directory name. Let's assume the repo is cloned into a directory named \"nodejs-welcome\". So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nOnce the analysis is done, the next step is to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name. Again, using \"nodejs-welcome\" as the directory where the Dockerfile should be created. So call that function with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. Since the user didn't specify, I'll use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\". The other parameters can be omitted, and the function will use defaults.\n\nAfter making these changes, the user wants to add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can handle adding, committing, and pushing. The directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\". The commit message and branch name aren't provided, so I'll use default values. Maybe the commit message can be \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\". But since the user didn't specify, perhaps leave it as a default message. The branch name might be \"main\" or \"master\", but since it's not given, the function might default to the current branch. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\" and a commit message if needed.\n\nWait, the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which implies staging all changes. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes, so no need for a separate step. Then commit and push. So the push_git_changes_to_github function handles that. The parameters required are directory_name, and optionally commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. Since the user didn't specify, I'll set commit_message to something like \"Add Docker and Kubernetes files\" and branch_name as default (maybe main). But the user might expect a default commit message. Alternatively, the function might use a default message if none is provided. So the function call would include directory_name and commit_message.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo's directory.\n3. Create Dockerfile.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs.\n5. Push changes with a commit.\n\nEach of these steps corresponds to a function call. The parameters need to be correctly set based on the user's input and defaults where applicable."}

The recall_memory_search function can search prior conversation history. So I should use that with the query \"Shishir's birthday\". The parameters are query, page (optional), and request_heartbeat. Since the user might have mentioned it once, maybe page 0 is enough. Let me call recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\" and page 0. \n\nOnce I get the results, if there's a birthday date, then I can use send_message to Shishir with \"Happy Birthday!\". But if the search doesn't find anything, maybe I should still send the message as per the user's request to \"regardless\" send it. Wait, the user said \"regardless\", so maybe even if not found, send the message. But first, I need to check if the search returns the birthday. \n\nBut the user's instruction is to first find out from previous conversations and then send the message. So the steps are: 1. Search memory for Shishir's birthday. 2. Send the message. So first function call is recall_memory_search. Then, based on the result, send_message. But since I can't process the result here, maybe after recalling, the system will handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to send the message regardless of whether the birthday is found. The wording says \"find out... and then congratulate him by sending... regardless\". So maybe even if not found, send the message. But the function calls need to be made step by step. So first, perform the search. Then, send the message. But how to chain them? Since each turn is a function call, the assistant would first call recall_memory_search, then in the next turn, based on the result, send the message. But in this case, the user is asking for both steps. So the first step is to search, then send. So the first function call is recall_memory_search. Then, assuming the result is obtained, send_message. But the user might not have provided the recipient parameter for send_message. Wait, the send_message function has a recipient parameter, which is optional. But to send to Shishir, we need his identifier. If the previous conversations have that info, maybe the recall would include it. Alternatively, maybe the system knows Shishir's recipient info already. But since the parameters are required, if the recipient isn't provided, the function might not work. However, the user's question assumes that Shishir's birthday is in the conversation history, so perhaps the search will return the necessary info, including the date and maybe the recipient details. Alternatively, the user might expect that after finding the birthday, the message is sent to Shishir, but the recipient parameter isn't known here. Hmm. Maybe the send_message function's recipient is optional, so if not provided, it defaults to the current conversation's user? Not sure. But the user is asking to send to Shishir, so the recipient should be specified. However, if the previous conversations have Shishir's recipient info stored, maybe the core memory has it. Alternatively, maybe the system can infer it. Since the parameters are required, but the user hasn't provided it here, perhaps the assistant needs to proceed with the functions it can call. So first, perform the search. Then, in the next step, send the message. But without knowing the recipient, the send_message function can't be called properly. Wait, the recipient is optional in the send_message function. The parameters for send_message have recipient as optional. So maybe the message is sent to the current user, but the user wants to send it to Shishir. This is a problem. The assistant might not have Shishir's recipient info unless it's in the memory. So perhaps the recall_memory_search would return that info. For example, if in previous messages, Shishir's birthday was mentioned along with his phone number or email. Then, the search result would include that, and the assistant can extract the recipient and the date. But since the assistant can't process the result here, it's up to the system to handle. So the first step is to call recall_memory_search with the query. Then, in the next turn, based on the result, call send_message with the recipient and message. But since the user is asking for both steps, the assistant needs to make both function calls. However, the assistant can't know the result of the search in advance. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call recall_memory_search, and then, assuming the result is found, call send_message. But since the user wants both actions, the assistant should first perform the search, then send the message. However, in the current setup, each turn is a single function call. So the assistant would first output the recall_memory_search call, and then in the next turn, after the system processes it, output the send_message call. But the user is asking for both in one go. Wait, the instructions say: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" So the assistant can output multiple function calls in sequence. So first, call recall_memory_search, then send_message. But the send_message requires the recipient, which might be obtained from the search result. However, since the assistant can't know the result, it's possible that the send_message call would have to be made with the recipient parameter filled in based on the search. But since the assistant can't process the search result, it's a bit of a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the assistant will send the message regardless of whether the birthday is found, hence the \"regardless\" part. So perhaps the assistant should first send the message without checking. But the user's instruction is to first find out from previous conversations. So the correct approach is to first search, then send. Therefore, the first function call is recall_memory_search, then send_message. But the send_message requires the recipient. If the recipient isn't known, perhaps the assistant can't proceed. However, the user's question implies that Shishir is a known recipient. Maybe the recipient is \"Shishir\" as a username, so the assistant can use that. So the send_message call would have recipient set to \"Shishir\" and message \"Happy Birthday!\". But the assistant needs to make sure that the recipient is correctly specified. So the steps are: 1. Search for Shishir's birthday. 2. Send the message to Shishir. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\", page 0. Then, send_message with recipient \"Shishir\" and message \"Happy Birthday!\". But the user might not have provided the recipient details, but the assistant has to proceed with the available info. So the assistant will make both function calls in sequence."}

First, they want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. Second, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides.\n\nFor the first part, the function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified 'CellResult' as the search term and wants to include subdirectories. So, I'll set 'search_string' to 'CellResult', 'include_subdirectories' to true, and leave 'case_sensitive' as false unless specified, which it isn't. That should return all classes related to 'CellResult' across the repository.\n\nNext, for the method signatures, the 'get_signature' function is needed. They want the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. Each method requires a separate function call. The parameters are 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as each respective method. Since the user didn't mention private methods, 'include_private' can be omitted or set to false.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.

The function get_class_info is perfect for this. I'll use it with the class_name parameter set to \"Weather\". Since the user didn't mention including private members, I'll leave include_private as false by default.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. So I need to call that function with a=48 and b=36. Wait, the parameters specify that 'a' is the first and larger integer. Since 48 is larger than 36, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the second part, the user is asking about the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. Steepness here refers to the derivative of the function at that point. The function estimate_derivative can be used here. The parameters required are the function, x, and optionally dx and method. Since the function is f(x) = x\u00b2, I need to pass that as a callable. However, in the context of the tool, how is the function represented? The user might expect me to define it, but the tool's description says the function is provided as a callable object. Assuming that the user can input the function correctly, perhaps as a string or a lambda. But since the tool's parameters are a bit vague, maybe I need to represent it as a string. However, the parameter type is \"any\", so maybe it's expecting a Python function. But since I can't execute code, maybe the user is supposed to pass it as a string like \"lambda x: x**2\". Alternatively, the tool might have a way to interpret mathematical expressions. \n\nWait, the user is asking me to make the function call, so I need to structure it properly. The function parameter should be the mathematical function, so perhaps I can represent it as a string that can be evaluated. For example, \"lambda x: x**2\". The x value is 5. The dx and method are optional, but to get the most accurate estimate, maybe use the central difference method with a small dx, like 0.0001. However, if the default method is sufficient, maybe I can omit dx and method. But the user is asking for how steep the curve is, which is the exact derivative. The exact derivative of x\u00b2 at x=5 is 10, but since the function uses a numerical method, it will approximate it. However, the user might not know that, so the function call should be made with the necessary parameters. \n\nSo, putting it all together, first call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. Then call estimate_derivative with function=\"lambda x: x**2\", x=5, and maybe specify method=\"central\" for better accuracy. But since dx is optional, maybe it's okay to omit it. Alternatively, include a small dx like 1e-5. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps just the function and x are sufficient. \n\nWait, the parameters for estimate_derivative require the function as a callable. If the user is using a system where they can pass a lambda function, then that's fine. But in the context of the tool, how is this represented? The tool's parameter for function is type \"any\", so maybe it's expecting a string representation. So I'll have to pass it as a string that can be converted into a function. For example, \"lambda x: x**2\". \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. math_gcd with a=48, b=36\n2. estimate_derivative with function=\"lambda x: x**2\", x=5\n\nI think that's the correct approach. The user might need to adjust based on how the tool expects the function to be passed, but given the information, this is the best I can do."}

The user wants two things done: first, calculate the GCD of 36 and 48, and then estimate the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5.\n\nStarting with the GCD. The math_gcd function is available, which takes two integers a and b. The parameters here are 36 and 48. Since both are positive integers, this should work. I'll need to call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36? Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Oh right, so a should be the larger one. So 48 is larger than 36, so a=48 and b=36. Wait, but the function probably just calculates GCD regardless of order, but the Euclidean algorithm works by taking the larger divided by the smaller. So maybe the function expects a to be larger. But even if not, swapping them would still give the same GCD. But to follow the parameters as described, I should set a=48 and b=36. So the first function call is math_gcd with a=48 and b=36.\n\nNext, estimating the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The estimate_derivative function is available. The parameters needed are the function, x, dx (optional), and method (optional). The function here is f(x) = x\u00b2. In Python terms, that's a lambda function like lambda x: x**2. The x value is 5. The dx is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe use a default value. The method isn't specified either. The default method for finite differences is usually the central difference, but I'm not sure what the function expects. However, the user hasn't provided dx or method, so we can omit them, assuming the function has defaults. So the parameters would be \"function\": lambda x: x**2, \"x\": 5. But how to represent the lambda in the JSON? The function parameter is of type \"any\" and requires a callable. However, JSON doesn't support lambda functions directly. Wait, the user's input is in a format where they can pass a function, but in the actual system, how is this handled? Since the user is asking for f(x) = x^2, perhaps the function parameter can be represented as a string or a lambda expression. But the problem is that in the JSON response, we need to pass the function in a way that the system can interpret. Since the example shows \"lambda x\", maybe the user expects the function to be written as a string like \"lambda x: x**2\". However, the function parameter in the JSON is of type \"any\", so perhaps the system expects a string representation. But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the user's instruction, I'll proceed to represent the function as a lambda expression in the parameters. So the second function call is estimate_derivative with function: \"lambda x: x**2\", x: 5. Assuming that the system can interpret that string as a callable function. Alternatively, if the system expects a Python lambda, but since we're generating JSON, it's more likely that the function is passed as a string. Therefore, the parameters for estimate_derivative would be {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}.\n\nSo putting it all together, the first function call is math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, then estimate_derivative with the function as lambda x: x**2 and x=5.

The user wants horizontal, so that's the value to use.\n\nNow, the order of operations. Should we rotate first then flip, or flip then rotate?

So first rotate, then flip.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly set. For rotateImageAction, the required parameter is degrees. The user specified 20, so that's good. For flipImageAction, the required parameter is flip_direction, which is 'horizontal' here. So both functions can be called with the given parameters.

So for each of them, I need to make two function calls. That would be 2 users * 2 statuses = 4 calls. Let me check the parameters again. The user.mandates function's status is a string, not an array, so each call can only handle one status. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the API allows multiple statuses in a single call, but according to the function definition, the status is a single string. So the user has to make separate calls. Therefore, for Parath, call user.mandates with name \"Parath\" and status \"pending\", then again with status \"active\". Same for Bhanu. \n\nThe partner.mandates function is for the partner's mandates, not specific users. So that's not applicable here. So the correct approach is to use user.mandates for each user and each status. So the function calls would be four in total. Let me structure the JSON accordingly."}
