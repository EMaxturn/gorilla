The user specified Mumbai as the city and today's date. Since the system note says to default to the current date in India, I should use today's date there. I don't need to get the actual current date because the function's movie_date parameter is a string in YYYY-MM-DD format. So, I'll set city to \"Mumbai\" and movie_date to today's date. The other parameters aren't mentioned, so I'll leave them out. Let me make sure the date is correct. If today is October 25, 2023, then the date would be 2023-10-25. But since I can't check the real date, I'll just use the default as per the function's instruction, which is current date. Wait, the function's default for movie_date is current date, but the user explicitly said \"today\", so maybe I should still include it. But the user might be in a different timezone. The system note says to use India's current date. So I should calculate today's date in India. However, as an AI, I can't compute the current date, so the function probably expects the user to provide it. But the user said \"today\", so the function's default would handle it. Wait, the function's movie_date parameter has a default of current date. So if the user says \"today\", we can omit the parameter, and the function will use the current date. But the user explicitly mentioned \"today\", so maybe it's better to include the current date. However, since the function's default is already current date, including it is optional. So in this case, since the user specified \"today\", we can just rely on the default. Wait, but the system note says to default to current date in India. So maybe the function's default is set to that. Therefore, the correct call is to set city to Mumbai and not include movie_date, as the default will handle it. Wait, but the user explicitly said \"today\", so maybe we should include the current date. But how do I know what today's date is in India? Since I can't compute it, perhaps the function expects the user to provide it, but the user is asking for today's date. Hmm. The function's parameter says the default is current date, so if the user says \"today\", we can just omit the parameter. Therefore, the correct function call is get_movies with city=Mumbai. But wait, the user might be in a different timezone. The system note says to use India's current date. So regardless of the user's location, the date is based on India. But the function's default is current date, which I assume is server's time. But the system note says to default to India's current date. So perhaps the function is designed to handle that, so we don't need to specify the date. Therefore, the correct call is to pass city as Mumbai and not include movie_date.

The URL should be the base path without query parameters. The example given in the function is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So I need to replace {ip} with the provided IP address, 192.120.45.67.\n\nThen, the params parameter is a dictionary of query parameters. The user mentioned the node ID, pod, and fabric. So I need to include those in the params. The node ID is 12, pod is 10, and fabric is Network1. Also, since they want Ethernet interface stats, maybe there's a parameter for interface type. But the user didn't specify an interface name, just \"Ethernet\". The function's example might expect parameters like nodeId, pod, fabric, and maybe interfaceType or something similar.\n\nWait, the function's params are a dict, but the exact keys aren't specified in the description. The user's question includes node ID, pod, and fabric, so I'll map those to the parameters. Maybe the API expects parameters like 'nodeId', 'pod', 'fabric', and 'interfaceType' as 'Ethernet'.

Then the params would include nodeId=12, pod=10, fabric=Network1, and maybe interfaceType=Ethernet. But the user didn't mention interfaceType, just \"Ethernet interface statistics\". Maybe the interface is implied by the endpoint, or perhaps the stats are for all interfaces, but the user wants to filter by Ethernet. Since the function's parameters are a dict, I'll include the ones provided by the user and add interfaceType if needed. However, since the user didn't specify, maybe the required parameters are just nodeId, pod, and fabric. But the function's params are required, so I need to include them. The user's question includes node ID, pod, and fabric, so those should be in the params. The interface statistics might be part of the endpoint, so maybe the URL is correct as is.

The example in the function's description shows something like 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example has 'api/api'? Maybe that's a typo, but I'll follow the structure provided.\n\nThe user's API name is \"get information of an interface,\" so the endpoint might be something like /interfaceInfo. The base URL would be https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo. But I need to check if the version 6.3.1 affects the API path. Since the user didn't specify any version in the URL, maybe it's already covered by the example.\n\nNext, the parameters. The function requires a 'params' dictionary. The parameters given are fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType. These should be included in the query parameters. So the params dict would have these keys with their respective values. For example, fabricName is \"Network1\", nodeId is 12 (integer?), podId is 10 (also integer?), interfaceType is \"Ethernet\", and infoType is \"Speed\".\n\nWait, the parameters' types: nodeId and podId are numbers, so they should be integers. The function's param type is dict, so in the params, those values should be integers. The user provided them as numbers, so that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together: the URL is constructed by replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67. Then the params are the given parameters. So the function call would be requests.get with the URL and the params as a dictionary. Let me double-check the example in the function's description. The example URL is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', but maybe the correct path is with one 'api'?
