The unit isn't specified, so maybe default to Fahrenheit, but the function allows it to be optional. So I'll include the location.\n\nNext, San Francisco. The state is California, so \"San Francisco, CA\". Again, the unit is optional. The user didn't specify units, so maybe just provide the location without the unit parameter. Wait, but the function has unit as required? No, looking back, the unit is required=false. So I can omit it, and the function will use the default. \n\nSo two separate function calls: get_current_weather for each city. The parameters are location for each. The unit is not provided, so they can be left out. The function should handle that. I need to make sure the locations are correctly formatted. Boston, MA and San Francisco, CA. That's it. No other functions are needed here since the user is asking for general weather, not snow reports. So the answer should be two function calls."}
