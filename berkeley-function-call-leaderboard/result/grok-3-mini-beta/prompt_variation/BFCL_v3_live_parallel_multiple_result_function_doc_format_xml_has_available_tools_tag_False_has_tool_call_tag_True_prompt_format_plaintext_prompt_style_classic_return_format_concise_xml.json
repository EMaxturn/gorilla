There's a function for that: \"ChaFod\", which is for changing the food item.\n\nFor the food change:\n\n- The food item is \"Caesar salad\".\n\n- They want to remove anchovies, so I need to use the \"removeIngredients\" parameter.\n\nThe function parameters:\n\n- foodItem: string, required \u2013 \"Caesar salad\"\n\n- newIngredients: string, optional \u2013 Not specified, so I can omit this.\n\n- removeIngredients: string, optional \u2013 \"anchovies\"\n\n- specialInstructions: string, optional \u2013 Not specified, so omit.\n\nSo, I can call ChaFod with foodItem and removeIngredients.\n\nNext, for the drink: They want to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nThe function for drinks is \"ChaDri.change_drink\".\n\nParameters:\n\n- drink_id: string, required \u2013 This seems to be \"123\", as they say \"update my order 123\".\n\n- new_preferences: dict, required \u2013 I need to provide a dictionary of the new preferences.\n\nWhat are the new preferences? \"a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk\".\n\nSo, I need to structure this as a dictionary. Possible keys might include size, type, sweetness, milk type, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\n{\n\n  \"size\": \"large\",\n\n  \"type\": \"hot coffee\",\n\n  \"sweetness\": \"regular\",\n\n  \"milk\": \"almond milk\"\n\n}\n\nI have to make sure it's a dict. In the function call format, I need to represent it properly.\n\nNow, in the response, I need to output only the <TOOLCALL> section with the function calls.\n\nI have two functions to call: one for food and one for drink.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n  <param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n\n  ...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"func_name2\">\n\n  ...\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I'll have two <function> elements inside <functions>.\n\nFor ChaFod:\n\n- name: \"ChaFod\"\n\n- params: foodItem (string) = \"Caesar salad\"\n\n- removeIngredients (string) = \"anchovies\"\n\nFor ChaDri.change_drink:\n\n- name: \"ChaDri.change_drink\"\n\n- params: drink_id (string) = \"123\"\n\n- new_preferences (dict) = { \"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\" }\n\nIn the XML format, how do I represent a dict? I just put it as a string that represents the dict, but the instructions say: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nIn the example, it's <param name=\"param3\" type=\"type3\">value</param>, so for a dict, I should just put the dict as the value, like {\"key\": \"value\"}.\n\nI think it's fine to write it as JSON-like in the value.\n\nFinally, since I can handle both in this turn, I'll include both function calls.\n\nResponse structure:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"ChaFod\">\n\n  <param name=\"foodItem\" type=\"string\">Caesar salad</param>\n\n  <param name=\"removeIngredients\" type=\"string\">anchovies</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"ChaDri.change_drink\">\n\n  <param name=\"drink_id\" type=\"string\">123</param>\n\n  <param name=\"new_preferences\" type=\"dict\">{\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat looks good."}

The description says: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'.\" And the param description: \"The command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name, and operation command, separated by commas.\"\n\n  So, for \"turn on the air conditioner in the living room\", I need to translate this to Korean. Based on the examples:\n\n  - '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' means 'living room, air conditioner, execute' which is for turning on.\n\n  Yes, that matches.\n\n- For information on the Imjin War: This seems like a historical topic, but the user says \"up-to-date information\". The Imjin War is from the 16th century, so it's not changing. However, they might mean recent discussions or news about it. The functions available are \"HNA_WQA.search\" for general web searches and \"HNA_NEWS.search\" for news.\n\n  Since it's specified as \"up-to-date information\", \"HNA_NEWS.search\" might be appropriate if there are recent articles, or \"HNA_WQA.search\" for general web info.\n\n  I'll use \"HNA_WQA.search\" as it's for topics that change frequently, but I can adapt.\n\nNow, I need to make function calls for each of these. The system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I should call all necessary functions in this response.\n\nFormat: I must use the exact format for <TOOLCALL> with <functions> containing one or more <function> elements.\n\nEach function call needs to specify the name and params with their types.\n\nList out the function calls:\n\n1. For weather:\n\n   - Function: OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\n\n   - Params:\n\n     - location: \"Seoul, South Korea\" (type: string)\n\n     - units: \"metric\" (type: string)\n\n2. For air conditioner:\n\n   - Function: ControlAppliance.execute\n\n   - Params:\n\n     - command: \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" (type: string)  // Assuming this is the correct Korean for \"living room, air conditioner, execute\"\n\n3. For Imjin War information:\n\n   - Function: HNA_WQA.search\n\n   - Params:\n\n     - keyword: \"Imjin War\" (type: string)\n\n     - Optionally, language: maybe \"en\" if assuming English, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't specify language, so I'll keep it minimal.\n\nI need to ensure that all required params are provided.\n\nFinally, structure the response:\n\nOnly return the <TOOLCALL> section with the functions inside.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\">\n\n<param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">Seoul, South Korea</param>\n\n<param name=\"units\" type=\"string\">metric</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"ControlAppliance.execute\">\n\n<param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"HNA_WQA.search\">\n\n<param name=\"keyword\" type=\"string\">Imjin War</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct."}

It takes repo_url, and optional parameters like destination, recursive, depth.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It analyzes the repo and determines the predominant language.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It generates Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 3 and 4, as it adds, commits, and pushes changes.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 3.\n\nThe sequence I need to follow:\n\n1. First, call clone_repo to clone the repository.\n\n2. After cloning, call analyse_repo_contents to analyze it.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, call create_a_docker_file.\n\n4. Then, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n5. Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github to add, commit, and push.\n\nThe analysis function doesn't return anything directly to me; it's just a tool call. In this setup, I have to make function calls sequentially, and the system will handle the responses.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I might need to output multiple function calls in one response if they are chained.\n\nIn the response format, I can include multiple <function> tags inside <functions>.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file, they depend on the analysis. But I don't have the analysis results yet. I need to call analyse_repo_contents first, then use its output for the next steps.\n\nIn this system, I have to make calls one by one, and presumably, the system will provide results after each call.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nSo, I should start with the first function and let the system handle the sequence.\n\nIn my response, I need to output all necessary function calls for this turn.\n\nTo be precise, I should output the first function call, and then in subsequent turns, based on results, output the next ones. But the instructions say: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nFor now, since I don't have the analysis, I can only start with cloning and analyzing.\n\nThe user specified to do all in sequence, so I need to plan for all.\n\nPerhaps I can output multiple calls, assuming the system will execute them in order.\n\nLooking at the format, I can have multiple functions in one <TOOLCALL>.\n\nTo keep it logical, I should output them in order.\n\nFirst, clone the repo. For that, I need repo_url: \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\nI can use default for other parameters.\n\nAfter cloning, the repo will be in some directory, say the current one, so for analyse_repo_contents, I need directory_name. The function description says: \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nFor clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it clones to the current working directory, probably with the repo name.\n\nAssuming it's cloned to a directory named after the repo, like \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nSo, for analyse_repo_contents, I can use directory_name as \"nodejs-welcome\" or whatever the default is. The user didn't specify, so I'll assume it's the repo name.\n\nIn clone_repo, the destination is optional, so if not specified, it's the current directory, but typically Git clones into a subdirectory.\n\nTo be safe, I'll use the repo name as the directory.\n\nThen, for create_a_docker_file, it needs directory_name, which should be the same as for analysis.\n\nSame for create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\nFinally, push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name.\n\nIn one response, I can list all the functions in sequence.\n\nThe system might expect me to call one at a time, but the format allows multiple.\n\nTo fulfill the request, I'll include all in this response.\n\nSo, the sequence:\n\n1. <function name=\"clone_repo\"> with repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\n2. <function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\"> with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\" (assuming)\n\n3. <function name=\"create_a_docker_file\"> with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n4. <function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\"> with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\" and other params if needed, but defaults are fine.\n\n5. <function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\"> with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", and perhaps a commit message.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, I need a commit message. The user didn't specify, so I can use a default like \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML\".\n\nAlso, branch_name, etc., can be default.\n\nAlright, let's outline the TOOLCALL:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"clone_repo\">\n\n<param name=\"repo_url\" type=\"string\">git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\">\n\n<param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>  // Assuming this is the directory name\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n\n<param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n\n<param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n\n<param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n\n<param name=\"commit_message\" type=\"string\">Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files based on analysis</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nIs this correct? The create_a_docker_file and others depend on the analysis, but since I don't have the analysis yet, perhaps I should only call up to analyse_repo_contents first.\n\nThe instructions say to continue until I can fulfill, so maybe the system will handle it.\n\nTo be precise, perhaps I should only call the first one now.\n\nThe prompt: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI think it's okay to output all, as I'm assuming the order.\n\nPerhaps the system will execute them sequentially.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nOne potential issue: for create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has optional params like image_name, which might depend on the analysis, but the function says \"use latest if not provided\", so it's okay.\n\nSimilarly for Dockerfile.\n\nSo, I'll go with this."}

It takes \"degrees\" as an integer, which should be between 0 and 360. So, for 20 degrees, I can use degrees=20.\n\n- flipImageAction: This flips an image in the specified direction, either 'horizontal' or 'vertical'. So, for horizontal flip, I can use flip_direction='horizontal'.\n\nI need to make function calls for both actions. The system prompt says I can make one or more function calls in a single response.\n\nThe user didn't specify any image details, like the image path or data. Looking at the functions:\n\n- rotateImageAction requires \"degrees\" (which we have), and optionally \"image_format\" and \"keep_original\". But it doesn't explicitly require an image input in the params listed. In the description, it says \"Rotates the image clockwise...\", but the params don't include an image parameter. This might imply that the image is assumed to be in context, or perhaps it's handled externally.\n\n- flipImageAction also doesn't have an image parameter in its params.\n\nThis is odd. In a real system, you'd need to specify which image to operate on, but based on the provided functions, they don't require it. I'll assume that the functions know which image to use, as per the context.\n\nSo, I need to call:\n\n1. rotateImageAction with degrees=20.\n\n2. flipImageAction with flip_direction='horizontal'.\n\nThe order might matter. Typically, you'd perform one operation after the other, but since these are separate calls, I should just list them.\n\nIn the response format, I need to put them in <TOOLCALL> tags.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So, I can call both functions in this response.\n\nFormat: <TOOLCALL><functions><function name=\"func_name\">...</function><function name=\"other_func\">...</function></functions></TOOLCALL>\n\nI need to specify the types for parameters. For rotateImageAction:\n\n- degrees: type=\"integer\", value=20\n\nFor flipImageAction:\n\n- flip_direction: type=\"string\", value=\"horizontal\"\n\nThat covers it.\n\nResponse should only contain the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else.\n\nSo, my response will be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"rotateImageAction\">\n\n<param name=\"degrees\" type=\"integer\">20</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"flipImageAction\">\n\n<param name=\"flip_direction\" type=\"string\">horizontal</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should consider if there's any dependency. For example, does the flip need to happen after the rotation? Since these are separate calls, the system might handle the order, or I might need to sequence them. But the prompt doesn't specify, so I'll just call both.\n\nOne potential issue: The functions might operate on the same image, so calling them sequentially could work.\n\nI think that's fine."}

This should be the category of the cultural event. The user mentioned \"music or theater events\", so I need to handle that. The function might expect a single type, but the description says \"The category of the cultural event.\" I could use something like \"music\" or \"theater\", but since it's \"or\", I might need to call it twice or choose one. The function is designed for one type per call, so I should probably make separate calls if needed. To keep it simple, I can start with one, say \"music\", and then another for \"theater\" if necessary. But the user said \"music or theater\", which might mean either. However, the function requires a specific event_type.\n\nThe user is asking for \"any music or theater events\", so I could use \"music\" as the type, or perhaps \"concert\" or \"play\", but I need to match what's expected. The description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so \"concert\" for music and \"play\" for theater might work.\n\nTo be precise, I should use values that make sense. Since it's required, I have to provide one. Maybe I can call it once for \"music\" and once for \"theater\".\n\nThe parameter is singular: \"The category of the cultural event.\" So, probably one call per type.\n\nIn the instructions, it says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nI can output multiple function calls in one response if needed.\n\nOther parameters:\n\n- city: string, required. The user specified \"San Diego, CA\", which matches the format.\n\n- date: string, optional. The user specified \"March 1st 2023\", which I need to convert to 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so '2023-03-01'.\n\nFor event_type, I need to decide what to put. Possible values aren't specified, but based on common sense, \"music\" or \"concert\" for music events, and \"theater\" or \"play\" for theater events.\n\nTo cover both, I should make two separate function calls: one for \"music\" and one for \"theater\".\n\nThat way, I can fulfill the request comprehensively.\n\nSo, my response should include two <function> elements inside <TOOLCALL>.\n\nFormat reminder:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">value</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">value</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">value</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n... for the second one\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nYes.\n\nFirst call: event_type=\"music\", city=\"San Diego, CA\", date=\"2023-03-01\"\n\nSecond call: event_type=\"theater\", city=\"San Diego, CA\", date=\"2023-03-01\"\n\nIs \"music\" the exact term? The function description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so \"concert\" might be better for music events. But the user said \"music\", so I'll go with that. Similarly, \"theater\" for theater events.\n\nI think \"music\" and \"theater\" are reasonable.\n\nAll required parameters are present: event_type, city.

It could be \"concert\" or \"play\", but the function might accept a string like \"music\" or something more specific. The description says \"The category of the cultural event\", so I should use something like \"concert\" or \"play\". Since the user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", I might need to choose one, but the function likely expects a single string. I'll go with \"concert\" as an example, but to cover both, I should use a value that fits. Actually, the user is asking for both, so perhaps I can use \"music\" or specify one. The param desc is just \"The category\", so I'll use \"concert\" for music concerts.\n\nThe function is to find events, and it takes one event_type. The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", which might imply multiple, but I have to call the function with one type. I should call it once for concerts and perhaps again if needed, but for now, I'll start with one.\n\n- city: Required. The name of the city, formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. For Los Angeles, it should be 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- date: Optional. The date of the event in 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user specified March 10th, 2023, so that's '2023-03-10'.\n\nI have all required parameters: event_type, city, and date (which is optional but we have it).\n\nWhat to use for event_type? The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\". I need to pick one. Perhaps I can call the function twice, once for each, but the instructions say to try to complete the task in the current turn, and I can make multiple function calls if needed.\n\nThe response format allows multiple functions in one <TOOLCALL>.\n\nTo be thorough, I should call it for both: first for \"concert\" and then for \"play\" or something similar.\n\nCommon categories might be \"concert\" for music and \"theater\" for plays.\n\nI'll assume \"concert\" for music and \"theater play\" or just \"play\".\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll make two separate function calls within the same <TOOLCALL>: one for event_type=\"concert\" and one for event_type=\"play\".\n\nIs \"play\" a standard category? The function description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so likely yes.\n\nNow, format the response: I need to output only the <TOOLCALL> section with the functions.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">concert</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">Los Angeles, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-03-10</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">play</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">Los Angeles, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-03-10</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems appropriate.\n\nFinally, ensure the types are correct: event_type is string, city is string, date is string.

Typically, if it's a single string, it's for one status at a time.\n\nTo get both pending and active for one user, I'd need two calls per user.\n\nThe user has two users, so that's potentially four calls: \n\n- For parath, pending\n\n- For parath, active\n\n- For bhanu, pending\n\n- For bhanu, active\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can output multiple function calls in one response, as the format allows for multiple <function> elements inside <functions>.\n\nSo, I should output all necessary calls in this response.\n\nThe function requires \"name\" as a required parameter, which we have: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\".\n\nStatuses: \"pending\" and \"active\".\n\nI need to make sure the parameter types are correct: \"name\" is string, \"status\" is string.\n\nFinal calls:\n\n1. user.mandates with name=\"parath\" and status=\"pending\"\n\n2. user.mandates with name=\"parath\" and status=\"active\"\n\n3. user.mandates with name=\"bhanu\" and status=\"pending\"\n\n4. user.mandates with name=\"bhanu\" and status=\"active\"\n\nI need to format this exactly as specified in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<param name=\"param1\" type=\"string\">value1</param>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"func_name2\">\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I'll have four <function> elements inside <functions>.\n\nEnsure that the type fields are one of: string, integer, etc. For these, all are strings.\n\nAfter these calls, if that's all, the system will handle the next part.\n\nI think that's it; no other functions are needed."}
