For Paris, since it's in France, the location should be 'Paris, France'.

First for Paris, France with language 'en', and second for Letterkenny, Ireland with category 'Technology' and language 'en'. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The state abbreviation isn't needed here since they're using country names. Also, check if the function allows 'Country' in the location. The description says 'City, Country' is acceptable.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory name might be the same as the repo name. Let's assume it's 'nodejs-welcome' unless specified otherwise. So, call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name set to 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce we have the analysis, step 2.1 requires creating a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using the same directory name as before. But wait, the analysis might determine the programming language, which could influence the Dockerfile. However, the function doesn't take the language as a parameter, so it's probably handled internally. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen step 2.2 is creating Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs directory_name, and optionally deployment_name, image_name, etc. Since the user hasn't specified these, we'll use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter creating these files, step 3 is adding all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name. But wait, the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might refer to git add. However, the push function automatically git adds changes. But the user might need to run git add first. However, the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe after creating the files, we can call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name and a commit message. But the user hasn't specified a commit message, so it's optional. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and maybe a default commit message like 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs'.\n\nWait, the steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changed files to git\" (i.e., git add). But the available functions don't have a git add function. The push function does git add automatically. So perhaps after creating the files, we need to push, which will handle adding. But the user's step 3 says to add the changed files, then commit and push. However, the push function automatically adds. So maybe the steps are: after creating the files, run git add, then commit, then push. But the available functions don't have a git add or commit function. The push function does git add and commit. So maybe the user's step 3 is covered by the push function. But the user's step 3 says to add the changes, then commit and push. However, the push function does all three: add, commit, and push. So perhaps the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github after creating the files. \n\nBut the user's step 3 is separate from step 4. Wait, the steps are:\n\n3. add all changed file to git changes \n\n4. commit / push to repo\n\nBut the push function does both commit and push. However, the user might have intended to first add the changes (git add), then commit, then push. But since the push function automatically adds, maybe the user's step 3 is redundant. However, the functions available don't have a separate git add. So perhaps the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github, which will handle adding, committing, and pushing. \n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with the given URL.\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents on the directory.\n\n3. create_a_docker_file in the directory.\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file in the directory.\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with the directory and a commit message.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add the changes, then step 4 to commit and push. However, the push function does all three. So maybe the user's steps are a bit redundant, but we need to follow them as per the given instructions. \n\nBut the functions don't have a separate git add, so the push function is the way to go. Therefore, after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name and a commit message. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n- clone_repo with repo_url.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\n- create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and a commit message.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add the changes, which might be covered by the push function's git add. So the functions are called in order."}

The get_relevant_classes function seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to true. The search_string should be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll need to call it twice, once for each method. Both require the class_name as AbstractCellHandler and the method_name as setCellValue and getCellValue respectively. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe the include_private parameter should be considered, but since the methods are overridden, perhaps they are public. But the user didn't specify, so maybe leave include_private as default (false) unless told otherwise.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error about getNumericValue() in CellResult. Maybe CellResult doesn't have that method, so they need to check if there's a related class that does. But the first part of the query is to find classes related to CellResult, so using get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true should help find possible classes.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true. Then call get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue and getCellValue methods."}

I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size 5.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format. The example formats are like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. So I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe we can omit it or default to Celsius.

But the function might require a single event_type. Wait, the function's event_type is a string, so maybe I need to handle both. However, the function might not support multiple types at once. Maybe I should call it twice, once for each event type. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants both, so I need to check if the function can take multiple values.
