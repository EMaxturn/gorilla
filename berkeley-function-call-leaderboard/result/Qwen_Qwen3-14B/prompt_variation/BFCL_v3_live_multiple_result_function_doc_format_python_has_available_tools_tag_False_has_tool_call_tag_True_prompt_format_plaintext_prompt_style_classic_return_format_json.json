The user wants an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nThe first function, uber.ride, requires loc in the format 'Street Address, City, State', which matches the user's address. The parameters needed are loc, type, and time. The user provided all three: loc is the full address, type is 'Plus', and time is 10. So that fits.\n\nThe second function, uber.ride2, uses loc as 'City, State' and also includes type and time. But the user's loc is a full street address, not just city and state. So ride2 might not be suitable here because the loc format doesn't match. Also, the default time is 10, which the user specified, but the loc is more detailed than what ride2 expects.\n\nSo the correct function to call is uber.ride with the provided parameters. The other function doesn't fit the loc format. No missing parameters here, everything the user needs is there."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's HNA_WQA.search which is for retrieving up-to-date info via web search. The parameters needed are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user specified the keyword as '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result format as text, and max results as 10. The language isn't mentioned, but the default is EN. However, since the query is in Korean, maybe the user prefers Korean results. But the function's default language is EN. Wait, the user's instruction is in Korean, but the function's language parameter defaults to EN. Should I set it to KO? The function's description says the language preference for the search results. The user might want the results in Korean, but the function's default is EN. Hmm, but the user didn't specify the language, so maybe stick with the default unless told otherwise. However, the query is in Korean, so maybe the user expects Korean results. But the function's parameters have a default of 'EN', so unless specified, it might return English results. But the user might not have specified, so perhaps it's safer to use the default. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle Korean. Wait, the function's keyword is in Korean, so maybe the search is done in Korean. But the language parameter is for the results. The user might want the results in Korean. But the default is EN. Hmm, but the user hasn't specified, so maybe we should use the default. However, the user's query is in Korean, so maybe the results should be in Korean. But the function's default is EN. Maybe the user expects Korean results, so I should set the language to 'KO'. But the function's parameters don't mention if 'KO' is an option. Wait, the language parameter's default is 'EN', but maybe it can take other values. The function's description says \"language preference for the search results\", so perhaps 'KO' is acceptable. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe it's better to use the default. Alternatively, since the query is in Korean, maybe the user wants the results in Korean. But without explicit instruction, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the user's request is to search with the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', which is Korean, so the search is likely intended to be in Korean. Therefore, setting the language to 'KO' might be appropriate. But the function's default is 'EN', so unless specified, it might not. But the user hasn't mentioned the language, so maybe we should proceed with the default. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle Korean searches regardless of the language parameter. This is a bit unclear, but given the user's instruction, the main parameters are keyword, result_format, and max_results. The language might be left as default. So the function call would be HNA_WQA.search with keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format 'text', max_results 10, and language default. So the parameters would be {\"keyword\": \"\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780\", \"result_format\": \"text\", \"max_results\": 10}. The language is not specified, so it's omitted, using the default. That should fulfill the user's request."}

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The functions available include searching archival memory and recall memory. Since the user didn't provide the birthday info, I should check the archival memory first. Maybe there's a record there. If not, perhaps the recall memory has it. But if neither has it, I can't proceed without that info.\n\nAssuming I find the birthday in the archival memory, I can then use the send_message function to send the congrats. But wait, the user didn't specify the recipient's email or phone number. The send_message function requires a recipient parameter. The default is 'default@example.com', but that might not be correct. If the user didn't provide the recipient details, I can't use the default because it's not Shishir's. So maybe I need to ask the user for the recipient info. But the user's question doesn't include that. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the user might expect me to know Shishir Patil's contact info, but that's not provided. So I need to check if the archival or core memory has that. If not, I can't send the message. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and didn't provide necessary details. In that case, I should inform them. But according to the instructions, if parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user might have expected me to use existing data. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe functions available are send_message, core_memory_append, core_memory_replace, archival_memory_search, etc. So first, I need to search for Shishir Patil's birthday. Let's use archival_memory_search with the query \"Shishir Patil birthday\". If that returns the date, then proceed. Then, send a message using send_message with the message content, recipient (if available), and priority. But without the recipient's details, I can't fill that in. The user didn't provide it, so maybe the function's default is acceptable, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the core memory's human section has the recipient info. Let me check core memory. If the human section has Shishir's contact info, then use that. Otherwise, I can't proceed.\n\nSo the steps are: 1. Search archival memory for Shishir Patil's birthday. 2. If found, check core memory for recipient info. 3. If recipient is available, send message. If not, inform user that recipient details are missing. But the user's question didn't specify the recipient, so maybe they expect me to use the default, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to send it to Shishir Patil, so the recipient should be his email or phone number. But without that info, I can't proceed. Therefore, I need to inform the user that the recipient's details are missing. However, the user might have expected me to know it, but according to the functions, I can't assume that. So the answer would be to first search for the birthday, then check for recipient info, and if missing, point it out."}

It requires bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided most of these: bank name is U.S. Bank, account number is given, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview needs to be a summary, which the user has some data for: deposits, withdrawals, balances. \n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview parameter expects a dictionary with totals and counts. The user provided total deposits ($7,132.76), withdrawals ($5,927.40), starting and ending balances. Maybe I can structure that into a dict. Also, the TotalTransactions.calculate function might help compute some of these, but the user already provided the totals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function could be used, but that requires a list of individual transactions. The user hasn't provided those, only totals. So perhaps BankStatementOverView is the way to go, using the provided totals as the transaction overview. \n\nI should call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters.

Wait, but the user didn't mention the number of transactions. Hmm. Maybe just include the totals they provided. The function's transaction_overview is a summary, so maybe that's acceptable. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned \"include a summary of transactions for this period,\" which might be covered by the transaction_overview in BankStatementOverView. So the function call would include all the required parameters. Let me check the parameters again: bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, transaction_overview. All are provided except transaction_overview's structure. The user's data can be formatted into that. \n\nSo the tool call would be to BankStatementOverView with the given details and the transaction_overview as a dictionary with the totals provided."}

Hmm, but the function's parameters list cinema_hall as required? Wait, checking the function definition again: the Args for get_movies have city (str) and cinema_hall (str) as required.

No, looking at the function's Args, cinema_hall is listed as a required parameter without a default. So, the user hasn't provided that. \n\nBut the user is asking for movies in Noida today.

However, they didn't specify a name, so I'll use the default. Wait, but the hostname given is a URL. The host parameter should be the hostname or IP address. The function's example includes 'localhost' or an IP. The user's hostname is http://plga.ca, but maybe they meant the host is plga.ca without the http. Or maybe they included the protocol. Hmm, but the function expects a hostname or IP, so perhaps just plga.ca. But the user input is http://plga.ca. Should I include the protocol? The function's description says host is the server's hostname or IP address, so maybe the protocol isn't needed. But the user provided it as is. Maybe they intended the full URL, but that's not standard for a host. Maybe it's a mistake. However, I should use the value as provided unless there's a reason to adjust it. So, the host parameter would be 'http://plga.ca'? Wait, but in the function's example, it's 'localhost' or '192.168.1.10', which are hostnames without protocols. So perhaps the user made a mistake including http. But since the user provided it that way, maybe they want it as is. Alternatively, maybe they meant the host is plga.ca, and the http is part of the URL. But the function's host parameter is for the server's hostname or IP, so the protocol isn't part of that. So perhaps the correct host is 'plga.ca'. However, the user wrote 'http://plga.ca', so maybe they intended the full URL. But that's not standard. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the function's parameters expect a host, so I'll take the user's input as given. So, host is 'http://plga.ca', and the api_key is '1234324'.

{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, Restaurants_2_ReserveRestaurant, and RideSharing_2_GetRide. The user is asking to find restaurants, so the Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which I think corresponds to the price_range parameter. The default is 'moderate', but maybe 'intermediate' is another option. Wait, the function's price_range default is 'moderate', so perhaps the user means moderate. But the user specified \"intermediate,\" which might not be a valid option. Hmm, but maybe the function accepts 'intermediate' as a valid price_range. The description says \"desired price range for the restaurant's offerings,\" so maybe it's a free text field. Alternatively, maybe the valid options are 'low', 'moderate', 'high', but the user used 'intermediate'. I'll have to use 'intermediate' as the price_range since that's what the user said.\n\nThe location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. The user just said New York, so I need to assume the state. Since New York City is in New York State, the location should be 'New York, NY'. \n\nThe user also wants outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it out or set to a default. Wait, the category is a required parameter because in the function's Args, category is listed without a default. Wait, looking back: the function's Args for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have category as a required parameter (no default mentioned), location is required (no default), price_range has a default of 'moderate', and the other two are optional with defaults. So the user didn't specify a category, but the function requires it. Wait, that's a problem. The user didn't mention a cuisine category. But the function requires the category parameter. So maybe the user didn't provide enough info. However, the user's query is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating, without specifying cuisine. So perhaps the category can be left out? Wait, no, the function's parameters show that category is required. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the function definition for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants:\n\nArgs:\n    category (str): The type of cuisine or food category offered by the restaurant.\n    location (str): The city where the restaurant is located...\n    price_range (str, default='moderate')\n    has_vegetarian_options (bool, default=False)\n    has_seating_outdoors (bool, default=False)\n\nSo category is a required parameter. But the user didn't specify a category. That's an issue. However, maybe the user is okay with any category, so perhaps the category can be left as a wildcard or omitted. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the function call would need a category. But the user hasn't provided one. So this is a problem. However, maybe the function allows an empty string or a wildcard. But the function's description says \"category (str): The type of cuisine...\" which implies it's required. Therefore, the user's query is missing a required parameter. But the user might not know the category and just wants any restaurant. In that case, maybe the assistant should proceed with a default or empty string. However, the function might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make an assumption, but that's risky. \n\nWait, the user's original request is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Since the category isn't specified, perhaps the assistant should proceed without it, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't call the function without the category. But the user didn't provide it. So the assistant should point out that the category is missing. However, the user might not have specified it, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant needs to inform the user that the category is required. But according to the problem statement, if the question lacks parameters, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible, otherwise point out missing parameters. \n\nBut in this case, the user hasn't provided the category, which is required. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. However, maybe the category can be omitted, but the function requires it. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. But the user might not know the category. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a wildcard or leave it as an empty string. But according to the function's parameters, category is a required string. So the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the category is missing. However, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating, but without a category. So the assistant can't call the function because the category is required. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. But the user might not have provided it. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct action is to note that the category is missing. But the user might not have specified it. However, the assistant is supposed to make the function call if possible. But since the category is required and not provided, the assistant can't make the call. Therefore, the answer should be that the category is missing. But the user's question doesn't mention a category. So the assistant should respond that the category is required but not provided. However, the user might not know the category and just wants any restaurant. But the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can make an assumption. For example, if the category is not specified, maybe the function allows it to be omitted. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the assistant must include it. Since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant can't proceed.

The user mentioned \"book on the 15th of July, staying for 5 days.\" The check-in date is July 15th, and the stay is 5 days. The Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function requires check_in_date, stay_length, location, and number_of_rooms. However, the user didn't specify the location or the number of rooms. The location is needed, but the user hasn't provided it. Wait, maybe they mentioned the studio sessions location? The original query doesn't specify the city or location for the hotel. So, the parameters are missing. The user might have forgotten to mention the location. Since the function requires location, but it's not provided, I can't proceed with the reservation. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use a default value, but the Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function has location as default 'dontcare', but that's not helpful. Wait, looking at the function definition for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel: the location parameter has a default of 'dontcare', but that's probably a placeholder. However, without knowing the actual location, the function can't be called properly. The user might have intended to provide the location but missed it. Since the query doesn't have the location, I need to point out that the required parameter is missing. Alternatively, maybe the user mentioned the studio sessions location elsewhere, but in the given query, there's no info. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the location in the question. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe there's a typo here. The \"2staying\" might be \"staying for 5 days\" but the location isn't mentioned. So, the necessary parameters for the hotel reservation are check_in_date (which is 2023-07-15), stay_length (5 days), but location and number_of_rooms are missing. The user hasn't provided the location, so the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the location is required but not provided."}

The user wants two things: songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic' and tracks released around six years ago, considering the current year is 2023.\n\nFirst, for the first part, finding songs similar to 'The New Classic' album. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can be used here. The parameters for this function include artist, album, genre, and year. Since the user mentioned the album name, I should set the album parameter to 'The New Classic'. The other parameters like artist, genre, and year can be set to 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify them. This should retrieve songs from the same album or similar ones.\n\nNext, the second part is about tracks released around six years ago. Since the current year is 2023, six years ago would be 2017. So, I need to set the year parameter to 2017. However, the function's year parameter expects a four-digit number. The user said \"around six years ago,\" so maybe considering a range like 2016-2018? But the function might not support a range. The default is 'dontcare', but here we need to specify the year. Maybe use 2017 as the exact year. So, another call to Music_3_LookupMusic with year=2017 and other parameters as 'dontcare'.\n\nWait, but the user wants both things: similar to the album and released around six years ago. So maybe combine both criteria in a single function call? Let me check the function parameters again. The function allows specifying album and year. So, setting album to 'The New Classic' and year to 2017. But does that make sense? The user might want songs similar to the album's style, regardless of the year, but also songs from around 2017. However, the function's parameters are separate. So perhaps two separate calls: one for the album and one for the year. Alternatively, if the function can handle both, but the user might need both conditions. However, the function's parameters are individual, so combining them might narrow down the results. But the user might want two separate sets of results. Therefore, two separate function calls would be better. \n\nFirst call: album='The New Classic', other parameters as 'dontcare' to find similar songs. Second call: year='2017' to find tracks from around six years ago. That makes sense. So the answer would be two calls to Music_3_LookupMusic with those parameters."}

The user mentioned \"debit card\" as the payment method, so that's the source. The receiver is the landlord's email. The amount is $154, but the note says the amount should be in USD.

The user wants to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. So I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, Music_3_LookupMusic seems relevant because it retrieves songs based on criteria like album, year, etc. The parameters include album, year, genre, and artist. The user specified the album name and the year, so I can use those parameters.\n\nThe album is 'High Expectations', so I'll set the album parameter to that. For the year, they mentioned 2019. The function's year parameter accepts an integer or 'dontcare', so 2019 is valid. Since they want either the album or the year, but the function allows combining these parameters, I can include both. However, the user's request is to get songs from the album or from 2019. But the function might require both parameters to be specified. Wait, the function's default for album and year is 'dontcare', so if I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, it would look for songs that are both on that album and from 2019. But the user wants either/or. Hmm, maybe the function can handle that. Wait, no, the parameters are separate. If I set album to 'High Expectations', it would find songs from that album regardless of the year. But the user also wants songs from 2019, which might not be on that album. So maybe I need two separate calls? Or can I use the same function with different parameters?\n\nWait, the user said \"or alternatively\", so they want songs from the album OR songs from 2019. But the Music_3_LookupMusic function can take multiple parameters. However, if I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, it would return songs that are both on that album and released in 2019. But the user wants either. So maybe I need to make two separate calls: one with the album name and another with the year. But the function allows specifying both, but that would narrow down the results. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle OR logic if one of the parameters is set. Wait, the function's parameters are for filtering. If I set album to 'High Expectations', it would return all songs from that album, regardless of the year. If I set the year to 2019, it would return all songs from 2019, regardless of the album. But how to combine them? The function might not support OR between album and year. So perhaps the user's request can't be fully captured with a single function call. But maybe the user is okay with getting songs from the album, and if that's not available, then songs from 2019. But the function can only take one set of parameters. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to get songs that are either from the album or from 2019. But the function might not support that. \n\nWait, looking at the parameters again: the function allows setting album, year, genre, artist. If I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, it would return songs that are on that album and released in 2019. But the user wants songs from the album OR from 2019. So perhaps two separate calls are needed. But the user might not have specified which one to prioritize. However, the user might be okay with getting songs from the album first, and if that's not possible, then songs from 2019. But the system can only make one function call at a time. So maybe the best approach is to first look up the album 'High Expectations' and if that returns results, use those. If not, then look up songs from 2019. But since the user is asking for either, perhaps the first step is to check the album. However, the user might not have provided enough parameters. Wait, the function Music_3_LookupMusic can take album and year as parameters. So if I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 'dontcare', that would get all songs from that album regardless of the year. Then, if that returns no results, maybe the user would want to look for songs from 2019. But the user's request is to get either. So maybe the first call is to look up the album, and if that's not possible, then the year. But the user hasn't specified which one to prioritize. However, the user's message says \"or alternatively\", which suggests that the album is the primary choice, and if that's not available, then the year. But the system can only make one function call. So perhaps the best approach is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 'dontcare'. If that returns songs, then proceed. If not, then call with year 2019 and album 'dontcare'. But since the user hasn't specified which one to do first, but the initial request is to hear a track from the album or any song from 2019, the first step is to check the album. So the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare'. Then, if that returns no results, the next step would be to call with year 2019. But the user's question is to make the necessary function calls. Since the user hasn't provided the parameters for the year in the first call, but the function allows for that. So the first function call is to look up the album. Then, if needed, the second call for the year. However, the user's question is to make the function calls based on the current input. Since the user hasn't specified which one to prioritize, but the initial request is to get either, the assistant should make the first call for the album and then the second for the year. But the system might require making both calls. However, the user's message is a single query, so the assistant should make the necessary function calls. But the user might not have provided all parameters. Wait, the user's request is to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. So the assistant needs to retrieve songs that are either from that album or from 2019. However, the Music_3_LookupMusic function can take multiple parameters, but the way it's structured, it's an AND condition. So if you set album and year, it's looking for songs that are both. Therefore, to get OR, you need two separate calls. So the assistant should make two function calls: one with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare', and another with album 'dontcare' and year 2019. Then, the system can combine the results. But the user's question is to make the function calls. So the assistant should generate both function calls."}

However, the function's description says \"category of the cultural event,\" so perhaps each call is for one type. But the user might want both. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if specified. Wait, looking at the function's parameters, event_type is a single string. So perhaps I need to make two separate calls: one for \"concert\" and one for \"play\". But the user might prefer to get both in one go. Alternatively, maybe the function allows a list, but the parameters don't indicate that. The function's Args show event_type is a str, not a list. So perhaps the user's request can be handled by making two separate function calls. However, the user might not mind if the system checks both types. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept \"concert or play\" as the event_type. But the function's description says \"category of the cultural event,\" so maybe it's better to make two separate calls. However, the user might not have specified which one they want, so the system should check both. But since the function can only take one event_type at a time, I need to call it twice. But the user's question is to find events, so maybe the assistant should first find concerts and then plays. However, the user might not have specified which one, so the assistant should check both. But the function can only take one event_type per call. Therefore, I need to make two separate calls. However, the user might not have the parameters for both.

Then another call with event_type \"play\", same city and date. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if the event_type is a comma-separated string, but the parameters don't mention that. The function's Args specify event_type as a str, so it's likely a single value. Therefore, the correct approach is to make two separate function calls for each event type. However, the user might not have specified which one they want, so the assistant should check both. Therefore, the answer would be two function calls. But the user's question is to \"look for a cultural event in New York on March 10th, preferably a music concert or a play.\" So the assistant should first check for concerts and then plays. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type \"concert\", city \"New York, NY\", date \"2023-03-10\".\n\nSecond, call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type \"play\", city \"New York, NY\", date \"2023-03-10\".\n\nBut the user might not have specified the date format. The function's date parameter is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user said March 10th, which would be 2023-03-10. Assuming the current year is 2023. However, if the current year is different, but since the user didn't specify the year, maybe the function expects the current year.

The user provided all these: where_to is Austin, TX, number_of_adults is 4, check_in is 05/12/2023, check_out is 05/18/2023. So the function call would be to Hotels_2_BookHouse with those parameters. But do they need to search first? The question says they need to book, so maybe they already have the house details. But the functions don't mention needing a house ID or name. Maybe the BookHouse function is for confirming the reservation once the details are known. Since the user hasn't mentioned searching yet, perhaps the correct step is to book directly. However, maybe the system requires searching first to ensure availability. But the user's message is about booking, so I should proceed with the BookHouse function. Let me check the parameters again. The number_of_adults is 4, which is allowed. The dates are in the correct format. So the function call should be Hotels_2_BookHouse with those parameters."}

The date is this Friday. \n\nWait, the date needs to be in ISO format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. But the current date isn't specified, so I might need to calculate this Friday's date. However, the user didn't provide the current date, so maybe the system expects the function to handle that or the user expects the assistant to know the current date. Since the function requires the date, I have to include it. But since the current date isn't given, perhaps the assistant should assume today's date or the user expects the function to handle it. However, the user just said \"this Friday,\" so maybe the assistant should use that as the date parameter. But the function requires a specific date. Hmm, maybe the assistant should proceed with the given information, even if the date is relative. Alternatively, if the date is missing, the function can't be called. Wait, the user didn't specify the exact date, just \"this Friday.\" The function requires the date in ISO format. So, the assistant might need to calculate that date based on the current date. But since the current date isn't provided, perhaps the assistant can't determine the exact date. However, in a real scenario, the system might have access to the current date. Since the user is asking to book this Friday, the assistant should proceed with the information given, even if the exact date isn't specified. Wait, but the function requires the date parameter. So, the assistant needs to figure out the date. Let's assume that \"this Friday\" refers to the upcoming Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, then this Friday is two days away. But without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute the exact ISO date. However, the user might expect the assistant to handle that, or maybe the function can accept a relative date. But according to the function's parameters, the date is required in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that the date is missing. But the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. Since the function requires an absolute date, the assistant can't proceed without knowing the exact date. However, in the context of the problem, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the given information, even if the date is relative. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the current date to calculate this Friday. But since the current date isn't provided, perhaps the assistant can't do that. Wait, but the user is asking to book this Friday, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the date parameter as \"this Friday\" in the format required. However, the function requires a specific date. This is a problem. The user didn't provide the exact date, so the function can't be called. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the date is missing. But the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. Maybe the assistant is supposed to assume that the current date is known. For example, if today is 2023-10-10 (Tuesday), then this Friday is 2023-10-13. But without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute that. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that the date is missing. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. So in this case, the date is missing. But the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. So the assistant might need to calculate the date based on the current date. But since the current date isn't provided, the assistant can't. Therefore, the function can't be called because the date parameter is missing. However, the user might expect the assistant to handle that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed with the given information, even if the date is relative. But according to the function's parameters, the date is required in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the date is missing. Wait, but the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a specific date relative to today.

But the user might expect the assistant to handle that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the given information, even if the date is not in the correct format. But that's not possible. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the date is missing. However, the user provided \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date.

The user's question lacks the journey_start_time parameter. Therefore, I can't proceed with booking without that. However, maybe the user intended to use the FindTrains function first to get available times, then book. But the user is asking to book directly. So perhaps the answer is that the parameters are missing, specifically the journey_start_time. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 15th, but the start time is not specified. Therefore, the function call can't be made because the required parameter is missing.

So perhaps the user is the current user, and the function can be called without the user_id. But the user provided their user ID, which might be redundant. \n\nIn this case, the user's message says \"My user ID is 12345,\" so they want to retrieve tokens for that user. The first function allows specifying the user_id, so that's the one to use. Therefore, the correct function call is to get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=False. However, the user might want all tokens, including revoked ones, but they didn't specify. So the default is False. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function is the right one, but the user_id is not needed. But the user provided it, so perhaps the first function is the correct one. \n\nSo the final answer is to call CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). So, I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' which requires the type of experience or education and the name. The user specified \"education\" and the university name. So maybe that's the right function. The parameters are experience_or_education_type and experience_or_education_name. \n\nWait, the function 'detail_experience_and_education' is for retrieving detailed info about a specific experience or education. The user wants details about Adriel's education at UNS. So I should set experience_or_education_type to 'education' and experience_or_education_name to 'Universitas Sebelas Maret'. \n\nAlternatively, there's the 'experiences_and_education' function, but that seems to list them rather than detail a specific one. The user is asking for details, not a list. So the first function is better. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly set. The function's args are experience_or_education_type (required) and experience_or_education_name (optional, default 'Not specified'). Since the user mentioned UNS, that should be the name. So the function call would be detail_experience_and_education with type 'education' and name 'Universitas Sebelas Maret'."}

Let me check the available functions. There's set_alarm which can take a time in various formats, including with a date. The parameters are alarm_time and purpose. The user mentioned waking up for a meeting, so the purpose could be \"meeting\" or \"wake up\". The date is provided as 2023-12-01, so the alarm_time should be \"2023-12-01 07:00:00\" in the YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. The function's example includes dates, so that's valid. I should call set_alarm with that time and purpose as \"meeting\" or \"wake up\". The default purpose is \"reminder\", but the user specified a meeting, so better to set it explicitly. So the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time \"2023-12-01 07:00:00\" and purpose \"meeting\"."}
