So, I can use 'foodItem' as \"Caesar salad\" and 'removeIngredients' as \"anchovies\".\n\n- ChaDri.change_drink: This is for changing a drink. It requires 'drink_id' as a string and 'new_preferences' as a dict.\n\nFor the drink: The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. So, 'drink_id' is \"123\", and 'new_preferences' should be a dictionary like {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nThe function name is \"ChaDri.change_drink\", which might be a typo or specific naming, but I'll use it as is.\n\nI need to make function calls for both changes.\n\nThe response format must be exactly as specified: <functions> followed by the function elements.\n\nSince there are two separate things, I should call both functions in one response.\n\nStructure:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"ChaFod\">\n\n  <param name=\"foodItem\" type=\"string\">Caesar salad</param>\n\n  <param name=\"removeIngredients\" type=\"string\">anchovies</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"ChaDri.change_drink\">\n\n  <param name=\"drink_id\" type=\"string\">123</param>\n\n  <param name=\"new_preferences\" type=\"dict\">{\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nFor 'new_preferences', it's a dict, so I need to represent it as a dictionary in the XML-like format.

Probably, it's something like \"metric\".\n\nThe user asked for two locations: Guangzhou and Beijing. But the function only takes one location per call.

Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n2. Turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, the one that matches is \"ControlAppliance.execute\". This function is for controlling home appliances.\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- It requires a \"command\" parameter, which is a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\n\n- Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- Another example: '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine.\n\nThe user has two separate commands in one sentence. I need to call the function for each command separately because each function call can only handle one command.\n\nThe function's params only have one required parameter: \"command\", which is a string. So, for each action, I should make a separate function call.\n\nFirst command: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nSecond command: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nI need to format my response with the exact XML-like structure specified:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"ControlAppliance.execute\">\n\n<param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">value</param>\n\n</function>\n\n...\n\n</functions>\n\nI should include multiple <function> tags if needed.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

Remember, I should only output function calls in the specified XML-like format and nothing else.\n\nLet's match each request to the available functions:\n\n- For the weather: The function \"OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\" is perfect. It requires a \"location\" which should be 'Seoul, South Korea', and \"units\" as 'metric' for Celsius.\n\n- For turning on the air conditioner: The function \"ControlAppliance.execute\" is for controlling home appliances. The command must be in Korean. The description says: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'.\" And the param description: \"The command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name, and operation command, separated by commas. Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\"\n\n  So, for \"turn on the air conditioner in the living room\", that translates to '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'.\n\n- For information on the Imjin War: This seems like a search for historical information, but the user says \"up-to-date information\". The Imjin War is historical (1592-1598), so it's not changing, but they might mean recent discussions or news about it. The functions available are \"HNA_WQA.search\" for general web searches and \"HNA_NEWS.search\" for news.\n\n  \"HNA_WQA.search\" is for retrieving up-to-date information via web search, which could include recent articles or updates on historical topics.\n\n  So, I'll use \"HNA_WQA.search\" with the keyword \"Imjin War\".\n\nI need to make one or more function calls. Since there are multiple requests, I'll include all in this response.\n\nThe format must be exact: <functions> followed by one or more <function> tags, each with name and params.\n\nFor each function call:\n\n1. OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather:\n\n   - location: \"Seoul, South Korea\" (string)\n\n   - units: \"metric\" (string)\n\n2.

Clone the repo: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n\n2. Analyze the contents of the repo.\n\n   2.1 Create/update a Dockerfile based on the analysis.\n\n   2.2 Create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis.\n\n3. Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to map these steps to the available functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This matches step 1. It takes repo_url, and optional parameters like destination, recursive, depth.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It analyzes the repo and determines the predominant language.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It generates a Dockerfile in the specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It generates Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 3 and 4, as it adds, commits, and pushes changes.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github says it will automatically git add all changes, then commit and push. So that covers steps 3 and 4.\n\nThe order is important. I need to sequence these function calls properly.\n\nFirst, clone the repo.\n\nAfter cloning, I need to analyze the contents.\n\nThen, based on the analysis, create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML.\n\nThe functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML don't directly take the analysis as input. They just take directory_name and other params.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents will output something, but in this setup, I have to call functions sequentially, and the system will handle the outputs.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to output all necessary function calls in sequence in my response.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file, they require directory_name, which should be the one where the repo is cloned.\n\nFrom clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it clones to the current working directory. But to be precise, I should use the same directory for subsequent calls.\n\nThe user didn't specify a destination, so I'll assume it's cloned to a default location, say the current directory, and use that for other functions.\n\nIn the functions, directory_name is required for analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, etc. I need to provide a string for that.\n\nFor clone_repo, the repo_url is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. That's a valid SSH URL.\n\nAfter cloning, the directory name would typically be the repo name, like 'nodejs-welcome'. I need to specify that in subsequent calls.\n\nThe function descriptions say for analyse_repo_contents: \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nThat might be confusing. For clone_repo, if I clone to the current directory, the repository directory would be something like './nodejs-welcome'.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll assume we clone it and then use 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory_name for other functions.\n\nNow, sequencing:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with repo_url.\n\n2. Then, call analyse_repo_contents with the directory_name.\n\n3. After analysis, call create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. Then, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name and any other needed params.\n\n5. Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and other params like commit_message.\n\nThe user didn't specify commit_message, branch_name, etc., so I can use defaults.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, there are optional params like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user says \"based on the analysis\", but since I can't pass the analysis directly, I'll just call it with the directory_name and let it use defaults.\n\nSimilarly for Dockerfile.\n\nIn my response, I need to output all these function calls in one go, in the specified XML-like format.\n\nThe format is: <functions><function name=\"func_name1\">...</function><function name=\"func_name2\">...</function></functions>\n\nSo, I'll list them in order.\n\nFirst function: clone_repo\n\n- repo_url: \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\n- Other params: Not specified, so omit.\n\nSecond: analyse_repo_contents\n\n- directory_name: Probably \"nodejs-welcome\" or whatever the cloned directory is. I'll assume \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThird: create_a_docker_file\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\nFourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n- Other params: Not specified, so use defaults.\n\nFifth: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n- directory_name: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n- commit_message: Something like \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML\"\n\n- branch_name: Default, maybe \"main\"\n\n- force_push: False\n\nI need to provide values for required params.\n\nFinally, output only the functions XML, no other text."}

It can execute a search query for real-time information and has an option to filter results from after 2022.\n\n- generate_image: This is for generating a digital image based on a text prompt. The user's description sounds like it fits here, as it's a general image generation.\n\n- generate_human_image: This is specifically for human subjects, which matches since the description includes \"a masked woman.\" This might be more appropriate than the general generate_image.\n\nThe prompt is about a woman, so generate_human_image could be ideal because it's tailored for human demographics.\n\nNow, for the search part:\n\n- The user says \"since October 2021\" but then specifies \"Include only information published after the year 2022.\" So, I should use the parameter include_after_year=True to filter for post-2022.\n\n- The prompt for the search should be: \"significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021\", but filtered to after 2022.\n\nThe function's include_after_year is for after 2022, which aligns with the user's specification.\n\nFor the image:\n\n- The description is: \"a digital painting of a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style.\"\n\n- This involves a human (woman), so generate_human_image is suitable.

For that:\n\n- send_message: This sends a message to a human user.

However, the instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks...

But I can't base it on results in this turn; I have to output all necessary calls now.\n\nThe system will process one turn at a time. In this turn, I need to output the functions to call. If I need to wait for a response, I might have to call multiple functions in sequence if possible.\n\nThe user wants me to find out and then congratulate. To congratulate regardless, I can plan to call send_message after the search, but I need to output both if I can.\n\nIn the format, I can output multiple functions in one response, as shown: <functions><function>...</function><function>...</function></functions>\n\nI should call recall_memory_search first, and then send_message, because the message should be sent regardless.\n\nIf I call both in one go, the search might not have happened yet. However, the instructions don't specify sequencing beyond one response.\n\nTo fulfill the request: I need to search and then send the message. Since I can't conditionally call based on results, I should just call both.\n\nThe exact request: \"find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\"\n\nSo, minimally, I need to:\n\n1. Perform the search.\n\n2. Send the message.\n\nIn my response, I can include both function calls.\n\nFor recall_memory_search, parameters:\n\n- query: \"Shishir's birthday\" (string)\n\n- page: optional, I can set to 0 for the first page.\n\n- request_heartbeat: optional, I can set to true to allow follow-up.\n\nFor send_message:\n\n- message: \"Happy Birthday!\" (string)\n\n- recipient: optional, probably \"Shishir\" if I assume.\n\n- urgent: optional, probably false.\n\nThe user didn't specify the recipient's identifier, but in the function, it's optional.

The highest common factor is the same as GCD, so this fits for the first part. It requires two parameters: a (integer, larger one) and b (integer).\n\n  For 36 and 48, I need to check which is larger. 48 is larger than 36, so a should be 48 and b should be 36, based on the description: \"The first and larger non-negative integer\".\n\n- estimate_derivative: This estimates the derivative of a mathematical function at a specific point. The derivative gives the slope of the curve, which is how \"steep\" it is.\n\n  For the second part, f(x) = x^2 at x=5.

How do I pass a callable function in this format? Perhaps I need to assume it's a string representation, but the function spec says \"any\", which might mean I can use \"string\" for it.\n\n  In the response format, I have to use one of the specified types.

I need to choose something. Since it's \"any\", I'll use \"string\" type and put \"x^2\".\n\n- x: 5 (as float, so 5.0)\n\n- dx: I can omit it or set a default, like 0.001.\n\n- method: I can set to 'central' for better accuracy.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" For estimate_derivative, the function parameter is required, and I have to provide it.

Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 48.\n\n2. Estimate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at x = 5.\n\nI have two functions available:\n\n- math_gcd: This takes two positive integers and calculates their GCD.\n\n- estimate_derivative: This estimates the derivative of a given function at a point.\n\nFor the first part, I can use math_gcd. The parameters are:\n\n- a: integer, required, and it should be the larger one. 48 is larger than 36, so a=48, b=36.\n\nThe description says: \"The first and larger positive integer\" for a, and \"The second positive integer\" for b. So, I need to ensure a is the larger one. Yes, 48 > 36, so a=48, b=36.\n\nFor the second part, I need to use estimate_derivative. The parameters are:\n\n- function: This is a callable function. The user described it as f(x) = x^2, so I need to provide that as a lambda or something. In the function description, it says \"like the lambda x\", so I should pass something like lambda x: x**2.\n\n- x: float, required, which is 5.\n\n- dx: float, optional, default might be something small.\n\n- method: string, optional.\n\nIn the function call format, I have to specify the parameters with their types. The type for \"function\" is listed as \"any\", but in my response, I need to use one of the specified types: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. The instructions say: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n\"any\" isn't in that list. That's a problem. For estimate_derivative, the parameter \"function\" is type=\"any\", but I have to use one of the allowed types. How do I handle this?\n\nLooking back: In the available functions, it's <param name=\"function\" type=\"any\" required=\"true\">, but the instructions say to use one of those types. I need to represent it as a string, since it's a callable, maybe as a string representation of the lambda.\n\nIn the description: \"A callable function for which the derivative will be estimated, like the lambda x\"\n\nSo, perhaps I can pass it as a string: \"lambda x: x**2\"\n\nAnd specify the type as \"string\".\n\nThat might work, as it's the only way.\n\nThe user asked to do both things: first calculate GCD, then estimate the derivative.\n\nI need to make function calls for both.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I should output calls for both functions in this response.\n\nThe format is to have <functions> containing one or more <function> tags.\n\nMy response should only be the function calls in that exact XML-like format.\n\nFirst, call math_gcd with a=48 (integer), b=36 (integer).\n\nSecond, call estimate_derivative with function= \"lambda x: x**2\" (as a string), x=5 (float), and maybe default for dx and method if not specified.\n\nFor dx, it's optional, so I can omit it. Same for method.\n\nTo make it work, I should include dx with a small value, like 0.001, as it's common for derivatives.\n\nThe function description says: \"A small increment in x used to calculate the finite difference. A smaller value gives a better approximation.\"\n\nSince it's not required, I can leave it out.\n\nFor the function parameter, I'll use type=\"string\" and value=\"lambda x: x**2\".\n\nIs that accurate? In programming, lambdas are objects, but since we're passing it via text, string is fine.\n\nAlright, so structure:\n\n<functions>\n\n  <function name=\"math_gcd\">\n\n    <param name=\"a\" type=\"integer\">48</param>\n\n    <param name=\"b\" type=\"integer\">36</param>\n\n  </function>\n\n  <function name=\"estimate_derivative\">\n\n    <param name=\"function\" type=\"string\">lambda x: x**2</param>  // Using string as the type\n\n    <param name=\"x\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n\n    // Omitting dx and method\n\n  </function>\n\n</functions>\n\nx=5 is an integer, but the parameter is type=\"float\", so I should pass it as 5.0 or just 5, and specify type=\"float\".\n\nIn the function call, I can put 5 and say type=\"float\".\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nOne more thing: The user said \"first calculate... and then estimate...\", but since these are independent function calls, I can just list them in order.\n\nI don't need to add any other text; just the functions XML."}

This is the category of the cultural event. The user mentioned \"music or theater events\", so I need to handle that. The function might expect a single type, but the description says \"The category of the cultural event.\" I might need to call it once for each, but the user said \"music or theater\", which could mean either. To be precise, I should call it for both if possible, but the function is designed for one type at a time.\n\nThe function allows only one event_type per call. The user is asking for both, so I might need to make two calls: one for music and one for theater.\n\nWhat are the exact values? The user said \"music or theater\". I need to map that to possible event types. Common ones might be \"concert\" for music and \"play\" for theater, but I should use what's appropriate. The function description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so \"concert\" and \"theater\" or \"play\" could work.\n\nIn the function params, it's just \"string\", so I can use \"music\" or \"concert\", and \"theater\" or \"play\". To be safe, I'll assume \"music\" and \"theater\" are acceptable, but perhaps \"concert\" for music events.\n\nThe user said \"music or theater events\", and the function example isn't specified, so I'll go with \"music\" and \"theater\".\n\n- city: string, required. The user specified \"San Diego, CA\", which matches the format 'City, State (abbr)'.\n\n- date: string, optional. Formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user said \"March 1st 2023\", which I need to convert to '2023-03-01'.\n\nThe user wants events on that specific date, so I should include the date parameter.\n\nThe question is to find events, so I should call Events_3_FindEvents with the appropriate parameters.\n\nSince the user said \"music or theater\", I might need to call the function twice: once with event_type=\"music\" and once with event_type=\"theater\".\n\nThe function might not support \"music\" directly; it could be \"concert\". But based on the description, I'll assume \"music\" is fine, or perhaps use \"concert\" for music.\n\nTo keep it simple, I could use \"music\" as the type.\n\nThe function's desc: \"Finds and lists cultural events, such as concerts and plays\". So, for music, \"concerts\" might be better, and for theater, \"plays\".\n\nI'll make two calls:\n\n1. For concerts (music events)\n\n2. For plays (theater events)\n\nThe response format requires me to output functions in a specific XML-like format. I can include multiple <function> tags inside <functions>.\n\nAt each turn, I should try to complete the task.

The function description says \"plays\" for theater, so yes.\n\nI think that's reasonable.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">concert</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">San Diego, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-03-01</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">play</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">San Diego, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-03-01</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThat seems correct."}

I'll use \"direct\" as the value since it might fit.\n\n  The user specified \"direct bus itinerary\", so I'll set category to \"direct\".\n\nI need to make function calls in the specified XML format.\n\nThe user asked for two things, so I should make two separate function calls in one response, as the instructions say: \"you will need to make one or more function/tool calls\".\n\nFormat: <functions><function name=\"func_name\">...</function><function name=\"another\">...</function></functions>\n\nFor Events_3_FindEvents:\n\n- event_type: \"music\"\n\n- city: \"New York, NY\"\n\n- date: \"2023-05-21\"\n\nFor Buses_3_FindBus:\n\n- from_city: \"Boston, MA\"\n\n- to_city: \"New York, NY\"\n\n- departure_date: \"2023-05-21\"\n\n- num_passengers: 2\n\n- category: \"direct\" (assuming this is how to specify direct)\n\nAll required parameters are present in the user's query.\n\nMy response should only contain the function calls, nothing else.\n\nSo, I'll output:\n\n<functions>\n\n  <function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n    <param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">music</param>\n\n    <param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n\n    <param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-05-21</param>\n\n  </function>\n\n  <function name=\"Buses_3_FindBus\">\n\n    <param name=\"from_city\" type=\"string\">Boston, MA</param>\n\n    <param name=\"to_city\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n\n    <param name=\"departure_date\" type=\"string\">2023-05-21</param>\n\n    <param name=\"num_passengers\" type=\"integer\">2</param>\n\n    <param name=\"category\" type=\"string\">direct</param>\n\n  </function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThat seems correct.

It needs the city, which should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so 'Sunnyvale, CA'. The user didn't specify if it's unisex, so I can omit that parameter since it's not required.\n\nFor the second part: Book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nThis matches Services_1_BookAppointment.

This is for the unit of measurement, like Fahrenheit.\n\nThe user specified \"in fahr\", which I assume means Fahrenheit. So, for both locations, I need to use the unit as \"fahr\" or more accurately, \"fahrenheit\". I should check if the function accepts \"fahr\"; it's probably expecting something like \"fahrenheit\" or \"imperial\", but the description just says \"The unit of measurement for temperature values.\" I'll assume \"fahr\" is acceptable, but to be precise, common APIs use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit. However, since it's not specified, I'll use \"fahrenheit\" to be safe.\n\nThe user wants weather for two locations: Boston, MA and San Francisco, CA. But the function only takes one location per call. So, I need to call this function twice: once for Boston, MA and once for San Francisco, CA.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

It requires the 'name' parameter, which is a string, and 'status' which is optional.\n\n2. **partner.mandates**: This fetches mandates for a partner based on status, but it doesn't take a user name. It's for partners, not individual users.\n\nThe user's query is about specific users, not partners. So, the appropriate function is **user.mandates**.\n\nThe user wants mandates for two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\", and specifically the pending and active ones.\n\nFor each user, I might need to call **user.mandates** twice: once for \"pending\" and once for \"active\". But the function allows specifying a status, so I can call it separately for each status per user.\n\nThe function description: \"Fetches the mandates associated with a user based on the provided user name and the status of the mandates.\"\n\nI can specify the status for each call.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active mandates\", so for each user, I need both pending and active.\n\nSince I have to make function calls in this response, and I can make multiple calls, I should plan to call **user.mandates** for each combination:\n\n- For user \"parath\", status \"pending\"\n\n- For user \"parath\", status \"active\"\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status \"pending\"\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status \"active\"\n\nThat would be four calls.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

The function requires 'name', and 'status' is optional, but since the user specified statuses, I'll include them.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active\", so I need to fetch both.\n\nOne potential issue: The function might not support fetching multiple statuses in one call, so separate calls are necessary.\n\nAfter these calls, if that's all, the system will handle the rest.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY contain the function calls, nothing else.\n\nSo, I'll structure my response with multiple <function> elements inside <functions>.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1.
