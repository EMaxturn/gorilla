Since no destination is specified, we can omit the destination parameter.\n\n Step 2: Analyse the repo and create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - First, we need to analyze the repo to know the predominant programming language. However, note that the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the language. But the problem says we have to create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. But note: the `create_a_docker_file` function does not take the language as an input, so it might be that it already uses the analysis internally? However, looking at the function descriptions, the `create_a_docker_file` function only requires a directory name. Similarly, `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also requires a directory name.\n\n   But note: the step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". The function `create_a_docker_file` is described as generating a Dockerfile. We assume that it does the analysis internally? However, we have a separate function for analysis. Alternatively, the user might want us to use the analysis to decide how to create the Dockerfile? But the provided functions don't take the language as a parameter.\n\n   Let's reconsider: the function `analyse_repo_contents` might be necessary to determine the language, but the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not require the language as a parameter. So perhaps the `create_a_docker_file` function is designed to work without the language because it will do its own analysis? Or maybe the function `analyse_repo_contents` is only for information? The problem says \"based on the analysis\", so we must do the analysis. But the creation functions don't require the analysis result. \n\n   However, note the problem: \"Do all the following using the steps provided\". We are to follow the steps. Step 2 says to analyse the contents and then create. So we must call `analyse_repo_contents` to perform the analysis? But the step doesn't specify what to do with the analysis result. It might be that the `create_a_docker_file` function uses the same analysis internally? \n\n   Since the problem does not specify that we have to pass the analysis result, and the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs don't take the language, we can skip explicitly calling `analyse_repo_contents` if we assume that the creation functions will do the analysis. But the step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\", meaning we must do the analysis as part of the step.\n\n   However, note that the `analyse_repo_contents` function returns the predominant language. We don't have a function that uses that language to create the Dockerfile. So we must rely on the `create_a_docker_file` function to do the analysis? \n\n   Let me look at the function descriptions again:\n   - `create_a_docker_file`: \"Generates a Dockerfile ...\". It doesn't say it does analysis. So we must do the analysis first? But then what? The problem doesn't specify to change the behavior of the Dockerfile creation based on the analysis. It just says \"based on the analysis\", meaning the Dockerfile should be appropriate for the language. \n\n   Since the function `create_a_docker_file` is provided without parameters for language, we assume that it does the analysis internally. Similarly for the Kubernetes YAML? Actually, the Kubernetes YAML creation doesn't depend on the language, it just needs the directory name and some optional parameters.\n\n   Therefore, we can interpret step 2 as:\n     - Step 2.1: Call `create_a_docker_file` on the directory (which internally does analysis?).\n     - Step 2.2: Call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` on the directory.\n\n   But the step says \"analyse\" and then create. We are not explicitly told to call the analysis function. However, to be safe, we might want to call `analyse_repo_contents` first to ensure we have the right context? But note: the problem says we must use the functions provided. We don't have a function that uses the analysis result to create the Dockerfile. \n\n   Alternatively, the step might be broken down as:\n     - First, call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language (for our own record?).\n     - Then, call `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` without using the language because they don't require it.\n\n   But the problem says: \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". If the `create_a_docker_file` function does not use the analysis, then we cannot satisfy the requirement. So we must assume that the `create_a_docker_file` function does the analysis internally? \n\n   Given the ambiguity, and since we are to use the provided functions, I think we can skip calling `analyse_repo_contents` explicitly because the step 2.1 and 2.2 will be handled by the respective functions that might do the analysis. Alternatively, if we are to follow the steps literally, we might call `analyse_repo_contents` and then call the other functions. But the result of the analysis is not passed to the other functions.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"using the steps provided\". We are to do step 2: analyse the contents and then create. So we must do the analysis as a separate step? But the analysis step might be for our information? The problem doesn't say to use the result in the creation. It just says \"based on the analysis\", meaning the creation should be based on the analysis, which the creation functions might do internally.\n\n   Considering the above, I will do:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo\n   Step 2: \n        a) Call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language? But the problem doesn't say to output the language, just to use it for creation. Since we don't have a function that takes the language to create the Dockerfile, we rely on the `create_a_docker_file` to do the right thing. So we skip explicitly calling `analyse_repo_contents`? \n\n        However, the step says \"analyse the contents\", so we must do it. But the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the language and doesn't modify anything. So we can call it and then proceed to create the files without using the result? That seems redundant. \n\n        Alternatively, we can interpret the step as: we must create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs in a way that they are appropriate for the project, which the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` are designed to do (by doing their own analysis or by having the necessary context). \n\n        Since the problem is ambiguous, and we are to use the provided functions, we will follow:\n\n        Step 2.1: create_a_docker_file\n        Step 2.2: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n\n        without explicitly calling `analyse_repo_contents` because the step 2.1 and 2.2 are supposed to be based on the analysis and the functions are designed to do that.\n\n   But note: the step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we are required to do the analysis as a separate step? The problem doesn't say we must call the function `analyse_repo_contents` explicitly, but we have a function for it. \n\n   Let me re-read the problem: \"Do all the following using the steps provided in their respective sections.\" and step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we are to do the analysis and then create. We have a function for analysis, so we should call it. Even if we don't use the result, we are fulfilling the step.\n\n   Therefore, we will call `analyse_repo_contents` and then the creation functions.\n\n   But note: the creation functions might do the same analysis again? That's inefficient but acceptable for the purpose of this task.\n\n   So:\n     Step 2: \n        - First, call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory (which is the cloned repo). The directory name? The clone_repo function did not specify a destination, so the repo will be cloned into a directory named after the repo, i.e., \"nodejs-welcome\". So we use directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n        - Then, step 2.1: call `create_a_docker_file` with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n        - Then, step 2.2: call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n   Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes. But note: we don't have a function for \"git add\". However, the function `push_git_changes_to_github` says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes\". So we don't need a separate step for git add.\n\n   Step 4: Commit and push. We have `push_git_changes_to_github` which does commit (with a message) and push.\n\n   However, note: the function `push_git_changes_to_github` requires a directory_name and optionally a commit_message and branch_name.\n\n   We don't have a branch name, so we can omit it (default to the current branch). We do need a commit message? The step says \"commit / push\", so we must provide a commit message? But it's optional in the function. We should provide one. The problem doesn't specify the commit message, so we can make one up: e.g., \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\".\n\n   Also note: the step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", but the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does that automatically.\n\n   So step 4: call `push_git_changes_to_github` with:\n        directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n        commit_message=\"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\"\n\n   Now, let's write the function calls:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo\n        repo_url: \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\n   Step 2: \n        - analyse_repo_contents: directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n        - create_a_docker_file: directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n        - create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n        For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, we are not given any optional parameters (like deployment_name, image_name, etc.), so we use the defaults.\n\n   Step 3 and 4: \n        push_git_changes_to_github: \n            directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\"\n            commit_message=\"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\"\n\n   But note: the step 3 is \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is done by the push function.\n\n   However, the problem says step 3 is to add and step 4 is to commit/push. But our function does both. So we are covering step 3 and 4 with one call.\n\n   We must note that the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does:\n        - git add all changes\n        - git commit (with the provided message)\n        - git push\n\n   So it covers both step 3 and 4.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence of function calls:\n\n   1. clone_repo\n   2. analyse_repo_contents\n   3. create_a_docker_file\n   4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n   5. push_git_changes_to_github\n\n   We must note: the directory name for the cloned repo is the last part of the repo URL without the .git: \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n   Let's write the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n   Important: We are to output the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n   We are going to do:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n     <functions>\n        <function name=\"clone_repo\">\n            <params>\n                <param name=\"repo_url\" value=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" type=\"string\"/>\n            </params>\n        </function>\n        <function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\">\n            <params>\n                <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n            </params>\n        </function>\n        <function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n            <params>\n                <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n            </params>\n        </function>\n        <function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n            <params>\n                <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n            </params>\n        </function>\n        <function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n            <params>\n                <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n                <param name=\"commit_message\" value=\"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\" type=\"string\"/>\n            </params>\n        </function>\n     </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We are providing all required parameters. The optional ones we are skipping.\n\n   But wait: the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has optional parameters. We are not providing any, so it will use the defaults. That's acceptable.\n\n   Also note: the `clone_repo` function has optional parameters. We are only providing the required `repo_url`.\n\n   We assume the clone will be in the current directory and create a directory named \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n   Therefore, the above function calls should be correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"at each turn\" we should try to complete the tasks. We are outputting all the function calls in one go. But the system might execute them one by one. And if one fails, the subsequent ones might fail. But we are to do our best.\n\n   Let's output the XML."}

Find relevant classes that might be related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories.\n   - We can use the function `get_relevant_classes` for this. We'll set `search_string` to 'CellResult', and since we want to include subdirectories, we set `include_subdirectories` to true.\n   - We don't have a requirement for case sensitivity, so we can leave `case_sensitive` as default (false) or set it to false.\n\n2. Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n   - We can use the function `get_signature` for each method. We know the class name is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'.\n   - Since these might be public methods, we don't need to include private ones, so we can set `include_private` to false or omit it (as it's optional).\n\nHowever, note that the `get_signature` function requires the class name and method name. We are not sure about the module, but the function doesn't require a module name. We are also not given the module for `AbstractCellHandler`, so we'll proceed without it.\n\nBut wait, the function `get_signature` does not have a parameter for module. How do we specify the module? Looking at the function definitions, only `get_class_info` has an optional `module_name`. For `get_signature`, we don't have a module parameter. So we assume it can work without the module, or the system knows the context.\n\nGiven that, we can break down the calls:\n\nFirst, for the relevant classes search:\n   - Function: `get_relevant_classes`\n   - Parameters: \n        search_string: \"CellResult\"\n        include_subdirectories: true\n\nSecond, for the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler':\n   - We need two separate calls to `get_signature`? Actually, we can only call one method at a time. So we have to make two calls.\n\nBut note: the function `get_signature` returns the signature of one method. So we'll make one call for 'setCellValue' and one for 'getCellValue'.\n\nAlternatively, we could use `get_class_info` to get all methods of the class and then extract the two we need? However, the user specifically asks for the signatures of these two methods, and we don't want to overload with unnecessary info. Also, the `get_class_info` returns a lot of information and we don't know if it includes method signatures in the same detail as `get_signature`. The description of `get_class_info` says it retrieves information about methods, but the `get_signature` is specifically for the signature including parameter names and types. So it's better to use `get_signature` for each method.\n\nSo we will make three function calls in total.\n\nLet's structure the TOOLCALL:\n\nFirst call: get_relevant_classes for \"CellResult\"\nSecond call: get_signature for method \"setCellValue\" in class \"AbstractCellHandler\"\nThird call: get_signature for method \"getCellValue\" in class \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n\nBut note: the user also mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler'. So we are focusing on the superclass for the methods.\n\nWe'll set `include_private` to false for the `get_signature` calls because the methods we are interested in are public (they are being overridden).\n\nNow, note that the `get_signature` function has an optional parameter `include_private`. We can set it to false explicitly to avoid including private methods, but since it's optional and we want only public, we set it.\n\nHowever, the problem says: if the given question lacks parameters, point it out. We have all required parameters for each function.\n\nSo we write the TOOLCALL block accordingly."}
