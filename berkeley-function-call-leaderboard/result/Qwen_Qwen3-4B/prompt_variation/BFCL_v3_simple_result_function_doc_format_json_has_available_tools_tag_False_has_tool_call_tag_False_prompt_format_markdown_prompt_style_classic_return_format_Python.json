Status has a default of 'ongoing', so if the user specifies 'ongoing', we can include it, but since the default is already ongoing, maybe it's not necessary.

Wait, the function's start_date parameter is the start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed. The user says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 1, 2021, but since it's after, maybe the start_date is January 1, 2021, and the end date isn't specified. Wait, the function only takes start_date and location, but the user's query is about lawsuits filed after a certain date. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date. So maybe the function is designed to take a start_date, and perhaps the end_date is not required. But the user's query is \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the function will return lawsuits filed from that date onwards. But the function's description says \"start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So if the user wants after January 1, 2021, perhaps the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the function will include all lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user says \"after\", which might mean strictly after. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so maybe the function is designed to take a start_date and return all lawsuits filed on or after that date.

So status is optional. But the user is asking for ongoing lawsuits, so including status='ongoing' is correct. So the function call should include all four parameters. But since status is optional, maybe it's not necessary, but to be precise, including it is better.\n\nSo the function call would be lawsuit_search(company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', status='ongoing')."}

Let me check the available functions. There's find_recipe which takes recipeName and maxCalories. The required parameter is recipeName, and maxCalories has a default of 1000. The user specified less than 500, so I need to set maxCalories to 500. The parameters are there, so I can call the function with recipeName \"pasta carbonara\" and maxCalories 500."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York, for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function requires location, room_type, duration, start_date, and optional preferences. The location here is Manhattan, New York. The room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The preferences include pet_friendly. The user mentioned \"near Manhattan,\" but the function's location parameter is a string, so maybe \"Manhattan, New York\" is sufficient. The preferences array should include pet_friendly. The other parameters like gym, swimming_pool, etc., are optional and not specified, so we can leave them out. Wait, the preferences default to all if not specified, but the user only wants pet_friendly. So I should specify preferences as ['pet_friendly'] to ensure that's the only preference. Let me make sure all required parameters are there: location, room_type, duration, start_date. Yes. So the function call should include those, plus preferences."}
