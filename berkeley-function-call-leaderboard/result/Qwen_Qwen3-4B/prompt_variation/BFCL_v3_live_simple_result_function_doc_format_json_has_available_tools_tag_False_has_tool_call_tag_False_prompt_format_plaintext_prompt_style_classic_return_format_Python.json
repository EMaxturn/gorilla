So loc would be \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\".\n\nThe type is specified as 'Plus', which is in the enum ['plus', 'comfort', 'black'].

The address is correctly formatted, even though it includes the ZIP. The function's example doesn't have a ZIP, but the user's input includes it. Maybe the function can accept that.

The function available is get_movies, which requires the city parameter. The user specified Mumbai as the city, so that's covered. The date is mentioned as \"today,\" so I need to set the movie_date to today's date in India. Since the function's default for movie_date is the current date, but the user is asking for today, I should explicitly set it to today's date. Wait, the function's default is already the current date, so maybe I don't need to include it. But the user is asking for today, so maybe it's better to include it to be explicit. However, the function's default is set to None, and the default value in the parameters is the current date. Wait, looking back at the parameters: the movie_date has a default of None, but the description says the default is the current date. Wait, no, the parameters say for movie_date, the default is None, but the description says \"Default is the current date.\" That might be a discrepancy. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says the default is the current date. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to use the current date if not provided. But the user is asking for today, so maybe it's safe to include the date parameter. However, since the user is asking for today, and the function's default is the current date, perhaps we can omit it. But to be precise, maybe include it. Wait, the function's parameters have movie_date with a default of None, but the description says the default is the current date. That's conflicting. Wait, looking at the parameters again: the movie_date's default is None, but the description says \"Default is the current date.\" That might be an error in the description. But according to the parameters, the default is None. So if the user is asking for today, we need to set the movie_date to today's date. So I need to calculate today's date in India. Since the user is in India, the current date would be today's date. So I should set movie_date to today's date. But how to format it? The function requires the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. So I need to get today's date in that format. But since the function's default is the current date, maybe the user's question is already covered by the default. However, the user is explicitly asking for today, so maybe it's better to include it. But the parameters say the default is None, so maybe the function will use the current date if not provided. Wait, the description says \"Default is the current date.\" So perhaps the function will automatically use today's date if not provided. Therefore, in this case, the user's question can be answered by calling get_movies with city='Mumbai' and not specifying movie_date, as the default will be today. However, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, which might mean that the function will not use the current date unless specified. This is a bit confusing. Let me check again. The parameters for movie_date: 'default': None. But the description says \"Default is the current date.\" That's conflicting. Maybe the description is wrong. But according to the parameters, the default is None. Therefore, if the user is asking for today, we need to set movie_date to today's date. So I need to calculate today's date in India. Let's assume today's date is 2023-10-05 (for example). So the function call would be get_movies(city='Mumbai', movie_date='2023-10-05'). But since the user is asking for today, and the function's default is the current date, maybe it's better to include it. However, the parameters say the default is None, so the function might not use the current date unless provided. Therefore, to ensure that the date is set to today, we need to include it. So the correct function call would be get_movies(city='Mumbai', movie_date='YYYY-MM-DD'), where YYYY-MM-DD is today's date. But since the user is in India, the date is based on India's time zone. So the assistant should calculate today's date in India. But since the assistant is to be in the current turn, perhaps the date is set to today's date. Therefore, the function call would be get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date. However, the parameters for the function have movie_date's default as None, but the description says the default is the current date. This is conflicting. But according to the parameters, the default is None, so the function will not use the current date unless provided. Therefore, the user's question requires specifying the date. So the correct function call is get_movies(city='Mumbai', movie_date='YYYY-MM-DD'), where YYYY-MM-DD is today's date. Therefore, the assistant should generate that function call."}

But the user didn't mention district or sub-district, so maybe those parameters aren't needed. \n\nThe rating is 4.5, so the rating parameter should be 4.5. The availability dates: the user specified 12/03/2024 16:00 to 18:00. The function parameters start_available_date and end_available_date need to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format. So converting 12/03/2024 to 2024-03-12, and 16:00 to 18:00. So start_available_date would be '2024-03-12 16:00:00' and end_available_date '2024-03-12 18:00:00'.\n\nWait, the default for start_available_date is the current date and time, but the user specified a particular date. So I need to set both start and end dates. The end date is 18:00, so that's the end time. \n\nPutting it all together: service_id=2, province_id=3, rating=4.5, start_available_date='2024-03-12 16:00:00', end_available_date='2024-03-12 18:00:00'. The other parameters like district and sub-district are not provided, so they can be omitted or set to default (None). \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The function call should include these parameters. Let me double-check the required parameters. The service_id is required, which is 2. The others are optional. So the function call should be get_service_providers with those parameters."}

The function provided is getDataForProfessional. The parameters required are service_id, province_id, and others like district_name, sub_district_name, rating, etc.\n\nThe service type is ironing, which according to the enum in the function is service_id 2. Province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district is Sankampang, and the sub-district is Ton Pao. The rating needed is 4.5. \n\nSo I need to map these details into the function parameters. The required parameters are service_id and province_id, which are 2 and 2 respectively. Then, district_name is Sankampang, sub_district_name is Ton Pao, and rating is 4.5. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't specified, so they can be left as default. Also, has_late_check_in is optional and defaults to False, which is acceptable unless the user specifies otherwise. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention availability dates, so those can be omitted.

The function's parameters are in a dictionary, so the call should be structured accordingly. The user didn't mention anything about availability, so those parameters can be left out. The function should retrieve the professionals based on these criteria."}
