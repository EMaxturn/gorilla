The other parameters like cinema_hall, movie_date, movie_language, and movie_format are optional.\n\nThe user specified \"today,\" so I need to set the movie_date to the current date in India. The system should default the movie_date to today's date if not provided. Since the user didn't mention a specific date, I can rely on the default.

The user might need the service ID to proceed, but the question is to find the housekeeper, which might require the service ID. However, the function's description says it retrieves the unique identifier for a specific service.

The user wants to find a housekeeper who provides ironing services in Chonburi Province. They also want a review score of 4.5 stars or more and availability from 12/03/2024 16:00 to 18:00.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The get_service_providers function seems relevant. Let me look at its parameters. The service_id is required, and the example says 2 for ironing. So service_id=2. \n\nThen, the province_id is 3 for Chonburi. The district_name and sub_district_name are optional, but the user mentioned Chonburi Province, so maybe those can be omitted. The rating parameter needs to be 4.5, so rating=4.5. \n\nThe start_available_date is 12/03/2024 16:00, and end_available_date is 18:00.
