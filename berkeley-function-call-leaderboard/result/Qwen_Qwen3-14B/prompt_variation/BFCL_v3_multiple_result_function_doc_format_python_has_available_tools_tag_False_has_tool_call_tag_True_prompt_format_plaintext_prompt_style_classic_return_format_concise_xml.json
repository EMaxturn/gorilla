The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight line motion, so the kinematics functions should apply.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters: initial_speed (int), acceleration (int), time (int), and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. All are integers, so that fits. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2. The user didn't specify rounding, so I can omit it or set to 2.\n\nSo the correct function call is calculate_displacement with those values. I don't need to use calculate_final_speed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. All parameters are present, so no missing info. Just need to make sure the types are correct. The function expects integers, and the inputs are integers. So the tool call should be correct."}

The region has a default, but the user specified it, so I should include that. I'll call store_price with these parameters to get the price. Since the question is about the cheapest price, maybe there's a sale, but the function store_price should return the current selling price, which might already account for any ongoing sales. Alternatively, maybe I should check if it's on sale using the on_sale function, but the user specifically asked for the price. So the main function needed is store_price.

They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions. There's calculate_acceleration which takes initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But we don't know the acceleration or the final speed here. Wait, but the user is asking for the final speed. \n\nAnother function is calculate_speed_from_rest, which takes distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). That sounds relevant because the object starts from rest. Let me check the parameters. The function requires distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds. Since initial speed is 0, maybe this function can calculate the final speed directly.\n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. So if we use this function with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0, it should return the final speed. That seems right. So the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}
