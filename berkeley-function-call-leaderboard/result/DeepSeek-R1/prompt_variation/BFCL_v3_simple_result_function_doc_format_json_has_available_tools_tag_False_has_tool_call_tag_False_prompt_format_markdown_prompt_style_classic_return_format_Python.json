The problem says: \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax.\"\n\n So we can use: ['highways','tolls'] as the value for avoid.\n\n However, the tool call format must be strictly followed. We are to output only the function call in the exact format.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n   [map_service.get_directions(start=\"New York\", end=\"Los Angeles\", avoid=['highways','tolls'])]\n\n But note: the function name is exactly as given: 'map_service.get_directions'\n\n However, in the function call format, we write the function name without quotes? Actually, the example does not use quotes for the function name. It is written as: func_name1(...)\n\n So we write without quotes.\n\n Also, the parameters are passed as keyword arguments.\n\n Important: The function call must be in a list? Because the format says: [func_name1(...), func_name2(...)] meaning it's a list of function calls. Even if there's one, we put it in a list.\n\n Therefore, the response is:\n   [map_service.get_directions(start=\"New York\", end=\"Los Angeles\", avoid=['highways','tolls'])]"}

Since the function expects a title, we can try with the common name, but it might not be found. Alternatively, we can try with the well-known title.\n\n However, the function does not have a way to handle common names vs. exact titles. We must provide the exact title as per the function's requirement? But note the function description does not specify that it must be the exact title. It says \"Title of the scientific work\". So we can try with the common name.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the exact title that is widely known: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" or just \"Principia\".\n\n Since the question asks for the law of universal gravitation, and that law was published in the \"Principia\", we can use:\n\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n However, note that the function might not have that exact string. Alternatively, we can try the common abbreviation: \"Principia\".\n\n But without knowing the exact title in the database, we have to make an educated guess. Also, the function does not have a way to search by concept.\n\n Given the constraints, we'll try with the most famous title by Newton that contains the law: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\".\n\n Alternatively, we can also note that the law of universal gravitation was first presented in that book, so we can use that book's title.\n\n We'll call the function with:\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n But note: the function may require the exact title as stored. We don't have a way to know the exact stored string. We hope that the function can handle variations or that the database has the full title.\n\n Alternatively, we can try with the common English translation: \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\". However, the original was in Latin.\n\n Since we are not sure, we might have to try multiple times? But note: the problem says we can make one or more function calls. We can try with the Latin title first, and if that fails, we can try with the English.\n\n However, the current function call does not allow for multiple titles in one call. So we have to make one call at a time.\n\n But the problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n So we can try:\n\n Step 1: Call with the Latin title.\n Step 2: If the first call returns nothing (which we cannot know until we get the result, but in the next turn we will get the result and then we can decide), then we try with the English title.\n\n However, the instruction says: at each turn, we output the function calls for that turn. And then the system will run them and return the results. Then in the next turn, we can use the results and decide what to do next.\n\n But note: the current turn is one turn. We are only allowed to output one set of function calls per turn? The problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n However, the format says we return a list of function calls. So we can return multiple function calls in one turn? The example format: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\n But note: the function call format does not specify that we can only call one function. We can call multiple in one turn.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have the parameters.\n\n But we are not sure which title is stored. We can try both in one turn? However, the function does not allow multiple titles in one call. So we have to make two separate calls.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   [publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'),\n    publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy')]\n\n But note: the function call format does not allow two calls to the same function with different parameters? Actually, it does. We are just calling the function twice with different parameters.\n\n However, the system might run both and return two results. Then we can use the first one that returns a non-null result.\n\n Alternatively, we might get two results and then we have to choose? But the question is about the same work. So if one returns 1687 and the other returns 1687 (or the same year) then we can use that.\n\n But note: the function might return an error if the work is not found? We don't know. The description doesn't say.\n\n Alternatively, we can try with the common name \"Principia\" because it is the most well-known abbreviation.\n\n However, to be safe, we try the two most likely titles.\n\n But note: the function also has an optional parameter 'location'. We don't have that, so we skip it (it defaults to 'all').\n\n Therefore, we make two function calls in one turn.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But we are using the function. We have the required parameters.\n\n But note: the problem says we must output the function calls in the format and nothing else. So we output:\n\n   [publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy')]\n\n Alternatively, we can also try with the abbreviation:\n\n   publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Principia')\n\n But let's try the two full titles first.\n\n However, to avoid too many calls, we can try one call with the most common title: the Latin one. But the problem doesn't specify how many calls we can make.\n\n Considering that the system will run the calls and we might get an answer from one of them, we can do two.\n\n But note: the problem says we can make one or more function calls. So two is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can try the abbreviation in a third call? But let's stick to two for now.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the law of universal gravitation is in the \"Principia\", so we can also try:\n\n   work_title: \"Principia\"\n\n We'll do three calls? But that might be overkill. We don't know the exact database.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the database. We are to use the function as provided.\n\n Since we are allowed to call multiple times, we can do:\n\n   call1: work_title='Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'\n   call2: work_title='Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'\n   call3: work_title='Principia'\n\n But note: the problem says to fulfill the request to the best of our ability.

We are using the correct parameter names: 'author' and 'work_title'. We are not including the optional 'location'.\n\n We are using the exact string for the author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n\n So the final answer for this turn is:\n\n   [publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Principia')]\n\n However, note: the function call in the format must be in a list and each function call must be in the format of the function name and then the parameters in parentheses.\n\n But note: the example format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\n\n We have to write the parameters as key=value pairs.\n\n Also, note that the work_title strings might have special characters. We are using the exact string with the Latin characters.\n\n But the system expects a string. We are writing it in single quotes.\n\n However, in the format, we can use single quotes. The example uses single quotes? Actually, the example does not specify, but in Python we can use single or double. The function call format is inspired by Python.\n\n We'll use single quotes for the string values.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   [publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Principia')]\n\n But note: the function name is in single quotes? No, the function name is not in quotes. Only the string parameters are.\n\n The example: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\n So we write the function name without quotes.\n\n Let me write it without any extra text.\n\n Important: The response must be only the function calls in the specified format and nothing else.\n\n So we write:\n\n[publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'), publication_year.find(author='Isaac Newton', work_title='Principia')]"}
