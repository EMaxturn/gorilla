ChaFod: for changing food items. Parameters: \n        - foodItem (required): string\n        - removeIngredients: string (comma-separated list, default empty)\n        - newIngredients: string (comma-separated list, default empty)\n        - specialInstructions: string (default empty)\n\n   2. ChaDri.change_drink: for changing drinks. Parameters:\n        - drink_id (required): string\n        - new_preferences (required): a dictionary with properties:\n            size: string (enum: small, medium, large; default medium)\n            temperature: string (enum: cold, warm, hot; default cold)\n            sweetness_level: string (enum: none, light, regular, extra; default regular)\n            milk_type: string (enum: regular, soy, almond, coconut; default regular)\n            special_instructions: string (default empty)\n\n We can break the request into two function calls.\n\n For the food change:\n   ChaFod(\n        foodItem=\"Caesar salad\",\n        removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"\n   )\n\n For the drink change:\n   ChaDri.change_drink(\n        drink_id=\"123\",\n        new_preferences={\n            'size': 'large',\n            'temperature': 'hot',\n            'sweetness_level': 'regular',   # note: regular is the default, but we can specify to be clear\n            'milk_type': 'almond',\n            'special_instructions': ''      # not provided, so we can leave empty or omit? But the function expects a dict with these keys. Since the function has default for each, we can set to the desired value and omit the ones that are default? However, the function expects the entire `new_preferences` dictionary. We must provide all the keys? Actually, the function documentation says that each property in `new_preferences` has a default. But the function call requires the `new_preferences` dictionary. We can provide only the keys that are changing? However, the function expects a dictionary that may have any of the properties. But note: the required parameters for the function are `drink_id` and `new_preferences`. The `new_preferences` parameter is a dictionary that must be provided, and it can have any subset of the properties (with defaults for the ones not provided). However, the tool definition says the properties of `new_preferences` are optional? Actually, the `properties` under `new_preferences` are each optional because they have defaults.\n\n   But note: the tool definition for `ChaDri.change_drink` says the `new_preferences` is a dict with properties. It doesn't say that all properties are required. So we can provide a dictionary with only the keys that are being updated? However, the function expects the entire set of preferences? Actually, the description says \"the updated preferences\", meaning we are replacing the entire preferences with the provided ones? Or is it a partial update? The description does not specify.\n\n   Let's look at the function description: \"Modifies the existing drink order to accommodate the customer's new request, ensuring the drink is updated according to the specified preferences.\" It says \"specified preferences\", which implies that we are only updating the fields that are provided? But the function parameters require a `new_preferences` dictionary. Without knowing the implementation, we have to rely on the interface.\n\n   The function does not require every property of `new_preferences` to be present because they have defaults. So we can provide a dictionary with only the keys we wish to change. However, note that the function might interpret missing keys as \"keep the current value\" or \"reset to default\"? The tool definition doesn't specify.\n\n   But the problem says: \"the updated preferences for the drink order\". And the properties have defaults. So if we don't provide a key, it will use the default? That might not be what we want because we don't want to reset other preferences to default. We only want to change the ones mentioned.\n\n   However, the user is providing a complete set of changes for the drink: they are specifying size, temperature, sweetness_level, and milk_type. They are not mentioning special_instructions, so we can leave that as the existing one? But the function doesn't allow partial updates? \n\n   Since the tool definition doesn't specify, and we are told that the function is in Python 3 syntax, we must assume that the function expects a dictionary that may have any of the properties. The function will update only the provided properties? Or it will replace the entire preferences? \n\n   Given the ambiguity, we should provide all the properties that we know and set the ones that are not changing to their current value? But we don't have the current value. Alternatively, we can note that the function might be designed to do a merge? \n\n   However, the user's request is very clear: they want to update to a \"large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk\". This implies that we are setting:\n        size: large\n        temperature: hot\n        sweetness_level: regular\n        milk_type: almond\n\n   And we are leaving the special_instructions as they were? But the function doesn't let us specify that we don't want to change special_instructions. We have to provide a value for special_instructions? The function has a default of empty string. If we set it to empty string, it might clear any existing special instructions. That might not be what the user wants.\n\n   The user did not mention any change to special_instructions, so we don't want to alter them. But the function doesn't have a way to indicate \"no change\" for a field. Therefore, we must assume that the function is designed to only update the fields that are provided? Or that the function requires the entire set of preferences? \n\n   Looking at the tool definition again: the `new_preferences` parameter is described as \"The updated preferences for the drink order.\" and it is a dictionary. The properties are optional because they have defaults. This suggests that we can omit any property that we don't want to change? But the function implementation might not work that way.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify, and we are constrained by the tool definition, we have to make a decision. The tool definition says that each property in `new_preferences` has a default. This implies that if we omit a property, the function will use the default. But that would reset any existing value for that property to the default, which we don't want.\n\n   Therefore, we must have all the current preferences? We don't have them. So we cannot use the function without knowing the current state? That is not practical.\n\n   Alternatively, the function might be designed to do a partial update: only update the fields that are provided and leave the rest unchanged. That is a common design. But the tool definition does not say so.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we must rely on the fact that the function is provided and we have to use it. Since the user is specifying only these fields, we can set them and hope that the function leaves the other fields (like special_instructions) unchanged? But the tool doesn't say that.\n\n   However, note that the function description says: \"modifies the existing drink order to accommodate the customer's new request\". This implies that it is updating the order with the new request, meaning only the fields that are specified in the request. So we can provide only the fields that the customer specified? But the function expects a dictionary of preferences. How do we represent that?\n\n   We can provide the dictionary with only the fields that the customer mentioned? But the tool definition does not say that the function supports partial updates. It requires the `new_preferences` dictionary, but the properties are optional. So we can provide:\n\n        new_preferences = {\n            'size': 'large',\n            'temperature': 'hot',\n            'sweetness_level': 'regular',\n            'milk_type': 'almond'\n        }\n\n   and omit 'special_instructions'. Then the function would leave the existing special instructions unchanged? Or set it to default? We don't know.\n\n   Since the problem states: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" and we don't have the current special_instructions, we cannot provide it. But the function doesn't require the special_instructions because it has a default. So we can leave it out? \n\n   However, the function might require that we pass all the keys? The tool definition does not say that the properties are required in the dictionary. It says the `new_preferences` is required and is a dict, and the properties of that dict are optional (because they have defaults). So we can pass a dictionary with only the keys we have.\n\n   Let's do that and hope that the function implementation only updates the provided fields. Alternatively, we can set the special_instructions to an empty string? But that would clear any existing special instructions, which the customer did not request.\n\n   Since the customer did not request a change to special instructions, we should not clear them. Therefore, we must not pass the 'special_instructions' key? \n\n   But without knowing the function's behavior, we have to assume that the function is designed to do a partial update? Otherwise, the function would be unusable without the entire state.\n\n   Given the context, we will pass only the keys that the customer specified.\n\n   Therefore, for the drink change:\n\n        ChaDri.change_drink(\n            drink_id=\"123\",\n            new_preferences={\n                'size': 'large',\n                'temperature': 'hot',\n                'sweetness_level': 'regular',\n                'milk_type': 'almond'\n            }\n        )\n\n   But note: the function expects the `new_preferences` to be a dictionary that may contain any of the properties. We are providing four of the five properties (omitting special_instructions). This should be acceptable.\n\n   However, the tool definition says that the `new_preferences` parameter is required and is a dictionary. It does not require every key in the dictionary to be present.\n\n   Therefore, we will make two function calls.\n\n   Format: We must output the function calls in the specified format.\n\n   Let's write:\n\n        [ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={'size':'large','temperature':'hot','sweetness_level':'regular','milk_type':'almond'})]\n\n   However, note that the function names are exactly as given: \"ChaFod\" and \"ChaDri.change_drink\". We must use the exact name.\n\n   Also, the parameters must be passed as named parameters.\n\n   We are using double quotes for string values. But note: the function call format in the example uses double quotes for the function name and parameters? Actually, the example says: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\n   The values can be in double quotes or single quotes? The example doesn't specify. But in Python, both are acceptable. We'll use double for the outer and single for the inner? Or we can use double for everything? However, in the inner dictionary for the drink, we have keys that are strings. We can use single quotes for the keys to avoid escaping? Or we can use double for the outer and double for the inner by escaping? That would be messy.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write the entire thing in a way that is valid in the context. The problem says \"in the format of [func_name1(...), ...]\". We are free to use any valid representation? But note: the example uses double quotes for the parameter values? Actually, the example does not show a dictionary.\n\n   We are representing the dictionary as a Python dict. We can use:\n\n        new_preferences={\"size\":\"large\",\"temperature\":\"hot\",\"sweetness_level\":\"regular\",\"milk_type\":\"almond\"}\n\n   But note: the function call is being passed as a string. We have to write it in a way that is parseable.\n\n   Since the problem says the function is in Python 3 syntax, we can use Python's syntax for the dictionary.\n\n   We'll write the function calls in a single line without extra spaces? But the example doesn't specify spacing.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        [ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\":\"large\",\"temperature\":\"hot\",\"sweetness_level\":\"regular\",\"milk_type\":\"almond\"})]\n\n   But note: the tool definition for the drink function has an enum for milk_type that includes 'almond', which we are using.\n\n   Also, the drink function has an enum for temperature: 'hot' is allowed.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, note that the food function has a parameter `newIngredients` that we are not providing. We can skip it because it has a default of empty string. Similarly, `specialInstructions` is not provided and will default to empty.\n\n   So we are only providing the required `foodItem` and the `removeIngredients`.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n        [ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\":\"large\",\"temperature\":\"hot\",\"sweetness_level\":\"regular\",\"milk_type\":\"almond\"})]\n\n   But note: in the food function, the parameter `removeIngredients` is a comma-separated list. We are passing a single string \"anchovies\". That is acceptable because it is a comma-separated list of one item.\n\n   We are not including any other text.\n\n   Let's output exactly that."}

However, the user did specify, so we include it.\n\n Alternatively, we could call without the unit and it would use metric.

But the function does not accept a list of skills. The parameter 'skill' is a string.\n\n Therefore, we should make two separate calls.\n\n Also, note that the function has optional parameters: experience_level and availability. The user didn't specify, so we can use the defaults.\n\n So, we can call:\n   get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\")\n   get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")\n\n But note: the function expects a dictionary. We are to represent the call in the format: [func_name(param1=value1, ...)]\n\n We are to output two function calls?

We are not required to pass the optional ones if we are okay with defaults.\n\n However, the function signature includes 'experience_level' and 'availability'. Since the user did not specify, we can rely on the defaults.\n\n Alternatively, we can explicitly set them to the default? But the instructions say we can omit optional parameters.\n\n But wait: the function call format in the example does not require including every parameter? The function has defaults.\n\n So, we can just pass the required parameter and the optional ones will be taken care of by the function.\n\n However, note that the function requires the parameter 'skill'. We are passing that.\n\n But what about the other optional parameters? We are not required to set them because they have defaults.\n\n Therefore, we can simply call the function for each skill without the optional parameters.\n\n But note: the function call must be in the exact format as described. We are to pass the parameters by name.\n\n Also, note that the function names are exactly as given: 'get_interviewer_list' and 'review_of_interviewer'.\n\n Let's write the two calls.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\n So we output:\n   [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n But wait: the user might want the same experience level and availability for both? Since they didn't specify, we use the defaults for both.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the user wants interviewers who are available (since the default for availability is True) and at the default experience level (Mid-Level). So we are safe.\n\n However, what if the user wants to see both skills in one list? The function returns a list for one skill. We are making two separate calls.\n\n The system will run both and then we can combine the results? But that's beyond the function call.\n\n We are only to output the function calls. The system will run them and then we can process the results in the next step? But the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n At this turn, we are making the two calls. Then the system will return the results of these two calls. Then we can process (maybe in the next turn) by combining the two lists? But the user hasn't asked for any processing. They just asked for the list.\n\n However, note that the user asked for \"interviewers list for Python and Java\". We are getting two lists: one for Python and one for Java.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to get a list of interviewers who have both skills? But the function doesn't support multiple skills. So we cannot do that in one call.\n\n Therefore, we do two calls.\n\n But note: the function returns a list of interviewers for one skill. We don't know if an interviewer has both skills until we get both lists? And then we can intersect? But the user didn't specify if they want interviewers with both skills or either.\n\n The question says \"for Python and Java\", which could be ambiguous. But in the context, it's likely they want interviewers for either skill? Or maybe both? The user didn't specify.\n\n Since the function doesn't support multiple skills, we have to get two separate lists. Then we can combine (union) for either, or intersect for both? But the user didn't specify.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we should get the two lists and then let the user decide? Or we can get both and then in the next step, if we have the data, we can do the processing? However, the current turn is only to output the function calls.\n\n We are not allowed to do processing in the function call step? We are only to output the calls.\n\n So we do:\n\n   [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n Then, in the next turn, we can get the results and then we can combine them? But the system will run the functions and return the results, and then we can use the results to answer the user.\n\n Alternatively, if we want to get interviewers who have both skills, we would have to get the two lists and then find the common names? But that would be in a subsequent step? However, the current instruction is to make the function calls.\n\n So for now, we output the two calls.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"at each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks\". We are making two calls to get the two lists. That is the best we can do with the given functions.\n\n Let's output the two function calls.\n\n Important: the function name must be exactly as given: 'get_interviewer_list'\n\n Also, the parameters are passed by name and the values are strings, so we use double quotes.\n\n We are to output: [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n But note: there is a typo in the function name in the example I wrote above? Let me check: the function is named 'get_interviewer_list'. So we must write it correctly.\n\n Correction: I wrote 'get_interviewer_list' correctly in the first call but in the second call I wrote 'get_interviewer_list'? Actually, in the example above I wrote \"get_interviewer_list\" for the first and then \"get_interviewer_list\" for the second? That was a typo in my thought. The correct function name is 'get_interviewer_list'.\n\n So the output should be:\n\n   [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n But wait, I made a typo again? Let me write it correctly:\n\n   [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n Actually, the function name is 'get_interviewer_list'? Wait, no! The function is named 'get_interviewer_list'. Let me check the available tools:\n\n   [{'name': 'get_interviewer_list', ...}]\n\n So the name is 'get_interviewer_list'. I see I've been inconsistent. Let me correct:\n\n   [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n That's correct.\n\n However, note: the function call format does not require the function name to be in quotes? In the example, it's without quotes.\n\n We write: [func_name(param=value, ...)]\n\n So without quotes around the function name.\n\n Therefore, the output is:\n\n   [get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Python\"), get_interviewer_list(skill=\"Java\")]\n\n But note: the system might run these two calls and then we can process the results in the next step? The user's request is for a list, and we are getting two lists. We don't have a function to combine them? So we might have to do that in the response to the user? But that's beyond the function call.\n\n We are only to output the function calls. The system will run them and then we will see the results? Then we can decide what to do next? But the instruction says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete\".\n\n So we output the two calls and then the turn is complete.\n\n Let's do that."}

We must break it down and call the appropriate functions in sequence.\n\n Step 1: Clone the repository.\n   - Function: clone_repo\n   - Parameters: \n        repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n        destination: We are not specified, so use default (current directory). But note: the next steps require knowing the directory name.\n        However, the repo URL ends with 'nodejs-welcome.git', so the directory created will be 'nodejs-welcome' (by default).\n\n Step 2: Analyse the contents of the repo and then create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - First, we need to analyse the repo to know the language? But note: the function 'analyse_repo_contents' returns the predominant programming language.\n   - However, the task says to create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. But our available functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not require the language as input? \n   - Actually, the function 'create_a_docker_file' only takes the directory name. It is assumed that the function will look at the contents of the directory to create an appropriate Dockerfile.\n   - Similarly, the function 'create_kubernetes_yaml_file' takes the directory name and other optional parameters.\n\n   So, step 2.1: create_a_docker_file in the directory of the cloned repo.\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'   (the directory that was cloned)\n\n   Step 2.2: create_kubernetes_yaml_file in the same directory.\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n   However, note: the task says \"based on the analysis\". We are not using the analysis function? Let me reexamine.\n\n   The task says: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we must call the analysis function? But note that the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not take the language as input. They are designed to work based on the directory contents? \n\n   But the available function 'create_a_docker_file' does not mention using analysis. It just says \"Generates a Dockerfile\". Similarly for Kubernetes.\n\n   However, the function 'analyse_repo_contents' returns the language, but we don't have a function that uses that language to create the Dockerfile. So perhaps we don't need the analysis function? Or maybe the analysis function is used internally by the Dockerfile creation? \n\n   The task says: \"2.1 create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". So we must do the analysis? But the available functions don't show that the Dockerfile creation function uses the analysis. \n\n   Since we are required to do the analysis, we should call it. But note: the analysis function only returns the language. We don't have a function that creates a Dockerfile for a specific language. \n\n   Let's look at the available functions again: \n        - create_a_docker_file: only takes the directory name. It must be that this function does the analysis internally? \n\n   But the description says: \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory\". It doesn't say it does analysis. \n\n   However, the task requires analysis. We have an analysis function. So we must call it? But what do we do with the result? We don't have a function that takes the language and creates a Dockerfile. \n\n   Considering the instructions: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" and \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" \n\n   But note: the task is to do the steps using the provided functions. We have a function to create a Dockerfile and one to do analysis. The task says \"based on the analysis\", meaning we should do the analysis first and then use that result to create the Dockerfile? But our Dockerfile function doesn't take the language as a parameter. \n\n   This is a conflict. However, note that the function 'create_a_docker_file' might internally do the analysis? We don't know the implementation. Since we are only to use the provided functions, and we don't have a function that creates a Dockerfile that takes the language, we must assume that the Dockerfile creation function does the analysis itself? \n\n   Alternatively, the task might be broken down as:\n        - Step 2: Analyse the contents (we call analyse_repo_contents) and then use that information to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs? But how? We don't have a function that takes the language.\n\n   Since the available functions do not require the language for creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, we can skip calling the analysis function? But the task explicitly says \"analyse the contents\". \n\n   We must follow the task. So we should call the analysis function, but note that we don't have a function that uses the result. Therefore, we must point out that we cannot create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis because the available functions do not take the language as input? \n\n   However, let's reexamine the functions: \n        - The function 'create_a_docker_file' only requires the directory name. It doesn't require the language. So it must be that it does the analysis internally? \n\n   Given the ambiguity, and since the task requires the analysis, I think we should call the analysis function. Even if we don't use the result, we are fulfilling the step of analysis. Then we proceed to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. \n\n   Alternatively, the analysis step might be for our own knowledge? But the task says \"based on the analysis\", meaning the creation should use the result. \n\n   Since we are constrained by the available functions, we do:\n        Step 2: \n            a) analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n            b) Then, we call create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome') and create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   We are not passing the analysis result to the next functions because the functions don't take it. But we are doing the analysis step.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes? But note the function 'push_git_changes_to_github' does \"git add all changes\" automatically. So we don't need a separate step for adding.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push to the repo. We have the function 'push_git_changes_to_github'. It will do:\n        - git add all changes\n        - commit with a message (we can use the default or specify one? The task doesn't specify, so use default)\n        - push to the branch (default is 'main')\n\n   But note: the task says \"commit / push to repo\". We are not told the branch? We'll use the default.\n\n   However, note: the task says \"push to repo\", but the function pushes to the associated remote (which is already set because we cloned). \n\n   Also note: the function requires the directory name.\n\n   So we call: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   But wait: the task says \"add all changed file to git changes\" in step 3. The push function does that automatically? Yes, according to the description: \"automatically git add all changes\".\n\n   So we can skip step 3 as it is included in step 4.\n\n Plan:\n\n   We are going to make multiple function calls. We must output them in the format [func1, func2, ...].\n\n   However, note: the step 2 requires the analysis result? But we are not using it. We are calling the analysis function and then the creation functions. But the creation functions might rely on the directory contents and not the analysis result? \n\n   Alternatively, we might not need to call the analysis function at all? Because the Dockerfile creation function might do the analysis? \n\n   The task says: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we must call the analysis function? \n\n   Let's do:\n\n        Step 1: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n        Step 2: \n            a) analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n            b) create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n            c) create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        Step 4: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   But note: the step 2.2 says \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis\". We are not passing the analysis to the Kubernetes function? \n\n   Since we don't have a way to pass the analysis result, and the Kubernetes function doesn't require it, we proceed as above.\n\n   However, the task might be expecting that we use the analysis to set parameters for the Kubernetes function? For example, the port? But the task doesn't specify. \n\n   The Kubernetes function has parameters with defaults. We are not given any specific values, so we use the defaults.\n\n   Also note: the task says \"create/update dockerfile\". The function 'create_a_docker_file' will create a Dockerfile. If one exists, it might update? The description doesn't say. But we assume it will create or overwrite.\n\n   Similarly, the Kubernetes function will generate a YAML file? We don't know the name. But the task doesn't specify.\n\n   So we proceed.\n\n   But note: the clone_repo function returns the directory? We are assuming the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome'. \n\n   Alternatively, we can set the destination explicitly? The task doesn't specify, so we let it default.\n\n   We are going to call:\n\n        clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n        analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   However, note: the function 'create_kubernetes_yaml_file' has more parameters. We are using the defaults for all.\n\n   We are not given any specific values for deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. So we use the defaults.\n\n   Also note: the push function has parameters: commit_message (default: 'Update changes'), branch_name (default: 'main'), force_push (default: False). We use the defaults.\n\n   But wait: the task says \"commit / push to repo\". It doesn't specify the branch. We assume the branch we are on is the one we cloned (probably main) and we push to the same branch? \n\n   The push function uses branch_name='main' by default. If the cloned branch is not main, we might have a problem? But the task doesn't specify. We'll use the default.\n\n   Also note: the task says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3). The push function does that.\n\n   So the function calls are:\n\n        clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n        analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   However, note: the analysis function might not be necessary for the creation? But the task requires it. We are calling it.\n\n   But what if the analysis function returns a language that we don't support? The task doesn't specify. We are just following the steps.\n\n   We are ready to output the function calls.\n\n   Format: [func1(params), func2(params), ...]\n\n   We must use the exact parameter names and values.\n\n   Let's write:\n\n        [\n          clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'),\n          analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n          create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n          create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n          push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        ]\n\n   But note: the function 'create_kubernetes_yaml_file' has more parameters. We are using the defaults, so we don't have to specify them? \n\n   The function call format: we can omit parameters that have defaults and we are using the default? \n\n   However, the instruction says: \"params_name1=params_value1, ...\". We can pass only the required parameters and the ones we want to set? The rest will be default.\n\n   The required parameter for 'create_kubernetes_yaml_file' is 'directory_name'. The rest are optional and we are using the defaults. So we can just pass directory_name.\n\n   Similarly for the others.\n\n   But note: the clone_repo function: we are not specifying destination and recursive and depth? They have defaults. We use the defaults.\n\n   So we only pass repo_url.\n\n   However, the task says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We are providing the required parameters. The rest are optional and we are happy with the defaults.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above.\n\n   But note: the task says \"Do all the following using the steps provided in their respective sections.\" and we are doing all steps.\n\n   One more thing: the order matters. We must clone first, then analyse and create, then push.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the task says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3). We are doing that in the push function? The push function does \"git add all changes\". So step 3 is covered.\n\n   So we output the list of function calls as above.\n\n   Important: We must not output any other text.\n\n   Let me write the function calls in the required format.\n\n   But note: the function names must be exactly as provided.\n\n   The function names are:\n        clone_repo\n        analyse_repo_contents\n        create_a_docker_file\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n        push_git_changes_to_github\n\n   We are using the same.\n\n   The parameters are passed by keyword.\n\n   We write:\n\n        [clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]\n\n   But note: the push function has more parameters? We are using the defaults, so we don't need to specify.\n\n   We are done."}
{"id": "live_parallel_multiple_11-10-0", "result": "[get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]", "input_token_count": 1107, "output_token_count": 2011, "latency": 84.65241575241089, "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part question. The user is working on a Java project and has two main requests:\n 1. Find relevant classes that might be related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories.\n 2. Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\n For the first request, we can use the function 'get_relevant_classes' to search for classes related to 'CellResult'. Since the user wants to include subdirectories, we set 'include_subdirectories' to True.\n\n For the second request, we need to get the method signatures for two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can use the function 'get_signature'. However, note that the function 'get_signature' requires the class name and the method name. We are to get two methods: 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. We can make two separate calls or one call per method? The function is designed for one method at a time. So we need two calls.\n\n But note: the function 'get_signature' is defined to retrieve the signature of a specified method within a given class. Therefore, we must call it twice: once for 'setCellValue' and once for 'getCellValue'.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the user is working in Java, but the function descriptions mention Python 3 syntax. But the function 'get_signature' does not specify the language? Actually, the tool is designed to work on the repository regardless of language? The problem is that the tool's description does not explicitly state the language. But the user's project is in Java. We have to assume that the tools are language-agnostic? However, the function 'get_imports' has a parameter for language, but the others do not.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the tools are designed to work on the codebase, we assume they can handle Java as well.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Use get_relevant_classes to search for classes with the search string 'CellResult'. We set include_subdirectories to True.\n    Function call: get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True)\n\n 2. Use get_signature for the class 'AbstractCellHandler' and method 'setCellValue'.\n    Function call: get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\")\n\n 3. Use get_signature for the class 'AbstractCellHandler' and method 'getCellValue'.\n    Function call: get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")\n\n However, note that the function 'get_signature' has an optional parameter 'include_private'. We don't know if these methods are private? But the user is overriding them, so they are likely public. We can leave it to default (False) for now.\n\n But wait: the user might be in a Java project and the method names in Java are case-sensitive. The user provided the names as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. We must use the exact case.\n\n Also, note that the user is extending 'AbstractCellHandler' and overriding methods. So the methods must be at least protected or public.\n\n We'll make the three function calls.\n\n However, the tool call format requires that we output the function calls in the specified format. We can output multiple function calls in one response by separating them with commas.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]\"\n\n So we can write:\n\n [get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]\n\n However, note: in the parameters of get_relevant_classes, the parameter name is 'include_subdirectories' (with an 'i' at the end) not 'include_subdirectories' (typo in my previous thought). The function definition says: 'include_subdirectories'. So we must use the correct spelling.\n\n Correction: the function definition has 'include_subdirectories'? Let me check:\n\n The function definition for get_relevant_classes:\n   'include_subdirectories': {'type': 'boolean', ...}\n\n Actually, the function definition says: 'include_subdirectories'? Wait, in the provided JSON:\n\n   {'name': 'get_relevant_classes', ... 'properties': {'search_string': ..., 'case_sensitive': ..., 'include_subdirectories': ...}}\n\n So it is spelled 'include_subdirectories' (without the 'e' after 'director'? It says: 'include_subdirectories' -> that is, without the 'e'? Actually, it's written as 'include_subdirectories' in the JSON? Let me copy:\n\n   \"include_subdirectories\": {'type': 'boolean', 'description': 'Indicates whether to include subdirectories in the search. Defaults to false to search only at the root level.', 'default': False}\n\n But in the description it says \"subdirectories\" which might be a typo? Actually, the correct spelling is \"subdirectories\". But the parameter name is given as 'include_subdirectories'. So we use that.\n\n Therefore, we set: include_subdirectories=True (note: the parameter name is as given in the function definition).\n\n Also, note: the function get_relevant_classes does not require a module name? Because it's searching the repository.\n\n So the plan:\n\n [get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]\n\n But wait: the user also mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler'. So the class 'AbstractCellHandler' is in the same project? We assume the tools can find it.\n\n However, note: the function get_signature does not have a module_name parameter? It only has class_name and method_name. So it must be that the tool will search the entire project? Or is it limited to a module? The function get_signature does not have a module_name parameter. So we assume that the tool can find the class by name in the project.\n\n Alternatively, the function get_class_info has an optional module_name. But we are not using get_class_info.\n\n Given the above, we output the three function calls.\n\n But note: the user also has a problem with 'getNumericValue' not found in 'CellResult'. We are only searching for classes related to 'CellResult' to help the user find the correct class that has the method. We are not directly solving the missing method, but providing the user with relevant classes so they can check.\n\n We are also providing the method signatures to help the user override correctly.\n\n We output the function calls as a list.\n\n Important: The parameters must be passed as keyword arguments and in the order they appear in the function definition? Actually, the format does not specify order, but we can follow the order of the properties for clarity.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n [get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]\n\n However, note: the function get_signature has an optional parameter 'include_private'. We are not setting it, so it will default to False. That should be fine because we are interested in public methods (since they are being overridden).\n\n But wait: what if the methods are protected? In Java, protected methods are not private. The tool might not return protected methods if we set include_private=False? We don't know how the tool defines \"private\". The tool's description says: \"private methods and properties, which are typically denoted by a leading underscore\" - that sounds like Python. In Java, private members are denoted by being declared as private. The tool might be designed for multiple languages? The function get_imports has an enum for language. But get_signature does not. So we assume that the tool can handle Java and that the \"private\" flag in get_signature for Java would mean only private (with the private modifier) methods? Then protected and public are not private. So we should be safe.\n\n Alternatively, the user might need to see protected methods too? But the tool doesn't have a flag for protected. So we rely on the default (include_private=False) and hope that protected methods are included? The tool's description for get_signature: \"include_private: A flag to indicate whether to include private methods' signatures in the search.\" So by default, private methods are excluded. Protected methods are not private, so they should be included? We assume so.\n\n Therefore, we proceed.\n\n Final answer:\n\n [get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]"}

What's the area of a square with a side of size 5 cm?\n 2. What is the weather in Queenstown Singapore?\n\n We have two functions available:\n - get_current_weather(location: str, unit: str = 'fahrenheit')\n - get_area_of_square(size: float)\n\n For the first question, we note that the function get_area_of_square requires a 'size' parameter, which is a float. The side is given as 5 cm. However, note that the function does not specify units, so we can just use the number 5.0.\n\n For the second question, we need to use get_current_weather. The location should be provided as a string. The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\". We can format it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". Also, note that the function has an optional 'unit' parameter. Since the user didn't specify, we can use the default (fahrenheit) or if we prefer we can choose. However, without specification, we use the default.\n\n But note: the user might expect the weather in Celsius if they are in Singapore? However, the function defaults to fahrenheit. Since the question doesn't specify, we can either stick to the default or use our judgment. But the function allows us to specify. Since Singapore uses Celsius, it might be more appropriate to set unit to 'celsius'. However, the user did not specify, so we can also leave it as default. But note the function's default is fahrenheit. \n\n However, the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. But in this case, the function has a default for unit, so we don't have to provide it. But to be more user-friendly, we might want to get the weather in Celsius. But the problem does not require us to make that decision arbitrarily. Since the function has a default, we can rely on that. But let's look at the function description: it says the unit can be specified and the default is fahrenheit.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the user is asking about Singapore, which uses Celsius, so we can set unit to 'celsius'. However, the problem does not specify. Since we are allowed to choose, and to make the result more meaningful for the location, we choose 'celsius'.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" Here, the function requires 'location', which we have. The 'unit' is optional. So we don't have to point out anything.\n\n However, the problem is: we are to output function calls. We can call both functions in one go? The format allows multiple function calls in one response.\n\n So we can do:\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")]\n\n But note: the function get_area_of_square does not take a unit. The result will be in square cm? Actually, the function doesn't specify units. It just returns the area in the same unit squared. So the result of get_area_of_square(5.0) will be 25.0, meaning 25 square cm? The function doesn't care about the unit, it just does the math. So we are safe.\n\n However, the location string: the example in the function description says formats like \"San Francisco, CA\", \"Paris, France\", or \"New York, NY\". So we are using \"Queenstown, Singapore\", which is similar to \"Paris, France\".\n\n Alternatively, note that Queenstown is a district in Singapore. But the function expects a city and country (or state). Since Singapore is a city-state, we can represent it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\n But note: the function might not recognize \"Queenstown, Singapore\" because it is a district? We don't know how the backend is implemented. But the user asked for \"Queenstown Singapore\", so we provide that.\n\n We are going to output two function calls.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" Both functions are applicable.\n\n Therefore, we return:\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")]\n\n But wait: the function call format requires that we output exactly as specified. The parameters are named and we must use the exact names.\n\n Let's write it accordingly."}

The user is asking for music concerts or theater plays in Los Angeles on March 10th, 2023.\n The function Events_3_FindEvents can be used to find events. It requires:\n   - event_type: which can be either 'Music' or 'Theater'\n   - city: in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. Since the user mentioned Los Angeles, we can use 'Los Angeles, CA'\n   - date: optional, but we have a specific date so we can use '2023-03-10'\n\n However, note that the function Events_3_FindEvents can only take one event_type at a time. The user is asking for both music concerts and theater plays.\n Since the function does not allow multiple event types in one call, we have two options:\n   Option 1: Make two separate calls, one for 'Music' and one for 'Theater'\n   Option 2: Since the function allows the event_type to be one of the two, we cannot combine. So we must do two calls.\n\n Alternatively, note that the description says: \"Finds and lists cultural events, such as concerts and plays, that are scheduled to occur in a specified city.\"\n But the parameters require a single event_type. Therefore, we must call the function twice.\n\n Also note: the user said \"any\" meaning they are open to both.\n\n Let's break it down:\n\n We are to find:\n   - Music concerts in Los Angeles on 2023-03-10\n   - Theater plays in Los Angeles on 2023-03-10\n\n So we will call:\n   Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Music', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10')\n   Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Theater', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10')\n\n However, note that the function parameters for city: \"Use short form for the state.\" and we know Los Angeles is in California (CA).\n\n But note: the function also allows just the city? The description says: \"formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'\". \n But to be safe, we should use the state. So we use 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n We are to return two function calls? The format says we can return multiple function calls in one response.\n\n So the response should be:\n   [Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Music', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10'), Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Theater', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10')]\n\n But note: the function has a default for date as 'any'. We are specifying the date.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the user said \"this year is 2023\", so the full date is 2023-03-10.\n\n However, the function Events_3_FindEvents does not require the date (it's not in the required list) but we have it so we pass it.\n\n Let's write the function calls accordingly."}
{"id": "live_parallel_multiple_21-18-0", "result": "[Services_1_FindProvider(city='Sunnyvale, CA'), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')]", "input_token_count": 802, "output_token_count": 1057, "latency": 45.02149748802185, "reasoning_content": "We are given a task that involves two steps:\n1. Search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA (with no preference on unisex, so we can use the default 'dontcare').\n2. Book an appointment with the specific salon 'Elegant Styles' at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nHowever, note that the booking function requires the stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date.\nWe are directly given the salon name ('Elegant Styles'), time ('15:00'), and date ('2023-05-10').\n\nBut the task also asks to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA. We can use the FindProvider function for that.\n\nHowever, the user's request is to both search (for Sunnyvale) and then book with a specific salon. Since the booking is for a specific salon, we don't necessarily need the search result to book? But the user might want to verify that the salon exists? However, the function for booking doesn't require the city, only the stylist/salon name.\n\nBut note: the booking function might require the stylist's full name? Here the user provided the salon name. We are told that the stylist_name parameter can be the name of the salon. So we can book by salon name.\n\nWe can break down the task into two function calls:\n\nFirst, we can search for hair stylists in Sunnyvale, CA. This might return a list of salons including 'Elegant Styles'. However, the user already specified the salon they want to book. So the search might be for the purpose of confirming availability or just as a separate request? But the task says \"and also book\", so we do both.\n\nWe are not told to use the result of the search for booking, because we are given the salon name directly.\n\nSo we can do:\n1. Call FindProvider for Sunnyvale, CA (with is_unisex defaulting to 'dontcare') to get a list of salons (including Elegant Styles?).\n2. Then call BookAppointment with the given details.\n\nBut note: the booking function does not depend on the search. We can book without the search. However, the user asked for both. So we must do both.\n\nBut the problem: the user did not specify if the search is for Elegant Styles or just in general? The request is: \"search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA\" and then book with Elegant Styles. So the search is for Sunnyvale in general.\n\nWe'll call:\n1. Services_1_FindProvider(city='Sunnyvale, CA')  [Note: the format requires 'City, State (abbr)'. The user said 'Sunnyvale, CA'. But note: the state abbreviation is two letters, and CA is correct. Also, the example is 'New York, NY'. So we write 'Sunnyvale, CA'.]\n\n2. Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')\n\nBut note: the booking function does not take city. It only takes the stylist/salon name. So we are booking by the salon name. This is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must note that the booking might fail if the salon name is not unique? But that's beyond our control.\n\nWe are not asked to check the weather, so we don't use the weather function.\n\nSo the function calls are:\n[Services_1_FindProvider(city='Sunnyvale, CA'), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')]\n\nWait, the user wrote 'Elegant Styles', so we should use that. But note: in the booking function call, we have to use the exact string.\n\nBut note: the user's request is in one sentence. We are allowed to make multiple function calls? The instructions say: \"you will need to make one or more function/tool calls\". So we can make two.\n\nWe output both function calls in the required format.\n\nImportant: The function names must be exactly as provided.\n\nLet's write the function calls in the format:\n\n[Services_1_FindProvider(city='Sunnyvale, CA'), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')]\n\nBut note: the FindProvider function has an optional parameter 'is_unisex'. We are not specifying it, so it will use the default 'dontcare'. We don't need to include it.\n\nAlso, for the BookAppointment, we are providing all required parameters.\n\nSo this should be acceptable."}
