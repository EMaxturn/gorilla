It also has an optional 'return_residuals' parameter, which defaults to false but can be set to true.\n\n2. **data_loading**: This loads data from a CSV file. It requires 'file_path' and has an optional 'delimiter'.\n\nTo achieve this, I need to first load the data because the linear regression needs arrays for x and y, which come from the loaded data.\n\nSteps I need to take:\n\n1. Call **data_loading** to load the data from \"dataset.csv\". This will give me a data structure, probably a pandas DataFrame or similar, based on the description.\n\n2. Once the data is loaded, I can access 'sales' and 'future_sales' from it.\n\n3. Then, call **linear_regression_fit** with x as the array from data['sales'], y as the array from data['future_sales'], and set return_residuals to true.\n\nIn the tool call format, I have to output function calls directly. I can't process the data myself; I have to chain function calls.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to output one or more function calls in this response. Since loading data is a prerequisite, I should start with that.\n\nAfter loading the data, in a subsequent turn, I might need to call the linear regression function. But the prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nIn this setup, I think I need to output all necessary calls now, but I can't directly pass data from one function to another in my response. The functions are invoked sequentially by the system.\n\nLooking at the tool call format: I can call multiple functions in one response, like [func1(params), func2(params)].\n\nThe data_loading function will return some data structure, and then I can use that in the next function call. But in my response, I have to specify the parameters based on what I know now.\n\nThe user specified: \"x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']\", but I don't have the data yet. So, I need to first load the data.\n\nIn my function call for linear_regression_fit, I need to provide actual arrays for x and y, but I don't have them; I have to get them from data_loading.\n\nThis is a problem. The parameters for linear_regression_fit require 'x' and 'y' as arrays, but I can't provide them until after data_loading is called.\n\nPerhaps I need to call data_loading first, and then in a subsequent turn, use the result to call linear_regression_fit.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" And for multi-turn, it implies I might need multiple turns.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should just call data_loading, and then wait for the system to provide the result, after which I can call the next function.\n\nThe user's request is to do both in one go, but I have to break it down.\n\nLet me check the exact user message: \"Use the data from dataset.csv file and fit a linear regression model... by setting x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']. Additionally, calculate and return the residuals.\"\n\nI need to sequence this.\n\nIn my response, I can output multiple function calls, but the second one depends on the first.\n\nPerhaps the system handles the output of one function as input to the next, but in my call, I have to specify it correctly.\n\nFor linear_regression_fit, I need to provide x and y as parameters, which are arrays. But I don't have them yet.\n\nThis suggests I can't call linear_regression_fit until after data_loading.\n\nSo, probably, my first response should just be the data_loading call.\n\nThen, in the next turn, once I have the data, I can call linear_regression_fit.\n\nThe prompt doesn't specify how the system passes back results, but I think that's the implication.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that after data_loading, the data is available for me to reference.\n\nIn the tool description, it's just functions, and I have to call them with parameters.\n\nAnother way: maybe I can call data_loading, and in the same response, call linear_regression_fit with expressions like x=data['sales'], but the parameters require actual arrays, not strings.\n\nThe parameters for linear_regression_fit are: 'x': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'float'}} so it expects an actual array, not a string reference.\n\nIn the context of this system, when I output function calls, the system might execute them sequentially and use outputs.\n\nTo be safe, I should only output what I can now, which is data_loading.\n\nLet me think about the format: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)].\"\n\nI can list multiple, but for linear_regression_fit, I don't have the params yet.\n\nPerhaps the best is to call data_loading first.\n\nSo, my response should be: [data_loading(file_path='dataset.csv')]\n\nThen, in the next turn, the system might say something like \"Data loaded: {data}\", and then I can respond with the linear_regression_fit call.\n\nThat makes sense for multi-turn behavior.\n\nIf I try to call both, it might not work because I can't provide x and y.\n\nSo, I'll go with calling data_loading first."}
