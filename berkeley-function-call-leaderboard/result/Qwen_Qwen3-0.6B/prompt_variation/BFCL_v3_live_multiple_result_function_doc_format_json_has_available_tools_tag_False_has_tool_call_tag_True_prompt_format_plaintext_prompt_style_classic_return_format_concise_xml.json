They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned the account number, which is needed for the BankStatementOverView function. The parameters for that function include bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview needs totals and dates. \n\nThe user provided the account number, which should be the bank_name. The account type is checking, so account_type is 'checking'. The full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user provided those values: total_deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40, start balance $5,532.01, end balance $6,737.37. The dates are October 1 and 31, 2019. \n\nWait, the transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname, middlename, company_name. The user provided all these except maybe the transactions array. But the user didn't specify individual transactions, just the totals. However, the transaction_summary function's parameters include transactions as an array of dictionaries. Since the user didn't list individual transactions, maybe they expect the summary to include the totals and the dates. \n\nBut the user's question also mentions a summary of transactions. So perhaps the transaction_summary function can be used here. However, the parameters for that function include transactions, which the user hasn't provided. But maybe the user expects the summary to include the totals and the dates, even if transactions are not listed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary function can generate the summary based on the provided totals and dates. Let me check the parameters again. The transaction_summary function requires transactions, which is an array of dictionaries. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, perhaps the function can be called with the totals and dates, but that might not be accurate. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"include a summary of transactions for this period\". So maybe the transaction_summary function is the right one here. But the parameters for that function include transactions, which the user hasn't provided. However, the user might have intended to include the totals and dates in the summary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary function can be used with the given parameters, even if transactions are not provided. But the user's question doesn't mention individual transactions. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the functions again. The BankStatementOverView function can be used to get the overview, which includes account information and transaction summary. The transaction_summary function can generate a summary. \n\nSince the user wants both an overview and a transaction summary, perhaps the BankStatementOverView function can provide the overview, and the transaction_summary function can generate the summary. But the user hasn't provided the transactions array. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"include a summary of transactions for this period\". So maybe the transaction_summary function is the one to use here. But the parameters for that function require transactions, which the user hasn't provided. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary function can be called with the given totals and dates, even if transactions are not listed. But that might not be accurate. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"include a summary of transactions for this period\". So perhaps the transaction_summary function is the correct one here. But the parameters for that function require transactions, which the user hasn't provided. \n\nThis is a problem. The user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_summary function can't be used without those. Therefore, perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is the way to go. \n\nBut the user also wants a transaction summary. So maybe the transaction_summary function can be called with the given parameters, even if transactions are not provided. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary function can generate the summary based on the totals and dates. \n\nI think the correct approach here is to call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters and then the transaction_summary function if needed. But since the user hasn't provided transactions, perhaps the transaction_summary function can be called with the given totals and dates. \n\nWait, the transaction_summary function's parameters include transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname, middlename, company_name. The user provided all these except maybe the transactions array. But the user's question says \"include a summary of transactions\", so perhaps the transaction_summary function is the way to go. \n\nBut without the transactions array, maybe the function can't be called. Therefore, perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is the correct one here. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. \n\n2. Call transaction_summary with the given totals and dates. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the transactions array. However, the transaction_summary function's parameters include transactions, which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, maybe the transaction_summary function can't be called without those. \n\nThis is a problem. The user's question requires both an overview and a transaction summary, but without the transactions array, the transaction_summary function can't be used. Therefore, perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is the way to go. \n\nBut the user also wants a transaction summary. Maybe the transaction_summary function can be called with the given parameters, even if transactions are not provided. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary function can generate the summary based on the totals and dates. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct functions to call are BankStatementOverView and transaction_summary, but since transactions are not provided, the transaction_summary function might not be fully applicable. However, the user's question requires both, so perhaps the answer includes both functions with the provided parameters."}

The available functions are Hotels_4_ReserveHotel and Hotels_4_SearchHotel.\n\nThe user mentioned booking a hotel, so the function that handles reservations is Hotels_4_ReserveHotel. The parameters required for that function are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, and location. The user provided the stay length as 5 days, which is a duration in days. The check-in date is July 15th, so I need to format that as a date. The location is the studio sessions, so probably the city or town where the studio is. But the user didn't specify the location, so maybe I should assume a default? Wait, the parameters have defaults for place_name and location as 'dontcare'. But the user is asking to book a hotel, so they probably want to provide specific details. However, the user hasn't mentioned the exact location. Hmm, maybe the location is the studio's address, but since it's not provided, perhaps the function expects the user to input it. But the user's message doesn't include the location. Wait, the user says \"book on the 15th of July, 2nd staying for 5 days?\" So maybe the location is the studio's address. But since the user hasn't specified it, perhaps the function can take the default 'dontcare' for location. But the user might expect the location to be filled in. Wait, the parameters for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel have 'location' as a required parameter with a default of 'dontcare'. So even if the user doesn't specify, the function can use that. But the user is asking to book a hotel, so they probably want to provide the location. But since the user hasn't mentioned it, maybe the function can proceed with the default. However, the user's message doesn't include the location, so maybe I should ask for it. But according to the instructions, if the user's message lacks parameters, I should point it out. Wait, the user's message says \"book on the 15th of July, 2nd staying for 5 days?\" So they are asking to book a hotel, but the location isn't specified. Therefore, the function requires 'location' which is missing. So the correct approach is to point out that the location is required. But the user might have intended to provide it. Wait, maybe the location is the studio's address, but since it's not mentioned, perhaps the function can use the default. But the user's message doesn't include it. Therefore, the function call can't be made without the location. So the answer would be to point out that the location is required. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user's message doesn't include the location. Therefore, the function call can't be made. But the user is asking to book the hotel, so maybe the location is the studio's address. But since it's not provided, perhaps the function can proceed with the default. But the user's message doesn't specify it. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the location is required. However, the user's message doesn't mention it, so the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer is to state that the location is required. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. But the user's message doesn't include the location. So the function call can't be made. Therefore, the correct answer is to state that the location is required. But the user's message doesn't include it. So the function call can't be made.

The user mentioned finding songs similar to an album. Looking at the available functions, there's Music_3_LookupMusic. Its description says it finds songs based on artist, album, genre, and release year. The parameters include artist, album, genre, and year. The user specified the album as 'The New Classic' and the year as 2023. So, I should use Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'The New Classic' and year 2023.\n\nNext, they want tracks released around six years ago. The user mentioned \"six years ago\" which would be 2023 minus 6, which is 2017. But the year given is 2023. Wait, maybe they mean six years before 2023, so 2017. However, the function's year parameter is a four-digit number. So, I should set the year to 2017. But the user wrote \"This year is 2023\". Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check again. The user says \"six years ago\" and \"This year is 2023\". So, six years before 2023 would be 2017. So, the year parameter should be 2017. But the function's year parameter is a string, so I need to input '2017'.\n\nSo, the two functions needed are Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'The New Classic' and year 2023, and another call to Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'The New Classic' and year 2017.

But the function doesn't have a year parameter, so maybe the user's request can't be fully addressed. But given the available functions, the best option is to use the album parameter. So the function call would be Music_3_PlayMedia with track and album set to 'High Expectations'. Therefore, the answer is to call that function."}

There's get_service_providers and view_service_provider_profile. The get_service_providers function seems relevant here because it allows filtering by location, district, availability date, and other criteria. The parameters required for get_service_providers include avg_rating, province_id, district_name, start_available_date, end_available_date, min_age, max_age, has_quality_problem, has_late_check_in, is_excellent, is_package, is_subscription, service_id, available_for_pet, professional_group_id, job_qty, is_cleaning_condo, is_cleaning_home, is_cleaning_office.\n\nThe user mentioned Bangkok, so province_id should be 2. The district is Chatuchak, so district_name is \"Chatuchak\". The availability date is March 22, 2024, which needs to be in the correct format. The start and end dates need to be set. The user wants a good reputation, so maybe set has_quality_problem to True. However, the function parameters don't have a direct way to specify \"good reputation,\" so perhaps the default is okay. The user didn't mention age, so min_age and max_age can be set to null. The other parameters like is_package, is_subscription, etc., are optional. \n\nWait, the function's parameters include has_quality_problem, which is a boolean. The user wants options with a good reputation, so maybe set has_quality_problem to True. Also, the availability date is March 22, 2024. The start_available_date should be \"2024-03-22T14:00:00\" if the user wants availability from 14:00. But the user didn't specify check-in time, so maybe leave start_available_date as null or set it to the date. The end_available_date is not specified, so maybe leave it as null. \n\nSo, the parameters needed are avg_rating (default is None, but maybe set to 4 if good), province_id=2, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", start_available_date=\"2024-03-22T14:00:00\", end_available_date=\"2024-03-22T14:00:00\" (assuming availability is from 14:00), and has_quality_problem=True. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention age, so min_age and max_age can be set to null. The other parameters like is_package, is_subscription, etc., are optional. So the function call would include those. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is get_service_providers with the specified parameters. The view_service_provider_profile isn't needed here since the user is looking for providers, not individual profiles."}

Since they want actively configured, I should set status_filter to 'active'. Also, include_metadata is optional, but maybe they want metadata included. But the question doesn't specify, so maybe just set status_filter to active. \n\nThen, there's website_configuration_api.WebsiteConfigurationApi.get_website, which requires a websiteId. But the user didn't provide a specific website ID, so maybe that's not needed here. The get_websites function is more general. \n\nSo the correct function to call is get_websites with status_filter set to 'active'. That should retrieve the actively configured websites. No other parameters are required. I don't see any other functions relevant here. So the answer is to call get_websites with status_filter active."}

Let me check its parameters. The required parameters are service_name, configurations. The configurations dict needs timeout, retry_count, endpoint, and auth_required. The user provided all these: service_name is 'fdsa', timeout 30, retry 5, endpoint is given, and auth_required is True. The default for auth_required is True, so maybe it's already set, but the user specified it, so I should include it. The other parameters are correct. So I need to call add_service_config with service_name 'fdsa', configurations containing timeout 30, retry_count 5, endpoint 'https://api.fdsa-service.com', and auth_required True. The other functions like get_service_configs and order_service_config aren't needed here. So the correct function call is add_service_config with those parameters."}

The parameters are all required, so I need to use that. The user provided February 15th 2022, so day is 15, month is 2, year is 2022. The other function, 'get_monitoring_state', doesn't seem relevant here. The 'get_hosts_per_month' function also needs month and year, but the user is asking for a specific day, not a monthly count.

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration with the name 'UrgentAlert77f7', an error rate threshold of 5%, and send notifications to 'admin@example.com' and 'support@example.com'. \n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. The user mentioned a global configuration, so probably the create_global_application_alert_config function is needed here.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for create_global_application_alert_config: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled. The user provided the name, threshold (5%), and recipients. The alert_type isn't specified, but the enum includes error_rate. So I'll set alert_type to 'error_rate'. The enabled parameter is set to True by default, but maybe the user wants it enabled, so I'll include it.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention the app ID, but since it's a global configuration, maybe the app ID isn't required. The function's parameters don't require it. So I can omit it. The recipients are given as two email addresses. \n\nSo the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with name 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type 'error_rate', threshold 0.05 (since 5% is 0.05), and recipients ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required fields are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The enabled is optional but maybe the user wants it enabled. Since the default is True, but maybe the user wants it enabled, but the question doesn't specify. However, the function's default is True, so including it might be redundant. But since the user didn't mention it, perhaps it's better to include it as a parameter. \n\nWait, the parameters for create_global_application_alert_config have enabled as a boolean with default True. So even if the user doesn't specify, it's okay. So the function call would include name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled as True. \n\nSo the final function call would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\ncreate_global_application_alert_config\n    name=\"UrgentAlert77f7\"\n    alert_type=\"error_rate\"\n    threshold=0.05\n    recipients=[\"admin@example.com\", \"support@example.com\"]\n    enabled=True\n</TOOLCALL>"}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the get_shareable_api_tokens function, which requires a user_id. The parameters for that function include user_id and include_revoked. The user provided their ID, so I can use that. But the user might not have revoked tokens, so maybe include_revoked is optional. However, the function's required parameter is user_id, so I need to include that.\n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, which requires include_expired and page and page_size. But the user hasn't specified page or page_size, so maybe I should use default values. However, the user might not need pagination, so perhaps just get all tokens without specifying page or size. But the function's parameters are required, so I need to include them. Wait, the required parameters for get_api_tokens are include_expired, page, and page_size. But the user hasn't provided those. So maybe I can't call that function without those parameters. But the user's request is to get all tokens, so maybe I should use the get_api_tokens function with default values, but the default values might not be sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants all tokens, so perhaps the get_api_tokens function with include_expired=False and page_size=20, but that's just a guess.\n\nAnother function is post_api_token, which requires username, password, token_name, expiry_date, and permissions. But the user hasn't provided those, so that's not applicable here.\n\nSo the user needs all API tokens. The functions available are get_shareable_api_tokens and get_api_tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens requires user_id, which is provided. The get_api_tokens requires include_expired, page, and page_size. Since the user hasn't specified those, maybe I should use the default values. But the user might not need pagination, so perhaps just call get_api_tokens with include_expired=False and page_size=20. However, the user might not have provided page or size, so maybe the function can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, so using get_api_tokens with include_expired=False and page_size=20, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, the user's question is to \"get all API tokens now\". The functions available are get_shareable_api_tokens and get_api_tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens is for shareable tokens, which might not be the same as all tokens. The get_api_tokens function is for retrieving all tokens, including those that are expired. So perhaps the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with default parameters, assuming that the user wants all tokens, including expired ones. But the user hasn't specified page or size, so maybe the function can handle it. Therefore, the correct function calls would be to use get_api_tokens with include_expired=False and page_size=20, but since the user hasn't provided those, maybe the function can be called with default values. However, the parameters for get_api_tokens are required, so including include_expired, page, and page_size is necessary. Since the user hasn't provided those, perhaps the function can be called with default values, even though they might not be sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the function can handle it without those parameters. \n\nWait, looking back at the parameters for get_api_tokens, the required parameters are include_expired, page, and page_size. The user hasn't provided any of these. So perhaps the function can't be called without those parameters. Therefore, the user's request can't be fulfilled with the given functions unless those parameters are provided. But the user hasn't mentioned page or size, so maybe the function can be called with default values. However, the parameters are required, so even if the user doesn't specify, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=False, page=1, page_size=20, but the user might not have provided those. \n\nBut the user's question is to get all API tokens, so maybe the get_api_tokens function is the right one. Since the user provided their user ID, perhaps the get_shareable_api_tokens function isn't the right one. The user might need to get all tokens, so the correct function is get_api_tokens. Therefore, the function calls would be to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=False, page=1, page_size=20. But the user hasn't specified page or size, so maybe the function can be called with those defaults. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants all tokens, so the get_api_tokens function can be called with include_expired=False and page_size=20, but without page. However, the parameters are required, so including page is necessary. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Since the user hasn't provided page or size, perhaps the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct answer is to call get_api_tokens with default parameters, even though they might not be sufficient. But the user's question requires all API tokens, so maybe the get_api_tokens function is the right one. \n\nIn conclusion, the user needs all API tokens, so the correct function to call is get_api_tokens with include_expired=False and page_size=20, assuming that the user wants all tokens. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens>\n  <param name=\"include_expired\">False</param>\n  <param name=\"page\">1</param>\n  <param name=\"page_size\">20</param>\n</api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens>\n</TOOLCALL>"}
