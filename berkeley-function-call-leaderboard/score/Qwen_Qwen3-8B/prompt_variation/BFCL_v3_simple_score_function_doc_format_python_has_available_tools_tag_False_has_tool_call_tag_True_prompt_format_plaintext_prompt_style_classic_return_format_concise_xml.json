The user wants to predict the total expected profit from investing $5000 in stocks XYZ over 5 years with an annual return rate of 7%. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's the investment.predictProfit function. Let me look at its parameters. It requires investment_amount (int), annual_return (float), and years (int). \n\nThe user provided all three: $5000 is the investment amount, 7% is the annual return, and 5 years. So I need to convert 7% into a decimal for the function. Wait, the function expects annual_return as a float. So 7% would be 0.07. \n\nWait, but maybe the function expects it as 7.0? The description says annual_return is a float, so 7.0 would be correct. Let me confirm. The user said 7%, so converting that to 0.07 is standard, but maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Wait, the function's parameter is annual_return, which is a float. So if the user says 7%, the correct value would be 0.07. But sometimes, functions might expect the percentage as 7.0. Hmm, but the description says \"annual return rate\", which is typically a decimal. So 7% would be 0.07. However, maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Wait, the user input is 7%, so the actual value should be 0.07. But I need to check if the function expects it as a percentage (like 7) or as a decimal (0.07). The function's docstring says \"annual return rate of the investment\", which is usually expressed as a decimal. For example, 7% would be 0.07. But sometimes, people might input 7 as the percentage. However, the function's parameter is a float, so it's safer to use 0.07. Wait, but maybe the function is designed to take the percentage as a whole number, like 7, and then internally convert it to 0.07. But the problem is that the user's input is 7%, so the correct value should be 0.07. However, the function's parameter is a float, so either 7.0 or 0.07 would be acceptable. Wait, no. If the annual return rate is 7%, then the correct value is 0.07 (7%)? No, wait. Let me think again. If the function requires parameters, I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the total profit after 5 years. The function is not available.
