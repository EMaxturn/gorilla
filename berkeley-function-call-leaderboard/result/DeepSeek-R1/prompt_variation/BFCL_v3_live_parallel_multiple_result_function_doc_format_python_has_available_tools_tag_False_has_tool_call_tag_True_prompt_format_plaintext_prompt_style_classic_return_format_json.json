We don't specify a destination, so it will clone to the current directory.\n   We don't need recursive (default false) and we don't need a shallow clone (so omit depth).\n\n Step 2: Analyse the contents of the repo and create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - First, we need to know the directory name. Since the repo is `nodejs-welcome.git`, the directory created will be `nodejs-welcome`.\n   - We can use `analyse_repo_contents` to determine the predominant programming language? But note: the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the language. However, the task says to create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis.\n\n   However, note that the functions provided do not have one that returns the analysis in a way that we can programmatically use for creating the Dockerfile? Actually, the task says:\n        \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\"\n\n   But the function `create_a_docker_file` only takes a `directory_name`. It doesn't take any analysis result. Similarly, the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` takes parameters that we have to provide.\n\n   Since the task says \"based on the analysis\", we might need to get the analysis to know the language? But note: the function `create_a_docker_file` might internally do the analysis? However, looking at the function description, it doesn't say that. It just says \"Generates a Dockerfile\".\n\n   We are not given a function that returns the analysis in a structured way for us to use. Therefore, we can assume that:\n     - The function `create_a_docker_file` will create a Dockerfile suitable for the project by looking at the directory? But the function description doesn't specify how it determines the base image, etc.\n\n   Alternatively, the step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\", so we might need to first run `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language, and then use that language to create the Dockerfile? But note the function `create_a_docker_file` does not take the language as a parameter.\n\n   Given the functions available, it seems we are expected to call:\n     - `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language? But the task doesn't require us to use the language for anything else? Actually, the next step is to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n   However, note that the function `create_a_docker_file` does not require the language. It might be that this function internally does the analysis? The function description doesn't say. Similarly, the Kubernetes YAML function doesn't depend on the language.\n\n   So, we can skip the explicit analysis for the purpose of creating the Dockerfile? The task says \"analyse the contents\" and then create. It might be that the analysis step is to be done by the `create_a_docker_file` function.\n\n   Alternatively, the task might require us to use the `analyse_repo_contents` function to log or to determine if we should proceed? But the task doesn't specify.\n\n   Since the task says \"Do all the following using the steps\", and step 2.1 is to create the Dockerfile, we can just create it.\n\n   However, note: the function `create_a_docker_file` requires a directory name. We know the directory is `nodejs-welcome`.\n\n   Similarly, for the Kubernetes YAML, we have to call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with parameters. The task doesn't specify the parameters, so we have to choose defaults.\n\n   For Kubernetes:\n        directory_name: same as above, 'nodejs-welcome'\n        deployment_name: we can use the directory name? Or let it default? The function has a parameter `deployment_name` but it is required? Actually, the function signature says:\n            deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n\n        But note: the function signature says \"use Defaults if not provided\", meaning we can omit? Actually, in the function description, it's listed without a default. So we must provide? Let me check:\n\n          create_kubernetes_yaml_file parameters:\n            directory_name (str): required.\n            deployment_name (str): required? It says \"The name to assign ... use Defaults if not provided.\" -> This is ambiguous. Since the function signature in the docstring says it's required? Actually, in the function description, it doesn't say \"default\" for deployment_name. So we must provide.\n\n        However, the description says \"use Defaults if not provided\", meaning we can leave it out? But the function call requires it? We don't know the implementation.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we can set:\n            deployment_name: we can set it to the directory name? e.g., 'nodejs-welcome-deployment'\n            image_name: we don't have one yet? The task doesn't specify. We can use a placeholder? The function has a default for image_name: default='latest'. But note: the default for image_name is 'latest'. That doesn't make sense because an image name is more than a tag. We might have to set it to something? But the task doesn't specify.\n\n        Since the task doesn't specify the image name, we can set it to the directory name? But note: the function expects an image name. We don't have one built yet? This might be a placeholder for when the image is built.\n\n        We'll set:\n            image_name: 'nodejs-welcome-image:latest'   (but note the function has a default of 'latest' which is only a tag. So we should provide a full image name? The function doesn't specify. We have to assume that the user will later build the image and tag it appropriately.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the image_name to the directory name? Let's set it to the directory name with a tag: e.g., 'nodejs-welcome:latest'\n\n        Other parameters for Kubernetes:\n            replicas: default 1\n            port: we don't know. The task doesn't specify. We can set to default 80? But the application might run on a different port. We don't know. We can set to 80 and then the user can update? Or we can leave it as 80 and hope the application is set to 80? Alternatively, we could look at the Dockerfile? But we haven't created it yet.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the port to a common port for Node.js, which is 3000? But the task doesn't specify. We'll use the default 80? Actually, the function default is 80.\n\n        service_type: default 'ClusterIP'\n\n   So for Kubernetes YAML, we'll set:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        deployment_name: 'nodejs-welcome-deployment'\n        image_name: 'nodejs-welcome:latest'\n        replicas: 1\n        port: 80\n        service_type: 'ClusterIP'\n\n   But note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` might create a deployment and service in one file? We don't know. We just call it.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes.\n   We don't have a function to do a git add? But note the function `push_git_changes_to_github` says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So we don't need to do a separate add.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push.\n   We use `push_git_changes_to_github` with:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        commit_message: We can use the default 'Update changes'\n        branch_name: default 'main'\n        force_push: default False\n\n However, note: the task says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then step 4 is \"commit / push\". But the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does both? The description says: \"Pushes all changes ... This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So it does the add, commit and push.\n\n Therefore, we can skip step 3 as it's included in step 4.\n\n Steps in function calls:\n\n  1. Clone the repo.\n  2. Create Dockerfile in the cloned directory.\n  3. Create Kubernetes YAML in the cloned directory.\n  4. Push the changes (which will add, commit and push).\n\n But note: the task says step 2.1 and 2.2 must be based on the analysis. We haven't done an explicit analysis. We have two options:\n\n   Option A: Call `analyse_repo_contents` and then use the result to decide how to create the Dockerfile? But the function `create_a_docker_file` doesn't take the language. So we cannot use the result.\n\n   Option B: Assume that `create_a_docker_file` does the analysis internally? We don't know. Since the function is named `create_a_docker_file` and it takes the directory, it might look at the files in the directory to determine the base image.\n\n   We are going to call `analyse_repo_contents` for step 2? The step says \"analyse the contents of the repo\", so we should call it. But note: the task doesn't say what to do with the analysis. It just says \"based on the analysis\". So we can call it and then proceed to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n   However, the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the language? We don't have a function that uses that language. Therefore, we might skip it? But the task requires it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can call `analyse_repo_contents` and then log the result? But we are not required to log. We are only to return function calls.\n\n   Since the task says to do the steps, and step 2 is \"analyse the contents\", we must call `analyse_repo_contents`.\n\n   So step 2: \n        First, call `analyse_repo_contents` with directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        Then, call `create_a_docker_file` for the same directory.\n        Then, call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` for the same directory.\n\n   The analysis result might be used by the `create_a_docker_file` function? But we are not passing it. So it's independent.\n\n   We are just fulfilling the steps.\n\n Therefore, the sequence of function calls:\n\n  1. clone_repo: \n        repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n        destination: default (current directory) -> we can omit.\n        recursive: default false -> omit.\n        depth: omit.\n\n  2. analyse_repo_contents:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n  3. create_a_docker_file:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n  4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        deployment_name: 'nodejs-welcome-deployment'\n        image_name: 'nodejs-welcome:latest'\n        replicas: 1\n        port: 80\n        service_type: 'ClusterIP'\n\n  5. push_git_changes_to_github:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        commit_message: 'Update changes' (default)\n        branch_name: 'main' (default)\n        force_push: false (default)\n\n But note: the task says step 3 is \"add all changed file to git changes\", but we are including it in step 4 (via the push function). So we are covering step 3 and 4 with one call.\n\n However, the task says step 3 is separate? But the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does the add. So it's okay.\n\n Let's write the function calls in the required JSON format.\n\n Important: The order of the calls matters. We must clone first, then analyse, then create the files, then push.\n\n We'll output multiple tool calls in one go? But note the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". So we can output a list of multiple tool calls.\n\n However, the system might execute them in order? We assume sequential execution.\n\n Let me write the JSON:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"clone_repo\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\",\n      \"deployment_name\": \"nodejs-welcome-deployment\",\n      \"image_name\": \"nodejs-welcome:latest\",\n      \"replicas\": 1,\n      \"port\": 80,\n      \"service_type\": \"ClusterIP\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nNote: For the push function, we are using all the defaults for the other parameters. So we only need to set directory_name.\n\nBut note: the push function has a default branch of 'main'. We assume the cloned repo is on the 'main' branch? If it's on a different branch, we might have to adjust? The task doesn't specify. We'll go with the default.\n\nLet's output the tool call."}

Find relevant classes that might be related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories.\n    - We can use the function `get_relevant_classes` with `search_string` as \"CellResult\" and `include_subdirectories` set to True.\n 2. Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n    - We can use the function `get_signature` for each method in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\n However, note that the user is working in a Java project, but the functions provided are for Python. But the problem states that the functions are in Python format, but we are to use them for a Java project? \n But looking at the function descriptions, they are generic and do not specify a language. We have to assume that the repository is in Java? \n\n The function `get_relevant_classes` is about retrieving class names from the repository. The function `get_signature` is about retrieving the signature of a method in a given class.\n\n Steps:\n 1. For the first task, we'll call `get_relevant_classes` with:\n      search_string: \"CellResult\"\n      include_subdirectories: True   (since the user said including subdirectories)\n\n 2. For the second task, we need to get the signatures for two methods in the class \"AbstractCellHandler\":\n      - method_name: \"setCellValue\"\n      - method_name: \"getCellValue\"\n\n However, note that the function `get_signature` requires the class name and method name. We have to call it twice? But the function can be called once per method. Since we are allowed multiple tool calls, we can do two calls.\n\n Alternatively, we could use `get_class_info` for the class \"AbstractCellHandler\" and then extract the signatures for the two methods? But the function `get_class_info` returns information about the methods, properties, and constructor. It might include the signatures? But the problem says we have a function `get_signature` specifically for the signature of a method.\n\n However, note the description of `get_class_info`: it retrieves information about methods, properties, and constructor. It does not specify that it returns the signatures. So we are better off using `get_signature` for each method.\n\n But wait, the function `get_signature` requires the class name and method name. We know the class name (\"AbstractCellHandler\") and the two method names. So we can do:\n\n   First call for setCellValue:\n        class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n        method_name: \"setCellValue\"\n\n   Second call for getCellValue:\n        class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n        method_name: \"getCellValue\"\n\n However, note that the user is overriding these methods in 'StringNumberHandler'. We are asked to ensure they are overriding correctly, so we need the signatures of the methods in the superclass.\n\n Also, note that the function `get_signature` has an optional parameter `include_private` which we don't need because these are public methods? But we can leave it as default (False) and not include it.\n\n Plan for tool calls:\n\n We are going to make three tool calls:\n\n  1. get_relevant_classes for \"CellResult\"\n  2. get_signature for \"setCellValue\" in \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n  3. get_signature for \"getCellValue\" in \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n\n But note: the problem says \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". We are making three calls in one turn? The format allows an array of tool calls.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>```json ... ```</TOOLCALL>\". And the example shows an array of multiple function calls.\n\n So we can do:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"get_relevant_classes\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"search_string\": \"CellResult\",\n      \"include_subdirectories\": true\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"get_signature\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"class_name\": \"AbstractCellHandler\",\n      \"method_name\": \"setCellValue\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"get_signature\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"class_name\": \"AbstractCellHandler\",\n      \"method_name\": \"getCellValue\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function `get_relevant_classes` also has a parameter `case_sensitive` which we are not setting, so it will default to false. That's acceptable because we don't know the case and the user didn't specify.\n\n However, what if the class \"AbstractCellHandler\" is not in the root? We are not providing a module name? The function `get_signature` does not have a module_name parameter. The function `get_class_info` does have an optional module_name, but `get_signature` does not. So we assume that the class is known in the current context? Or the tool will search the entire project? \n\n The description of `get_signature` does not mention module. So we assume the tool can find the class by name in the project.\n\n Alternatively, if we are concerned about the module, we might first use `get_relevant_classes` for \"AbstractCellHandler\" to see where it is? But the user is already extending it, so it must be known. We'll proceed.\n\n However, note that the user's error is about a method 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. We are searching for classes related to 'CellResult' to help the user find the correct class that has the method.\n\n Let's write the tool calls accordingly."}

Alternatively, we can try to use a more general category?\n        Looking at the function, the event_type is a string. The problem: the function does not specify what types are allowed.\n        Since the user's request is for two types, we have two options:\n          Option 1: Make two separate calls, one for 'concert' and one for 'theater' (or 'play'?).\n          Option 2: Try to use a broader category that might include both? But the function does not have such.\n\n        Given the instructions, we should use the function as provided. Let's break it down:\n\n        The user said: \"music concerts or theater plays\".
