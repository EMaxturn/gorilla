The user wants to log their food intake. They mentioned two separate meals: first, 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea. Then earlier, two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\n\nLooking at the available function, log_food, which requires food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, and optionally meal_type and log_date. The meal_type has enums like breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, defaulting to snack. Log_date is optional, defaulting to None.\n\nFirst, the user said \"Earlier I had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\" So that's probably a snack or maybe breakfast? But since they mentioned \"earlier,\" maybe they want to log that first. Wait, the order in the user's message is important. They first mention the mango and chai tea, then earlier the pizza and coffee. So the pizza and coffee happened earlier, so maybe the log_date for that should be earlier than the mango and chai tea.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified dates, so maybe the default log_date is okay.
