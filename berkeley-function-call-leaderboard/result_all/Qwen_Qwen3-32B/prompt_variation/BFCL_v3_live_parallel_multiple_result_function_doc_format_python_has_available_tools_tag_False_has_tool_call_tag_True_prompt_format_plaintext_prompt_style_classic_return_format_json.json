The example given uses commas to separate these parts. \n\nFor the first part, \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" would be the command to start the air conditioner in the living room.

The given URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. So I'll call that function with the provided URL. The destination is not specified, so it will default to the current directory.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name should be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the destination was default). The analysis will help decide the Dockerfile and Kubernetes setup.\n\nOnce the analysis is done, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, it's 'nodejs-welcome'. The function will generate a Dockerfile based on the analysis, which for a Node.js project would likely use a Node.js base image.\n\nThen, create the Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name. The deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type can be defaults since the user didn't specify. The image name might be derived from the repo, but since it's not provided, 'latest' is the default. Replicas default to 1, port 80, and service type ClusterIP.\n\nAfter creating the files, push the changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs the directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory is 'nodejs-welcome', commit message is 'Update changes' by default, branch is 'main' by default. Force push is false unless specified.\n\nWait, the user mentioned step 2.1 and 2.2, which depend on the analysis. So after cloning, analyze the repo to get the language, then create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. The functions need to be called in order: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, then push_git_changes_to_github. Each step depends on the previous one. The analysis result will inform the Dockerfile and Kubernetes setup. But the functions don't take the analysis result as a parameter; they just use the directory. So the process is correct as per the given functions.\n\nSo the function calls should be in sequence: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAML, then push. The parameters are as per the given functions. The user didn't specify deployment name, image name, etc., so defaults are used. The commit message and branch are also defaults unless changed.

The generate_human_image has image_quality as a string (high, medium), while generate_image uses an integer. The user specified \"high quality,\" so using generate_human_image with image_quality='high' makes sense. Also, the format is PNG by default. The prompt includes complex patterns and style references, so using generate_image might be more flexible. Hmm, but the user mentioned a human subject. Let me decide between the two.

The user wants to find out Shishir's birthday from previous conversations and send a congrats message.\n\nFirst, I need to check how to retrieve past conversations. The available functions include recall_memory_search, which searches prior conversation history. So I should use that with the query \"Shishir's birthday\". The function requires a query, page number (default 0), and optional heartbeat request. Let's start with page 0.\n\nOnce I get the search results, if there's a match, I can extract the birthday date. Then use send_message to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir. The send_message function needs the message, recipient, and urgent flag. The recipient here would be Shishir, but the parameter expects an identifier like email. Wait, the user didn't specify Shishir's contact info. Hmm, maybe the recipient is inferred from memory? But the function requires a string. If the previous conversation has Shishir's email or username, the search would include that. So after recalling, I can parse the recipient from the memory. But in the current setup, I need to call send_message with the recipient. If the initial search doesn't provide the recipient, I might need to handle that. But the user is asking to send the message regardless, so maybe the recipient is known from context. Alternatively, maybe the send_message function's recipient can be set to \"Shishir\" if that's a valid identifier in the system. But the function's description says recipient could be username, phone, or email. Assuming that \"Shishir\" is a valid username here, I can proceed. So after recalling, if the birthday is found, then send the message with recipient as Shishir's identifier. But how to get that identifier? The problem is that the user hasn't provided it, so maybe the previous conversation has that info. So the first step is to search for Shishir's birthday in the memory, which might include his contact details. Once that's retrieved, then send the message. But in the function calls, I need to make the search first, then based on the result, send the message. However, the current setup requires me to output the function calls. So first, call recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\", then based on the result, call send_message. But since the assistant can't process the result in the same turn, maybe the user expects a single function call. Wait, the instructions say to make one or more function calls in the current turn. So perhaps the assistant should first call recall_memory_search, and then in the next turn, after receiving the result, call send_message. But the user is asking to do both in one go? Or the assistant needs to chain the calls. However, the system processes each turn step by step. So in this case, the first step is to perform the search. The assistant can't know the result yet, so the first function call is recall_memory_search. Then, once the result is obtained, the next step would be to send the message. But since the user is asking for both actions in one turn, maybe the assistant can only initiate the search. Wait, the user says \"regardless\", so maybe even if the birthday isn't found, send the message. But that's conflicting. Wait, the user says \"find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\". So maybe the user wants to send the message regardless of whether the birthday is found. But that doesn't make sense. Probably, the user wants to find the birthday first, then send the message. But if the birthday isn't found, maybe send it anyway? The \"regardless\" might mean to send the message regardless of the outcome. Hmm. The user's phrasing is a bit ambiguous. But the main steps are: 1. Search for Shishir's birthday in previous conversations. 2. Send a congrats message. So the first function call is recall_memory_search. Then, once the birthday is found, send the message. But since the assistant can't process the result in the same turn, the user would have to handle it in subsequent turns. Therefore, the correct first step is to call recall_memory_search with the query \"Shishir's birthday\". The send_message would come later after the search result is known. So the initial function call is recall_memory_search. The parameters are query: \"Shishir's birthday\", page: 0, and maybe request_heartbeat to trigger the next step. So the tool call would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>```json\n[{\"function\":\"recall_memory_search\",\"parameters\":{\"query\":\"Shishir's birthday\",\"page\":0,\"request_heartbeat\":true}}]\n```</TOOLCALL>\n\nThen, after the search result is retrieved, the next step would be to send the message.

They're having a compilation error in their Java project involving the StringNumberHandler class. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want two things: first, to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository including subdirectories, and second, to get the method signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to check their overrides.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding relevant classes for 'CellResult'. The user mentioned including subdirectories. Looking at the available functions, get_relevant_classes seems appropriate. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive (default false), and include_subdirectories (default false). Since they want subdirectories included, I need to set include_subdirectories to True. The search_string is 'CellResult'. So the first function call would be get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True.\n\nNext, for the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The user specified 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The get_signature function is the right choice here. Each method requires class_name, method_name, and include_private (default false). Since the user didn't mention private methods, include_private can stay as default. So two separate calls to get_signature for each method, with class_name='AbstractCellHandler' and the respective method names.\n\nWait, but the functions are in Python format. The user is working in Java, but the functions don't specify language, so that's okay. The parameters are straightforward. Also, the module_name is optional for get_class_info, but since the user is asking about method signatures, they need to use get_signature, not get_class_info here.\n\nI need to make sure that all parameters are correctly provided. For get_relevant_classes, the search_string is 'CellResult', case_sensitive is false by default, but the user didn't specify case sensitivity, so we can leave it as default. However, since they want to include subdirectories, set include_subdirectories=True.\n\nFor the method signatures, two separate calls to get_signature with each method name. The include_private is default false, which is correct since the user is overriding public methods. So the function calls should be correct.\n\nNo parameters are missing here. The user provided the class names and method names. So the final answer should have three function calls: one get_relevant_classes and two get_signature calls."}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method found for get_weather(String). They want to know the available methods and properties of the 'Weather' class and the signature of the 'get_weather' method if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to check what functions are available. The get_class_info function can retrieve info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. So I should call that with class_name set to 'Weather'. The include_private parameter is optional, defaulting to False, which is fine unless the user wants private members, which they didn't mention. The module_name is optional, but if the Weather class is in a different module, maybe it's needed. However, the user didn't specify, so I'll leave it out for now.\n\nNext, the user also wants the signature of the 'get_weather' method in the same class. For that, the get_signature function is appropriate. It requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. Again, include_private is default False. So I'll call get_signature with class_name 'Weather' and method_name 'get_weather'.\n\nWait, but what if the Weather class isn't in the current module? The get_class_info might not find it. But the user hasn't provided a module name, so I have to assume it's in the current module. If that's not the case, the function might return no info, but that's beyond our control here. We can only use the functions as provided.\n\nSo the two function calls would be get_class_info for Weather and get_signature for get_weather in Weather.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. The parameters required are a and b, both non-negative. Since 36 and 48 are both positive integers, I can use this function. The larger number is 48, but the function's parameters don't specify that a has to be larger, but the description mentions a is the first and larger. Wait, the function's Args say a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So maybe I should pass 48 as a and 36 as b? Or does it matter? Well, GCD is commutative, so the order shouldn't affect the result. But to follow the function's specifications, maybe a should be the larger one. Let me check the function's Args again. The description says a is the first and larger non-negative integer. So I should pass a=48 and b=36. But wait, the user said 36 and 48. The function's parameters are a and b, but the order might not matter since GCD(36,48) is the same as GCD(48,36). However, the function's Args specify that a is the larger one. So to be precise, I should set a=48 and b=36. But the user provided 36 and 48 in that order. Hmm, but the function's parameter for a is described as the first and larger. So maybe the user's input order doesn't matter here; the function expects a as the larger. So I'll use a=48 and b=36.\n\nNow, the second part: the steepness of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. Steepness is the derivative. The function estimate_derivative can be used here. The parameters needed are function, x, dx (optional), and method (optional). The function is f(x) = x\u00b2, which in Python can be represented as a lambda function or a callable. Since the user is using the function estimate_derivative, I need to pass the function as a callable. However, in the context of the tool call, how is the function passed? The user's question mentions f(x) = x\u00b2, so the function parameter should be a reference to that. But in the tool call, how do I represent that? The function estimate_derivative expects the function as a parameter. Since the user is asking about x\u00b2, I can represent it as a lambda function, but in the JSON parameters, how is that handled? Wait, the tool call is in JSON format, so perhaps the function is passed as a string, but the actual implementation would need to parse that. However, the user's provided functions are in Python, so maybe the function is passed as a Python callable. But in the tool call, the parameters are in JSON, so perhaps the function is represented as a string, like \"lambda x: x**2\". But I'm not sure. The problem is that in the tool call, the function parameter needs to be a callable, but JSON doesn't support Python functions directly. However, the user's system might have a way to interpret that. Alternatively, maybe the function is passed as a string that can be evaluated. For example, the function could be written as \"lambda x: x**2\", and then in the actual code, it's evaluated. But since the user is using a tool call, perhaps the system expects the function to be passed as a string that can be converted into a Python function. \n\nAssuming that the system can handle that, I'll proceed. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2, so the parameter function would be \"lambda x: x**2\". The x value is 5. The dx is optional, defaulting to 0.0001, and the method defaults to 'central'. So the parameters for estimate_derivative would be function: \"lambda x: x**2\", x: 5. \n\nPutting it all together, the tool calls would be first math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, then estimate_derivative with the function, x=5. \n\nWait, but the user's question says \"how steep the curve... is at x=5\". The derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x, so at x=5, the derivative is 10. The estimate_derivative function should approximate this. The method used (central, forward, backward) affects the approximation, but with a small dx, it should be close to 10. \n\nSo the two function calls needed are math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, and estimate_derivative with function as x\u00b2, x=5. \n\nNow, translating this into the required JSON format for the tool calls. The first function is math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. The second is estimate_derivative with function as a string that represents the function. However, in Python, the function parameter expects a callable. But in the tool call, how is this represented? The user's system might require the function to be passed as a string that can be evaluated. For example, if the function is written as \"lambda x: x**2\", then when the tool is executed, it can be converted into a lambda function. \n\nTherefore, the parameters for estimate_derivative would be:\n- function: \"lambda x: x**2\"\n- x: 5\n- dx: 0.0001 (default, so optional)\n- method: \"central\" (default, so optional)\n\nSo the JSON for the tool calls would be:\n\n[\n  {\"function\": \"math_gcd\", \"parameters\": {\"a\": 48, \"b\": 36}},\n  {\"function\": \"estimate_derivative\", \"parameters\": {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}}\n]\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The math_gcd function requires a and b as integers. The estimate_derivative requires the function as a string that can be converted into a callable, x as a float or integer. Since x is 5, it's an integer but can be passed as 5.0. However, the function accepts a float, so passing 5 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final tool calls should be these two functions."}

The user wants me to first calculate the GCD of 36 and 48, then estimate the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5.\n\nStarting with the GCD. The math_gcd function requires two positive integers. The user provided 36 and 48, both are positive integers. So I can use the math_gcd function here. The parameters would be a=48 (since the first argument is supposed to be the larger one) and b=36. Wait, the function's Args say a is the first and larger integer. So I need to make sure a is the bigger number. 48 is larger than 36, so a=48 and b=36. That should work.\n\nNext, the derivative estimation. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2. The estimate_derivative function needs a callable function, the x point, dx, and method. The user didn't specify dx or method, so I'll use the defaults. The default dx is 0.001 and method is 'central'. So I need to pass function as a lambda that takes x and returns x squared. In Python, that's lambda x: x**2. The x value is 5. So the parameters for estimate_derivative would be function: lambda x: x**2, x:5, dx:0.001, method:'central'. Since dx and method are optional with defaults, I can omit them in the tool call if the user didn't specify, but the function's default will handle it. But the tool call needs to include the parameters as per the function's definition. Wait, the user's question says \"estimate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point x = 5\". So the parameters are function, x, and optionally dx and method. Since the user didn't mention dx or method, I should use the defaults. So in the tool call, I need to include the function as a lambda, x as 5, and maybe dx and method if needed, but since they are optional, maybe I can omit them. Wait, the function's Args for estimate_derivative have dx and method as optional with defaults. So in the tool call, I can just provide the required parameters. The required parameters are 'function' and 'x'. So the tool call for estimate_derivative would be function: lambda x: x**2, x:5. But how to represent the lambda in the JSON? The user's function is f(x) = x^2, which translates to a lambda in Python as lambda x: x**2. So in the parameters, the 'function' argument should be that lambda. However, JSON can't directly represent a lambda function. Wait, but the tool call is supposed to be in a format that the system can process. Maybe the system expects the function to be passed as a string or some other representation. But looking at the example given in the problem statement, the user provided functions in Python format, and the tool call is supposed to be in JSON with parameters. The example for estimate_derivative shows that the 'function' parameter is any callable, like a lambda. But in JSON, how to represent that? Hmm, maybe the system expects the function to be written as a string, but the user's instruction says to use the parameters as per the function's definition. Wait, the user's instruction says that the assistant should return the function calls in the specified JSON format. So for the 'function' parameter in estimate_derivative, the value would be a lambda expression. But in JSON, functions can't be directly represented. However, the problem statement's example shows that the assistant is supposed to write the parameters as they are. For example, in the given functions, the estimate_derivative's 'function' parameter is described as \"any\": A callable function. So perhaps in the tool call, the assistant is supposed to represent the lambda as a string, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the system is designed to accept Python code snippets as strings. But the user's instruction says to make the function calls in the format of the JSON with parameters. Since the assistant can't execute code, it's possible that the system is designed to handle the function as a string, but the problem statement's example doesn't show that. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example for the tool call, the user is to return the function calls in the JSON format. For example, if the function requires a lambda, how is that represented? The problem statement's example for the estimate_derivative function shows that the 'function' parameter is a callable, like lambda x. So perhaps in the tool call, the assistant is supposed to write the lambda as a string, but the problem statement's example doesn't clarify this. However, given that the user is to return the function calls in the specified JSON format, and the parameters must be provided as per the function's definition, the assistant must represent the lambda function in a way that the system can process. Since the system is using Python functions, perhaps the assistant is to write the lambda as a string, but the problem statement's example doesn't show that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant is to pass the lambda as a Python expression. But in JSON, functions can't be directly represented. This is a bit confusing. However, given the problem statement's instructions, the assistant must proceed as best as possible. So for the estimate_derivative function, the 'function' parameter is a lambda x: x**2. In the tool call, the assistant would need to represent this as a string, perhaps. But the problem statement's example doesn't show this. Alternatively, maybe the system is designed to accept the function as a string, and the actual code is evaluated. For example, the assistant would write the lambda as a string, like \"lambda x: x**2\". But the problem statement's example doesn't show this. However, given that the user is to return the function calls in the JSON format, and the parameters must be provided as per the function's definition, the assistant must proceed. So in the tool call for estimate_derivative, the 'function' parameter would be the lambda function as a string. Therefore, the parameters would be: {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}. But the problem statement's function definition says that the 'function' parameter is a callable, so perhaps the system is designed to accept the string representation and then evaluate it. Therefore, the assistant should represent the lambda as a string in the JSON. So the tool call for estimate_derivative would be: {\"function\": \"estimate_derivative\", \"parameters\": {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}}. However, the problem statement's example for the tool call shows that the parameters are written as JSON objects with the actual values. For example, if the function requires a lambda, how is that handled? The problem statement's example doesn't provide a case where a function is passed as a parameter. Therefore, perhaps the assistant is to represent the lambda as a string, and the system will handle it. So, proceeding with that, the tool call for estimate_derivative would have the function parameter as a string \"lambda x: x**2\", x as 5, and the other parameters as default. Therefore, the two tool calls would be first math_gcd with a=48, b=36, then estimate_derivative with function as the lambda string, x=5. So the final answer would be two tool calls in the specified JSON format."}

The user wants to turn an image by 20 degrees and flip it horizontally. I need to figure out which functions to use here.\n\nFirst, the rotation part. The available functions include rotateImageAction. The parameters for that are degrees, image_format, and keep_original. The user specified 20 degrees, so I'll set degrees to 20. The image_format isn't mentioned, so maybe use the default, which is JPEG. Keep_original is also not specified, so default to True.\n\nNext, the flip horizontally. The flipImageAction function is there. The flip_direction needs to be 'horizontal'. The user didn't mention any other parameters for flipping, so that's the only one needed.\n\nWait, do I need to consider the order? Like, should we rotate first then flip, or the other way around? The user's instruction is to turn it by 20 degrees and flip it horizontally. Typically, such operations might be applied in the order mentioned, but the functions here might handle each step independently. Since each function is a separate action, maybe the order isn't an issue here. Each function will modify the image as per the current state. So first rotate, then flip.\n\nSo the correct function calls would be first rotateImageAction with 20 degrees, then flipImageAction with horizontal direction. The parameters for rotateImageAction: degrees=20, image_format default to JPEG, keep_original default to True. For flipImageAction, flip_direction is 'horizontal'.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted.

The user wants two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon on 2023-05-10 at 15:00.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider for finding a stylist. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so the city is set. They didn't mention unisex, so I'll default is_unisex to 'dontcare'.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is needed. The parameters are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' as the salon name, 15:00 as time, and 2023-05-10 as date. All required parameters are present.\n\nI need to make sure the date formats are correct. The appointment_date is already in 'YYYY-MM-DD', and the time is in 24-hour format. So both are correct. \n\nNo weather function is needed here since the user didn't ask for weather info. \n\nSo first call FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex as 'dontcare'. Then call BookAppointment with the given details. Both functions are necessary here."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThere's a function called get_current_weather. Its parameters are location (string in 'City, State' format) and unit (default Fahrenheit). So I need to call this function twice, once for each city.\n\nFirst, for Boston, MA. The location is provided as \"Boston, MA\", and the unit is Fahrenheit, which is the default, so I don't need to specify it unless the user wants something else. The user did mention \"fahr\" which is shorthand for Fahrenheit, so that's covered.\n\nSecond, for San Francisco. The user wrote \"San Francisco in fahr\". The location should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)'. San Francisco is in CA, so the location parameter should be \"San Francisco, CA\". The unit is again Fahrenheit, so default applies.\n\nI need to make two separate function calls. Each will use get_current_weather with the respective location. The parameters are straightforward. Let me structure the JSON for each function call.\n\nFirst function call: function name get_current_weather, parameters location \"Boston, MA\", unit \"fahrenheit\". Wait, the unit parameter's default is fahrenheit, so maybe it's optional. But the user explicitly mentioned Fahrenheit, so including it is safe.\n\nSecond function call: location \"San Francisco, CA\", unit \"fahrenheit\". \n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. Each function call is an object in a list. So the tool calls would be two entries in the JSON array. Let me double-check the parameters for each. Yes, the locations are correct, and units are specified as fahrenheit. That should cover both requests."}
{"id": "live_parallel_multiple_23-20-0", "result": "<TOOLCALL>```json\n[{\"function\":\"user.mandates\",\"parameters\":{\"name\":\"Parath\",\"status\":\"pending\"}},{\"function\":\"user.mandates\",\"parameters\":{\"name\":\"Parath\",\"status\":\"active\"}},{\"function\":\"user.mandates\",\"parameters\":{\"name\":\"Bhanu\",\"status\":\"pending\"}},{\"function\":\"user.mandates\",\"parameters\":{\"name\":\"Bhanu\",\"status\":\"active\"}}]\n```</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 445, "output_token_count": 658, "latency": 14.877665758132935, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants all pending and active mandates for users Parath and Bhanu. Hmm, the functions available are user.mandates and partner.mandates. \n\nFirst, the user.mandates function takes a name and status. The partner.mandates function takes a status. But the user is asking for two specific users, Parath and Bhanu. So I need to check if these are partners or clients.\n\nWait, the user.mandates is for partners to get their clients' mandates. So if Parath and Bhanu are clients of the partner, then using user.mandates makes sense. The function requires the name of the client and the status. The user wants both pending and active, so I need to call the function for each status for each user.\n\nAlternatively, if Parath and Bhanu are partners, maybe partner.mandates would be used. But the partner.mandates function doesn't take a name parameter, only status. So if they are partners, the partner.mandates function would get their own mandates, not others'. So probably, Parath and Bhanu are clients of the partner, so we should use user.mandates.\n\nSo for each user (Parath and Bhanu), and for each status (pending and active), we need to call user.mandates. But wait, the default status for user.mandates is active. So if we call it with status 'pending' and 'active' for each user, that would cover both.\n\nWait, but the user says \"all pending and active\". So maybe for each user, we need to make two calls: one for pending and one for active. Alternatively, if the API allows multiple statuses in one call, but the function's parameters don't support that. The function's status is a single string. So each status needs a separate call.\n\nTherefore, for Parath, call user.mandates with name 'Parath' and status 'pending', then again with status 'active'. Same for Bhanu. But wait, the default for user.mandates is 'active', so if we call without specifying status, it would get active. But the user wants both pending and active. So for each user, two calls: one for pending and one for active.\n\nSo total four function calls: Parath pending, Parath active, Bhanu pending, Bhanu active.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all mandates that are either pending or active. But the function allows specifying one status at a time. So yes, need to make separate calls for each status for each user.\n\nSo the correct approach is to call user.mandates four times with the respective parameters."}
