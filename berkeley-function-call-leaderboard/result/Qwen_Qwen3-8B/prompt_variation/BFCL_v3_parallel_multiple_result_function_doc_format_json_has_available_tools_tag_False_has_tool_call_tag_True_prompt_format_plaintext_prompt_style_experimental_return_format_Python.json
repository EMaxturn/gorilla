There's 'animal_population.get_history' for historical data and 'animal_population.get_projection' for future projections. \n\nFor the historical data part, the user mentioned two countries (Bangladesh and India) and the crop is tigers. The function requires country, species, and years. So, I'll need to call 'animal_population.get_history' for each country separately. The species is 'tiger', and the years are 5. That's two separate function calls.\n\nNext, for the projection part, the user wants Nepal and Malaysia. The function here is 'animal_population.get_projection', which needs country, species, and years. The species is still 'tiger', and the years are 10.

There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The size is an array of integers. \n\nFor the first sculpture, the museum is Philadelphia, material is marble, and size is [4,4]. The second one is New York, bronze, size [6,3]. Wait, but the user mentioned \"average price\" of both. However, the get_artwork_price function might give the price for each individually. Since the user is asking for the average, I need to get both prices and then calculate the average.\n\nBut wait, the functions provided don't mention anything about average. The get_artwork_price function retrieves the price based on size and material. So I need to call this function twice, once for each sculpture, then compute the average. \n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"average price of a 4ft... and 6ft...\", which might imply they want the average of the two prices. So I need to get each price first. \n\nSo, first call get_artwork_price for Philadelphia, marble, [4,4]. Then call it again for New York, bronze, [6,3]. Then take those two prices and average them. \n\nBut the functions available don't have a way to calculate averages. So the user might be expecting the two prices, but the question says \"average price\". However, the functions can only retrieve individual prices. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the function twice and then compute the average manually. \n\nBut the user's query is a single question. So the assistant needs to make two function calls to get each price, then present the average. However, the system's response is to generate the function calls. So the assistant should make two separate calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture. \n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in the question. The first sculpture is 4x4, the second 6x3. The function requires the size as an array. So for each sculpture, the parameters are:\n\nFirst: museum_location='Philadelphia', sculpture_material='marble', sculpture_size=[4,4]\n\nSecond: museum_location='New York', sculpture_material='bronze', sculpture_size=[6,3]\n\nSo two function calls to get_artwork_price.

The user has three parts to their query, so I need to handle each one with the right function calls.\n\nFirst, they want the total energy produced from 5 moles of glucose. The function calc_energy seems right here. The parameters needed are mols, substance, and optionally joules_per_mol. The problem states 5 moles of glucose, and the default for joules_per_mol is 2800 kJ/mol, which matches the given info. So I'll call calc_energy with mols=5 and substance='C6H12O6'. The default for joules_per_mol is already 2800, so no need to specify it unless it's different, but here it's the same. Wait, the user says \"energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\", so that's the default. So the first call is calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6').\n\nSecond, calculate biomass from the energy produced using 10% efficiency. The calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step will be used here. Since the efficiency is 10%, which is 0.1 in decimal, I'll set efficiency=0.1. But I need to make sure the energy value is passed correctly. So after getting the energy from the first function, the second call would be calc_biomass(energy=energy_value, efficiency=0.1). But since the user hasn't provided the actual energy value yet, the first step is necessary to get that.\n\nThird, calculate work done by the machine using the total energy and distance of 2 meters. The calc_work function requires energy and distance. The energy here is the same as the one from the first step. So once we have the total energy, the third call would be calc_work(energy=energy_value, distance=2).\n\nWait, but the user wants the work done by the machine, which uses the total energy produced by the bacteria. So the third step depends on the first step's output. So the order is: first calculate energy, then biomass, then work. Each subsequent step depends on the previous. So the first function call is calc_energy, then calc_biomass, then calc_work. Each of these functions needs the parameters as specified. The user provided all necessary parameters except for the efficiency in the second step, which is given as 10%, so 0.1. The third step's distance is 2 meters.

The function calc_Compound_Interest needs these, and compound_freq has a default of 1, but maybe it's better to specify it here.\n\nThird option: Future value with initial investment $3000, interest rate 5% (but wait, the function future_value uses interest_rate as a decimal, so 5% would be 0.05), time 6 years, and num_compoundings 2.

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco. The details given are 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985, and location is San Francisco. The predict_house_price function requires area, rooms, year, and location. All these parameters are provided, so I can call that function.\n\nNext, they need information on lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity and county. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, and the county is San Francisco. The state is optional and defaults to California, which is already the case here. So I should call lawsuit_search with entity='John Doe' and county='San Francisco'.\n\nLastly, the probability of winning a lottery with 1000 total outcomes and 5 favorable, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The required parameters are total and favorable, and round_to is optional with a default of 2. Since the user wants 3 decimals, I need to set round_to=3. So call calculate_probability with total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped and that the functions are called in the right order. Let me check each function's required parameters again to confirm. Yes, all required fields are present. Now, structure the tool calls accordingly."}

They have four separate requests, so I need to handle each one with the appropriate function.\n\nFirst, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during Summer. The relevant function here is get_collectables_in_season. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. Since they specified 'fish', I should set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in the Asia region. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. So I'll set those parameters accordingly.\n\nThird, they want details of lawsuits involving Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name and year. The case_type is optional, so I can omit it or set it to default. Since they didn't specify a case type, I'll just include the company and year.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability calculation with 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All these values are provided, so I'll plug them in.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the right parameters. Let me check each one again to ensure I didn't miss any required fields or default values. Everything seems in order. Time to structure the tool calls."}
