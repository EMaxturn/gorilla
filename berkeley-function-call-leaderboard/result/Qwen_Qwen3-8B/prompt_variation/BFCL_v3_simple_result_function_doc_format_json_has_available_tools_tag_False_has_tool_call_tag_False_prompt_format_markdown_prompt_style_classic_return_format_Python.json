The initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, which matches the user's assumption. Gravity has a default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2. Since the user didn't specify any different gravity, I can use the default. So I just need to call the function with height=150 and initial_velocity=0.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each roll of a six-sided die is an independent event. The probability of getting a six on a single roll is 1/6. Since they want two sixes in a row, I need to multiply the probability of each individual event. So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the available functions, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters. The function requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides which defaults to 6. The user specified a six-sided die, so die_sides is 6. The desired_number is 6, and they want it to happen twice. So the parameters would be desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2. Since die_sides is optional and default is 6, I don't need to include it unless specified. Wait, the user did mention a six-sided die, but the default is already 6, so including it might be redundant but correct. However, the function's parameters say die_sides is optional with default 6. So the correct call would be probability.dice_roll with desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2. \n\nWait, does the function handle the calculation correctly? The description says it calculates the probability of rolling the desired number a certain number of times in a row. So yes, passing those parameters should give the right result. Therefore, the function call should be probability.dice_roll(desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2). I don't need to include die_sides since it's the default. But maybe the user explicitly mentioned six-sided, so including it would be better? Wait, the parameters for the function have die_sides as optional with default 6. So even if the user says six-sided, the default is already 6, so it's not necessary. But maybe the function expects it to be specified. Wait, no, the default is 6, so it's okay to omit. So the correct function call is probability.dice_roll(desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2). That should compute (1/6)^2 = 1/36, which is approximately 0.0278 or 2.78% probability."}

The parameters are company (string), start_date (MM-DD-YYYY), location (full state name), and status (enum: ongoing, settled, dismissed). The required fields are company, start_date, location. Status defaults to ongoing.\n\nThe user specified 'ongoing', so I should set status to 'ongoing'. The company is 'Google', location is 'California'. The start_date needs to be after January 1, 2021. The format is MM-DD-YYYY, so January 1, 2021 would be '01-01-2021'. Since the user said 'after', maybe the start_date should be '01-01-2021' and the function might handle it, but sometimes date ranges are inclusive. However, the function's description says 'date range', so perhaps setting start_date to '01-01-2021' and maybe an end_date? Wait, the function parameters don't include end_date. Oh, right, the function only has start_date. So maybe the user wants all lawsuits filed from January 1, 2021 onwards. But the function's start_date is the start of the range. Wait, the description says \"within a specific date range and location\". Wait, the parameters only have start_date, not end_date. That's a bit confusing. Wait, looking back: the parameters for the function are start_date and location. Wait, no, the parameters are company, start_date, location, and status. Wait, the parameters are company, start_date, location, and status. Wait, the 'start_date' is the start of the date range. But the function's description says \"within a specific date range and location\". Wait, but the parameters only have start_date. Maybe the end_date is not a parameter here. That's odd. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and maybe the end date is not specified, so perhaps it's only filtering lawsuits filed on or after the start_date. But the user says \"filed after January 1, 2021\", which would mean start_date should be '01-01-2021' and maybe the end_date is not specified. However, the function doesn't have an end_date parameter. So perhaps the function is intended to search from the start_date onwards. Therefore, setting start_date to '01-01-2021' would capture all lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user said \"after\", which might mean strictly after. However, since the function's parameters don't include an end date, maybe the start_date is inclusive. So the user's query is to search for lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, so the start_date should be '01-01-2021' and the function will return those filed from that date onwards. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to exclude the start date, but without an end date parameter, it's not possible. So the best approach is to set start_date to '01-01-2021' and status to 'ongoing', company as 'Google', location as 'California'. The required parameters are all present. So the function call should be lawsuit_search(company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', status='ongoing')."}

Therefore, I'll proceed with the date as 'next month' and the genre as 'Pop', location as 'New York'. But wait, the function's parameters require the date to be a string. So maybe the user expects the date to be in the format 'YYYY-MM'. But since the user hasn't specified the exact month, perhaps the function can accept 'next month' as a string.

Let me check the available functions. There's get_song_lyrics which requires song_title and artist_name. The parameters are there, song title is \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and artist name is \"Queen\". The lang parameter is optional with a default of English. Since the user didn't specify a language, I'll use the default. So I need to call get_song_lyrics with song_title and artist_name.

They want to identify the potential key signature. The available function is music.theory.chordProgression. Let me check the parameters. The function requires 'progression' as an array of strings, which is provided. The other parameters are optional: returnAllPossibleKeys (default false) and assumeMajor (default true). Since the user didn't specify these, I should use the defaults. So, the function call should include the progression and maybe set assumeMajor to true. Wait, the default for assumeMajor is already true, so maybe it's redundant to include it unless the user wants to change it. But the user's question doesn't mention anything about major or minor, so sticking with the default is safe. Therefore, the correct function call is music.theory.chordProgression with the given progression. No need for other parameters unless specified. The user might be looking for the key, possibly major, based on the default assumption. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The progression is an array, and the function is called with that. So the final call should be as the user wrote, but maybe with the parameters properly structured."}

The location is optional, and the user didn't specify it, so I don't need to include that. I should call the function with the given parameters. Let me make sure the parameters match the required types. Team name is a string, num_of_games is an integer, and league is a string. Everything looks good. No missing parameters.

Start date is March 10, 2023. The preference mentioned is pet-friendly, which is one of the options in the enum. So I should include that in the preferences array. The other parameters like gym, swimming pool, etc., aren't mentioned, so I don't need to add them. The function call should include all required parameters and the specified preference. Let me make sure the dates are in the correct format. The start_date should be a string, probably in YYYY-MM-DD format. March 10th, 2023 would be 2023-03-10.
