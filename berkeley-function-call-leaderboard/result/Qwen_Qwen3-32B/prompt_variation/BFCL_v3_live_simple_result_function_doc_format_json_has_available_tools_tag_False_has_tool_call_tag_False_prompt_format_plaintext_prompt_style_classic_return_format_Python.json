The given function is requests.get, which sends a GET request. The parameters required for this function are 'url' and 'params'. The 'url' should be the base path without query parameters, and 'params' is a dictionary of query parameters.\n\nThe user's parameters include fabricName: Network1, nodeId: 12, podId: 10, interfaceType: Ethernet, infoType: Speed. The function's parameters for the GET request include fabricName (string), nodeId (integer), podId (integer), interfaceType (from enum, which includes 'ethernet'), and infoType (from enum, which includes 'Speed'). \n\nWait, the interfaceType in the function's enum is listed as 'ethernet' (lowercase), but the user provided 'Ethernet' with a capital E. I need to make sure to use the correct enum value. The function's enum for interfaceType is ['gigabitethernet', 'fastethernet', 'ethernet', 'serial'], so 'ethernet' is valid. The user's input is 'Ethernet', but it should be converted to lowercase as per the enum.\n\nSimilarly, the infoType is 'Speed', which matches the enum's 'Speed' (case-sensitive?), but the enum shows 'Speed' as an option, so that's okay.\n\nThe URL should be constructed with the base path. The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example seems a bit off. Let me check again. The example URL in the parameters is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. But the actual URL structure for Cisco Nexus Dashboard might differ. However, the user hasn't provided the exact URL path, so I have to rely on the example given in the function's parameters. The user's API name is \"get information of an interface,\" so perhaps the correct URL path is as per the example. The function's example URL includes {ip}, which should be replaced with the provided IP address 192.120.45.67.\n\nPutting it all together, the URL would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Then, the parameters are fabricName='Network1', nodeId=12, podId=10, interfaceType='ethernet' (lowercase), infoType='Speed'.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The function's 'params' is a dictionary, so the keys are the parameter names, and the values are the provided values. Also, nodeId and podId are integers, which the user provided as 12 and 10, so those are correctly typed. The interfaceType needs to be converted to lowercase 'ethernet' as per the enum. The infoType is 'Speed', which is in the enum as 'Speed', so that's correct.\n\nSo the function call should be requests.get with the constructed URL and the parameters. Let me double-check all parameters and the URL structure. The URL example in the function's parameters includes multiple 'api' segments, which might be a typo, but since that's what's provided, I have to use it as is. The user's version is 6.3.1, but the URL doesn't include a version parameter, so perhaps the example is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is:\n\nrequests.get(url='https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', params={'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'})"}
