First, they want to clone a Git repository from GitHub. The command given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I need to make sure that's correct. The function clone_repo can handle that. So I'll call clone_repo with the repo_url parameter.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the contents of the repo. The function analyse_repo_contents takes the directory_name. The user mentioned analyzing the contents, so I should use that function with the directory name. But wait, the user didn't specify the directory name. Oh, but maybe the directory is the same as the repo's directory. Let me check the steps again. The steps list shows that after cloning, they need to create dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. So maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's directory. But the user hasn't provided that. Hmm, maybe I should assume that the directory is the same as the repo's directory. But the function requires the directory_name. Since the user hasn't specified it, perhaps I need to use a default? Wait, the function's parameters have a default for directory_name as '.'). But the user's steps mention \"the repo\" which might be the same as the directory. Maybe I should use the default, but the user's instruction says to use the steps provided. Wait, the user's steps are: clone, analyse, create dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes, commit. So after cloning, the next step is to analyse the contents. But the directory_name is part of the function's parameters. Since the user hasn't provided the directory name, maybe I need to use the default, which is the current working directory. But the function's default is '.'). However, the user's steps mention \"the repo\" which might be the same as the directory. So perhaps I should use the default directory_name. But the user's instruction says to use the steps provided. So maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's directory. But the function requires it. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's directory. Let me proceed with that.\n\nThen, after analysing, create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. The function create_a_docker_file needs the directory_name. The user's steps mention creating these, so I need to call those functions. Also, the user says to add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit message, branch, and force push. The user hasn't provided the commit message or branch, so maybe those parameters are defaults. But the user's steps mention adding changes, so perhaps the commit message is 'Update changes' and branch is 'main'. The force push is default false. So I can use those defaults.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with the given URL.\n2. Call analyse_repo_contents with the directory_name (assuming it's the same as the repo's directory).\n3. Call create_a_docker_file with the directory_name.\n4. Call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the directory_name, deployment name, image name, replicas, port, service type.\n5. Call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, commit message, branch, force push.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" and \"commit / push to repo\". So after creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, the push step is needed. The parameters for push_git_changes_to_github are directory_name, commit message, branch, force push. Since the user hasn't provided these, I'll use the defaults. So the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, clone_repo with the given URL.\n\nThen, analyse_repo_contents with the directory_name (assuming it's the same as the repo's directory, which is probably the same as the directory_name parameter in the function call).\n\nThen, create_a_docker_file with the directory_name.\n\nThen, create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name, deployment_name (maybe default?), image_name (default?), etc.\n\nFinally, push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, commit message, branch, force push.\n\nBut the user's steps list shows that after cloning, they need to analyse, create dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes, commit. So the order is correct.\n\nSo the final function calls would be:\n\n[\n    {\"function\": \"clone_repo\", \"parameters\": {\"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\", \"deployment_name\": \"my-deployment\", \"image_name\": \"my-image\", \"port\": 80, \"service_type\": \"ClusterIP\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\", \"commit_message\": \"Update changes\", \"branch_name\": \"main\", \"force_push\": false}}\n]\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" and \"commit / push to repo\". So the push step is needed. The parameters for push_git_changes_to_github are directory_name, commit message, branch, force push. The user's default values are set, so I can use those. So the JSON should include those parameters.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check again. The user's steps are:\n\n1. Clone repo.\n\n2. Analyse contents and create dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n3. Add changed files to git.\n\n4. Commit/push.\n\nYes, that's covered. So the function calls are correct."}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The get_relevant_classes function is for finding classes related to a search string, including subdirectories. The user mentioned 'CellResult', so I should use that function with the search string set to 'CellResult'. The case_sensitive parameter is default, so that's fine.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. So I need to call get_signature with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name 'setCellValue', and include_private True. Similarly, another call for 'getCellValue' with include_private True.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found. But the functions provided don't include a function to check for method existence. The get_relevant_classes function might not directly address that. However, the user's question includes that part, so maybe they need to check if those methods exist in the repository. But since the functions available don't have a method to check for method presence, perhaps the user needs to use get_relevant_classes with the search string 'CellResult' and then check the signatures. But according to the functions given, the get_signature function can retrieve the signatures. So the steps are: call get_relevant_classes for 'CellResult', then get_signature for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo the final answer should include two function calls: get_relevant_classes with the search string and include subdirectories, and get_signature twice with the respective parameters."}
