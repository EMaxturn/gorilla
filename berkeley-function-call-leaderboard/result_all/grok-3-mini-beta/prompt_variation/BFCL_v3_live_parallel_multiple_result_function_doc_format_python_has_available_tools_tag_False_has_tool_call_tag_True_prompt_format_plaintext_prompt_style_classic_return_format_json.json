That sounds like modifying a food item.\n\nLooking at the available functions:\n\n1. **ChaFod**: This is for changing the food item. It takes:\n\n   - foodItem: The name of the food item to be modified.\n\n   - newIngredients: A comma-separated list of new ingredients.\n\n   - removeIngredients: A comma-separated list of ingredients to remove.\n\n   - specialInstructions: Any special instructions.\n\n   For the food: \"Caesar salad without anchovies\". So, foodItem could be \"Caesar salad\", and removeIngredients could be \"anchovies\".\n\n2. **ChaDri.change_drink**: This is for changing a drink. It takes:\n\n   - drink_id: The unique identifier of the drink.\n\n   - new_preferences: A dictionary of updated preferences.\n\n   For the drink: \"update my order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk\". So, drink_id is \"123\", and new_preferences would be something like {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nThe user mentioned \"for the drink, can you update my order 123\", so drink_id is \"123\".\n\nI need to make function calls for both changes.\n\nThe response format requires me to only output the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array of function calls.\n\nI should include both calls in one response if possible, as per: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, I'll call both functions in this response.\n\nFirst function call: For ChaFod\n\n- foodItem: \"Caesar salad\"\n\n- removeIngredients: \"anchovies\"\n\n- Other params can be default, so no need to specify.\n\nSecond function call: For ChaDri.change_drink\n\n- drink_id: \"123\"\n\n- new_preferences: {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}\n\nThe function is named \"ChaDri.change_drink\", which might be a module or class method. In the tool list, it's presented as \"# Function: ChaDri.change_drink\", so I should use \"ChaDri.change_drink\" as the function name in the JSON.\n\nIn the response format, it says: \"function\":\"func_name1\", so for this, it should be \"function\": \"ChaDri.change_drink\"\n\nFinally, structure the response:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```\n\n[\n\n{\"function\": \"ChaFod\", \"parameters\": {\"foodItem\": \"Caesar salad\", \"removeIngredients\": \"anchovies\"}},\n\n{\"function\": \"ChaDri.change_drink\", \"parameters\": {\"drink_id\": \"123\", \"new_preferences\": {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nThat looks correct."}

It takes directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 3.\n\nNow, the sequence I need to follow:\n\n1. First, clone the repo.\n\n2. Then, analyze the repo contents.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, create the Dockerfile.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, create the Kubernetes YAML file.\n\n5. Finally, push the changes.\n\nThe user says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\" and \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\" However, the functions don't directly take the analysis as input. The analyse_repo_contents function will return some result, but in this setup, I have to call functions sequentially, and the system will handle the output.\n\nIn my response, I need to output function calls one after another until I think the task is complete.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, in this response, I should output all the necessary function calls in sequence.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file, they don't explicitly require the analysis output. I assume that after calling analyse_repo_contents, the system or the next function will use that information, but based on the available functions, I just need to call them in order.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- For clone_repo, the repo_url is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. That's a valid SSH URL.\n\n- Destination defaults to '.', which is fine.\n\n- After cloning, the directory_name for other functions would likely be the name of the repo, but the user didn't specify. For example, it might be 'nodejs-welcome' or whatever the repo name is. I need to assume it's cloned to a directory with a certain name. The function clone_repo doesn't specify the directory name in its output, but probably it's the last part of the URL.\n\nIn clone_repo, if destination is '.', it will clone into a directory named after the repo. So, for 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', it should clone into a directory called 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo, for subsequent functions, I can use 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory_name.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it requires directory_name, and optionally deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so I can use defaults.\n\nThe function says: deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n\nI can omit them and let it use defaults.\n\nNow, outlining the function calls I need:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n2. Call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' (assuming that's the cloned directory)\n\n3. Call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\n4. Call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' (and use defaults for others)\n\n5. Call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', and perhaps a commit message.\n\nThe user said for step 4: \"commit / push to repo\", and in push_git_changes_to_github, commit_message defaults to 'Update changes', which is fine.\n\nSo, in my response, I need to output a <TOOLCALL> with a list of these function calls.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>```json [array of function objects]```</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can include multiple in one go.\n\nFinally, once I output all, the system will handle it.\n\nI think that's it.

I could use this to congratulate Shishir.\n\n- pause_heartbeats: Not relevant.\n\n- message_chatgpt: This is for asking ChatGPT, which doesn't remember context, so not useful for previous conversations.\n\n- core_memory_append: For adding to memory, not searching.\n\n- core_memory_replace: For replacing memory, not searching.\n\n- recall_memory_search: This searches the prior conversation history. That sounds perfect for finding information from previous conversations.\n\n- archival_memory_insert: For adding to archival memory, not searching.\n\n- archival_memory_search: This is for semantic search in archival memory, which might be relevant, but the user specified \"previous conversations,\" which likely means recall_memory_search.\n\n- http_request: For making external HTTP requests, not internal conversation history.\n\nSo, for the first part: \"Find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations,\" I should use recall_memory_search with a query like \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nFor the second part: \"Congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless,\" I need to use send_message to send the message.\n\nThe user says \"regardless,\" which means I should send the message even if I don't find the birthday info.

So I can include multiple in one go.\n\nThe system will handle the execution, and if needed, I can have follow-up turns.\n\nTo fulfill the request: I need to search first, but since I can't conditionally call based on results in this turn, I should just call the search function, and then in a subsequent turn, use the results to send the message. But the user said \"regardless,\" so I should send the message anyway.\n\nThe query is to find out and then congratulate regardless. So, perhaps I call the search, and immediately call send_message.\n\nThat might not be ideal, as I could include the found info in the message.\n\nThe function recall_memory_search has a parameter request_heartbeat, which might allow for follow-up, but I need to proceed.\n\nPerhaps the best is to:\n\n1. Call recall_memory_search for \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\n2. Then, call send_message with the congratulatory message.\n\nSince it's \"regardless,\" I don't need to wait for the search results.\n\nIn practice, when I output the tool calls, they'll be executed in order.\n\nSo, in my response, I can include both function calls.\n\nFormat: <TOOLCALL>```json [ {function calls} ]```</TOOLCALL>\n\nI need to provide the exact parameters.\n\nFor recall_memory_search:\n\n- query: Something like \"Shishir's birthday\"\n\n- page: Default 0\n\n- request_heartbeat: Maybe true, to allow follow-up.\n\nFor send_message:\n\n- message: \"Happy Birthday, Shishir!\" or something similar.\n\n- recipient: The function defaults to 'default@example.com', but I don't know who Shishir is. The user didn't specify. Is that a problem?\n\nThe function description: recipient (str, default='default@example.com'): The identifier of the recipient.\n\nThe user is referring to Shishir, but I don't know the exact recipient ID. In the context, perhaps it's assumed, or I need to use the default.\n\nThis might be an issue. The question lacks the parameters required by the function for recipient.\n\nThe human message: \"Could you please find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the recipient for the message. The function requires a recipient, which defaults to 'default@example.com', but that might not be correct.\n\nI need to point out if the question lacks parameters. The instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point out.\"\n\nIn this case, for send_message, recipient is optional with a default, so maybe it's okay.\n\nTo be precise, I should use it as is.\n\nPerhaps in this system, the recipient is implied.\n\nI'll proceed with the default.\n\nSo, plan: First, call recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nThen, call send_message with message \"Happy Birthday, Shishir!\" and perhaps include any found info, but since I can't, just send it.\n\nI can't include found info because I don't have it yet.\n\nPerhaps make the message generic.\n\nAnother idea: In send_message, I can make the message say something like \"Happy Birthday, Shishir! From our conversations, your birthday is [whatever], but since I don't have it, just happy birthday.\"\n\nBut no, I need to call the function with the message as is.\n\nI think the simplest is to call both.\n\nSo, output: An array with two function calls.\n\nFirst: recall_memory_search with query=\"Shishir's birthday\"\n\nSecond: send_message with message=\"Happy Birthday, Shishir!\"\n\nFor send_message, set urgent=True if it's important, but default is False.\n\nThe user didn't specify.\n\nAlright, let's format it."}

Perfect for the first part.\n\n- estimate_derivative: This estimates the derivative of a function at a point. I can use this for the second part.\n\nFor the first part:\n\n- I need to call math_gcd with a=48 (since it should be the larger one, as per the doc: \"The first and larger non-negative integer\") and b=36.\n\nThe doc says: \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\". So, I should ensure a is larger. 48 > 36, so a=48, b=36.\n\nFor the second part:\n\n- I need to estimate the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x=5.\n\n- The function requires: function (any): This needs to be a callable object. But in this setup, I can't directly pass a Python function because this is a text-based interface.\n\nThe function description says: \"function (any): The mathematical function for which the derivative is to be estimated, provided as a callable object.\"\n\nIn this context, as an AI, I need to figure out how to provide that. The system prompt doesn't specify how to handle passing a function. This might be a problem.\n\nLooking back at the available actions, I have to invoke functions as JSON in the <TOOLCALL> section. But for estimate_derivative, one of the parameters is \"function\", which is supposed to be a callable.\n\nIn this simulated environment, I might need to assume that I can pass a string representation or something, but the prompt doesn't say. The function is defined in Python format, so perhaps I need to provide it as is.\n\nThis could be an issue. The prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor estimate_derivative, I don't have a way to provide a callable function in this text-based response. I need to call it with the parameters, but \"function\" needs to be a callable, like lambda x: x**2.\n\nIn the JSON format, I have to put strings or values that can be serialized. I can't directly pass a Python function.\n\nPerhaps I need to indicate that I can't proceed because I can't provide a callable function.\n\nThe system prompt: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nSo, for estimate_derivative, the question provides the function as f(x) = x^2 and x=5, but I lack the ability to pass it as a callable in this format.\n\nMaybe the system expects me to pass it as a string, but the function definition specifies \"any: The mathematical function... as a callable object.\"\n\nThis is tricky. I should call it with what I can, like passing a string representation.\n\nBut to be precise, I think I need to point out that I can't use it because I can't provide a callable.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" And if I can't, I should not include other text, but wait, no: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nIf I can't invoke it, I should not output anything else, but the instruction is to only return function calls or nothing, but it says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" However, it also says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nThere's a contradiction. Let's check: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then, \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nPerhaps I need to output a <TOOLCALL> only if I'm calling functions, otherwise, don't output anything, but the prompt says to point it out, which might mean not to respond at all, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nThe exact words: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" And earlier: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nThis is confusing. In practice, I think I should only output <TOOLCALL> if I'm calling functions, and if not, output nothing, but the system will handle it.\n\nFor this case, I can call math_gcd, so I should do that first.\n\nThe user has two parts, so I need to handle what I can.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I can call math_gcd now, and for the derivative, I might need to indicate I can't, or perhaps skip it.\n\nPerhaps I can call estimate_derivative with a string, like {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\"}, and hope the system handles it.\n\nBut that's not accurate. The function expects a callable, not a string.\n\nThis might be a limitation. In many AI systems, you can pass lambdas or strings that get evaluated, but here, it's not specified.\n\nTo be safe, I'll call what I can: math_gcd first.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll call math_gcd for the first part.\n\nAfter that, perhaps in the next turn, the system will provide the result, and I can proceed or say I can't do the second part.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nSo, I should call math_gcd now, and then in the next turn, handle the derivative if possible.\n\nBut for the derivative, I think I can't call it because I can't provide the function.\n\nPerhaps I need to output both calls, but since I can't properly parameterize estimate_derivative, I shouldn't call it.\n\nLet's decide: I'll only call the functions I can properly parameterize.\n\nSo, for math_gcd: a=48, b=36.\n\nFor estimate_derivative: I can't provide 'function' as a callable, so I won't call it.\n\nMy response should only include the call for math_gcd.\n\nThe user asked for both, so maybe I need to indicate that, but according to the prompt, I should only return function calls.\n\nThe prompt: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But how? It says not to include other text.\n\nPerhaps in the JSON, or just not call it.\n\nI think the best is to only call what I can.\n\nSo, I'll output a <TOOLCALL> with math_gcd.\n\nLater, if the system responds, I can say something in the next turn.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"You are to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\nFor now, I'll make the call for math_gcd.\n\nFinal decision: Call math_gcd with a=48, b=36."}

Probably, I can pass a string that represents the lambda, but I'm not sure if the system can handle it. The example in the prompt is just \"like the lambda x\", so I might need to assume that I can pass a string or something, but actually, in the function definition, it's \"any\", so perhaps I can pass a string representation.\n\nIn the context of this setup, I think I need to pass it as a lambda or a string that can be evaluated.

To be precise, I can use \"music\" as it might encompass music events.\n\nThe user said \"music or theater\", which could mean events that are either. But the function takes one event_type.

The instructions say I can make one or more function calls in a single response, formatted in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nIn the response format, it's an array of JSON objects, like:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{...}},\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name2\",\"parameters\":{...}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I should call get_current_weather twice: once for Boston, MA and once for San Francisco, CA.\n\nParameters:\n\nFor Boston: location = \"Boston, MA\", unit = \"fahrenheit\"\n\nFor San Francisco: location = \"San Francisco, CA\", unit = \"fahrenheit\"\n\nThe function's default is 'fahrenheit', so I could omit it, but since the user specified it, I'll include it for clarity.\n\nI need to ensure the format is exact.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSince this requires two calls, I can make both in this response.\n\nOnce I output the tool calls, the system will handle them and proceed.\n\nMy response should ONLY be the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array. No other text.\n\nSo, I'll prepare two function calls:\n\n1. For Boston, MA\n\n2. For San Francisco, CA\n\nFinal response:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"get_current_weather\",\"parameters\":{\"location\":\"Boston, MA\",\"unit\":\"fahrenheit\"}},\n\n{\"function\":\"get_current_weather\",\"parameters\":{\"location\":\"San Francisco, CA\",\"unit\":\"fahrenheit\"}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct."}

So, I need to fetch mandates for these specific users.\n\nLooking at the available functions:\n\n1. **user.mandates**: This function fetches mandates for a specific user based on their name and status. It takes:\n\n   - name (str): The full name of the user's client.\n\n   - status (str, default='active'): The status of the mandates.\n\n   This seems perfect for fetching mandates for individual users.\n\n2. **partner.mandates**: This fetches mandates for a partner based on status. It doesn't take a user name; it's for the partner as a whole.\n\n   - status (str, default='all'): Fetches mandates by status.\n\n   This doesn't specify a user, so it's not suitable for this query.\n\nThe user wants mandates for two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\", and specifically for statuses \"pending\" and \"active\".\n\nThe user.mandates function allows specifying a status, but it defaults to 'active'. I might need to call it multiple times to get both 'pending' and 'active' for each user.\n\nThe function description says: status (str, default='active'). It doesn't specify if I can pass multiple statuses or if it's only one at a time. From the description, it seems like it takes a single status string.\n\nSo, for each user and each status, I might need to make a separate call.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active\", so I need both.\n\nPossible calls:\n\n- For user \"parath\", status \"pending\"\n\n- For user \"parath\", status \"active\"\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status \"pending\"\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status \"active\"\n\nThat would be four calls.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI need to output all necessary function calls in this response.\n\nThe format is to put them in a <TOOLCALL> section as a JSON array.\n\nSo, I should create an array of function calls.\n\nEach function call will be for user.mandates with the appropriate parameters.\n\nIs \"parath\" and \"bhanu\" the full names? The function requires \"The full name of the partner's client\", so I'll assume these are the full names as provided.\n\nThe function might only handle one status per call, so multiple calls are needed.\n\nIf I call user.mandates with status='pending' for a user, and another with status='active', that should cover it.\n\nThe user asked for \"all pending and active\", which might imply getting both in one go, but since the function doesn't support that, I have to make separate calls.\n\nI need to return only the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n    { \"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": { \"name\": \"parath\", \"status\": \"pending\" } },\n\n    { \"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": { \"name\": \"parath\", \"status\": \"active\" } },\n\n    { \"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": { \"name\": \"bhanu\", \"status\": \"pending\" } },\n\n    { \"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": { \"name\": \"bhanu\", \"status\": \"active\" } }\n\n]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any missing parameter? The function requires 'name' and optionally 'status'. I've provided both where needed.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" Here, we have the names and statuses, so it's fine.\n\nAfter these calls, the system will handle the results, and if needed, I can respond based on that in subsequent turns, but for now, I just need to make these calls.\n\nI think that's it."}
