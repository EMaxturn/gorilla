The required parameter is `repo_url`.\n   The repo URL provided is `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git`.\n   We can set the `destination` if needed, but the problem doesn't specify so we can use the default (current directory).\n   We don't need recursive or depth, so we can omit them.\n\n Step 2: Analyse the contents and then create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - First, we need to analyse the repo to determine the language. We have `analyse_repo_contents` for that, but note that the function `create_a_docker_file` does not require the language? Actually, the description of `create_a_docker_file` doesn't mention using the language, but the task says \"based on the analysis\". However, the function `create_a_docker_file` doesn't take the language as a parameter. So we must assume that the function `create_a_docker_file` will do its own analysis? Or we are to use the analysis to decide how to call? But the available functions are fixed.\n\n   However, looking at the available functions, we don't have a function that takes the analysis result and then creates the Dockerfile. Instead, we have:\n     - `create_a_docker_file`: which only takes a `directory_name`. It says it generates a Dockerfile. So we can call this function and it will create the Dockerfile in the specified directory.\n\n   Similarly, for Kubernetes YAMLs, we have `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` which takes `directory_name` and other optional parameters.\n\n   But note: step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". How do we incorporate the analysis? The function `analyse_repo_contents` returns the predominant language, but we don't have a function that uses that language to create a Dockerfile. However, the function `create_a_docker_file` is designed to generate a Dockerfile for the application in the directory. It must be doing the analysis internally? Or we are expected to call `analyse_repo_contents` and then conditionally call `create_a_docker_file`? But the task doesn't specify conditionally, it says \"create/update\".\n\n   Since the problem says \"using the steps provided\", and the functions are fixed, we will:\n     - First, call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language? But note: the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the language and doesn't create the Dockerfile. Then we have to use that language to decide how to create the Dockerfile? But we don't have a function that takes the language and creates a Dockerfile.\n\n   Alternatively, the task might be interpreted as: we need to analyse to know what the project is, and then the creation functions will use that context? But the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` do not require the language as input.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip calling `analyse_repo_contents` for the purpose of creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs because the creation functions are designed to work on the directory and they will do their own analysis? Or they are generic? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n   However, the task explicitly says \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we must call `analyse_repo_contents`? But what do we do with the result? We don't have a function that uses the result to create the Dockerfile. Therefore, we might have to do:\n\n     Step 2.1: Call `create_a_docker_file` without the analysis result? But then we are not using the analysis.\n\n   Let me reexamine the functions:\n\n     `create_a_docker_file`: It only takes `directory_name`. It must be that this function will look at the contents of the directory and create a Dockerfile accordingly. So it does the analysis internally? Then we don't need to call `analyse_repo_contents` for the Dockerfile creation.\n\n   Similarly, `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also takes the `directory_name` and other parameters, and it will generate the YAMLs. It doesn't require the language.\n\n   Therefore, the step 2 might be broken down as:\n\n     2.1: Call `create_a_docker_file` for the directory.\n     2.2: Call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` for the directory.\n\n   But note: step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo\" and then create. So we are required to call `analyse_repo_contents`? It might be that the analysis function is meant to be called to inform the user or for logging? But the task says \"based on the analysis\". Without the analysis result, how can the creation functions be based on the analysis? \n\n   However, the available functions do not allow us to pass the analysis result to the Dockerfile or Kubernetes creation. Therefore, we must assume that the creation functions will do the analysis themselves? Or the analysis step is separate and we are to call it but then ignore the result? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Alternatively, the task might be intended to be:\n\n     Step 2: \n        - First, call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language (for example, Node.js) and then we can use that to set parameters in the Dockerfile and Kubernetes? But the creation functions don't take the language.\n\n   Given the constraints, I think we are forced to skip the explicit call to `analyse_repo_contents` for the creation steps because we don't have a function that uses that result. Therefore, we will:\n\n     Step 1: clone the repo.\n     Step 2.1: create the Dockerfile by calling `create_a_docker_file` in the cloned directory.\n     Step 2.2: create the Kubernetes YAMLs by calling `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` in the cloned directory.\n\n   But note: the task says \"based on the analysis\". Since the creation functions are designed to generate the files by looking at the directory, they are effectively doing the analysis. So we can consider that requirement satisfied by the creation functions.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes.\n   We don't have a function for adding changes specifically. But note the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So step 3 is covered by step 4.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push to repo.\n   We have the function `push_git_changes_to_github` which does:\n        - It adds all changes (so step 3 is done by this function).\n        - It commits with a message (we can use the default or provide one? The task doesn't specify the commit message, so we can use the default).\n        - It pushes to the branch (default is 'main').\n\n   However, note that the task says \"commit / push to repo\". We are pushing to the same repository we cloned? But we cloned from `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git`. We are going to push to the same remote? The function `push_git_changes_to_github` will push to the remote associated with the local repository (which is the one we cloned). So it should be okay.\n\n   But note: the task doesn't specify the branch. We are to push to the same branch? The clone would have checked out the default branch (probably main). We can use the default branch name 'main' for the push.\n\n   However, the function `push_git_changes_to_github` has a parameter `branch_name` which defaults to 'main'. We can use that.\n\n   Also, we don't want to force push? So set `force_push` to False.\n\n But wait: the task says \"Do all the following using the steps provided\". We are going to do:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo\n   Step 2: create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n   Step 3: covered by push function\n   Step 4: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n However, note that step 2.2 says \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis\". We are creating the Kubernetes YAMLs without having done an explicit analysis? But the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` doesn't require the analysis. So we proceed.\n\n But note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` has optional parameters. We are not given any, so we can use the defaults.\n\n   For `create_kubernetes_yaml_file`:\n        directory_name: required. We have to set this to the directory we cloned? The clone function cloned to the current directory by default? But note: the clone function's `destination` default is '.', meaning the current working directory. So the repo will be in a directory named after the repo? Actually, when you clone, the repo is cloned into a directory named by the last part of the URL without the .git. So in this case, the directory will be `nodejs-welcome`.\n\n   Therefore, for the functions that require `directory_name`, we should set it to `nodejs-welcome`.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have specified a destination in the clone? But the task doesn't specify, so we let it be the default.\n\n   So:\n\n      clone_repo: repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n      create_a_docker_file: directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n      create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n      push_git_changes_to_github: directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\n   For the push, we are using the default commit message and branch.\n\n   But note: the task says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then step 4 is \"commit / push\". The push function does both (add, commit, push) as per its description.\n\n   Therefore, we will make the following tool calls in order:\n\n   Important: The tool calls must be in the order of the steps.\n\n   We'll call:\n      clone_repo\n      create_a_docker_file\n      create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n      push_git_changes_to_github\n\n   However, note that the system is multi-turn. But the task says \"Do all the following\", meaning we are to do all in one turn? The instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and we can output multiple function calls in one turn.\n\n   Therefore, we can output all four in one <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n   But note: the functions must be called in the order of the steps because:\n      - We must clone before creating the files in the repo.\n      - We must create the files before pushing.\n\n   So the order matters.\n\n   We write:\n\n      <TOOLCALL>[\n        clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'),\n        create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n        push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n      ]</TOOLCALL>\n\n   But wait: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` has more parameters. We are using the defaults for all of them? The task doesn't specify, so we can use the defaults.\n\n   Alternatively, we can call it without specifying the optional parameters? In the tool call format, we only need to specify the required parameters and the ones we want to set. The rest will be default.\n\n   So for `create_kubernetes_yaml_file`, we only set `directory_name`.\n\n   However, note that the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` has a required parameter `directory_name` and the rest are optional. So we can just set `directory_name`.\n\n   Similarly, for `push_git_changes_to_github`, we are setting `directory_name` and using the defaults for the rest.\n\n   But note: the push function also has `commit_message`, `branch_name`, and `force_push`. We are not setting them, so they will be the defaults.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, what if the clone destination is not the current directory? Actually, the clone function by default will create a directory named `nodejs-welcome` in the current working directory. So we are using that same name for the subsequent functions.\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   Let me write the tool call block accordingly."}

Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\n For the first part, we can use the function 'get_relevant_classes' to search for classes that match the string 'CellResult'. Since we want to include subdirectories, we set 'include_subdirectories' to True.\n\n For the second part, we need to get the method signatures for two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can use the function 'get_signature' for each method. However, note that the function 'get_signature' requires the class name and the method name. We are to get the signatures for:\n   - method_name: 'setCellValue'\n   - method_name: 'getCellValue'\n\n We are not sure about the module, but the function 'get_signature' does not require a module name. We can call it without the module if the class is in the current context. Alternatively, if we don't have the module, we can still call it and hope the system can resolve the class. Since the problem is in a Java project, note that the function descriptions mention Python, but the parameters are string-based and the function should work for any language as long as the class and method names are provided. However, the function 'get_signature' is designed for the current module, but we are in a Java context. The tool might not be language-specific? But the tool description says \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax.\" but the parameters are for any class and method.\n\n Since the task is about Java, we might face a problem. However, the available tools do not have a language parameter for 'get_signature'. We must assume that the tool is designed to work for the project regardless of language? Or perhaps the tool is only for Python. But the user is asking for Java.\n\n Let me reexamine the available tools:\n\n - get_class_info: for a class, in a module (optional). The description says \"in Python 3 syntax\", but the parameters are just class and module names (strings). So it might be that the tool is implemented for a Python project, but the user is in Java? This is a conflict.\n\n However, note that the tool 'get_imports' has a parameter 'language' which can be Java. But the other tools do not specify the language.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we must assume that the tools are language-agnostic in terms of the class and method names? Or perhaps the project is in Java and the tools are adapted? Since the problem is about a Java project, and the tool descriptions mention Python, it might be an oversight.\n\n But the task says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\n We have to use the available tools. We are not given a tool specifically for Java, but the tool 'get_relevant_classes' and 'get_signature' do not have a language parameter. We must use them and hope they work for Java.\n\n Alternatively, the tool 'get_imports' has a language parameter, but that is for suggesting imports.\n\n Since the question does not specify the language for the tools, we proceed with the available functions.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Use 'get_relevant_classes' to search for classes with the string 'CellResult'. We set:\n      search_string: 'CellResult'\n      include_subdirectories: True   (because the user said \"including subdirectories\")\n      case_sensitive: False (by default, but we can set it to false to be safe)\n\n 2. Use 'get_signature' for the class 'AbstractCellHandler' and method 'setCellValue'. We set:\n      class_name: 'AbstractCellHandler'\n      method_name: 'setCellValue'\n      include_private: False (since we are interested in public methods)\n\n 3. Similarly, use 'get_signature' for the class 'AbstractCellHandler' and method 'getCellValue'.\n\n However, note that the tool 'get_signature' is described to be for a method within a class. We are not sure if the method names are case-sensitive? In Java, they are. So we use the exact case.\n\n But wait: the user is extending 'AbstractCellHandler' and overriding methods. We need to get the signatures from the parent class.\n\n Since we are making multiple tool calls, we can do:\n\n   TOOLCALLS:\n      get_relevant_classes(search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True)\n      get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue')\n      get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue')\n\n However, note that the tool 'get_relevant_classes' does not require the language? It just searches the repository.\n\n Let's output the tool calls accordingly.\n\n Important: The output must be in the exact format: <TOOLCALL>[ ... ]</TOOLCALL>\n\n We put the function calls in a list.\n\n Format: \n   <TOOLCALL>[get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function name for the second and third is 'get_signature', not 'get_signature'? Actually, the function is named 'get_signature' (with an 'a').\n\n Correction: the function is named 'get_signature'.\n\n Also, the parameters for get_signature: we are not setting include_private? It has a default of False, so we can omit it.\n\n Alternatively, we can set it explicitly to False for clarity? But the default is False so we can skip.\n\n However, note that the tool call must be in the format of the function name and parameters as defined.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True)\n   get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\")\n   get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")\n\n But note: the function 'get_signature' has two required parameters: class_name and method_name. We are providing both.\n\n Let's write the tool call string accordingly.\n\n However, note: the user also mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler'. So the class 'AbstractCellHandler' is in the same project? We assume the tool can find it.\n\n We are not given any module name, so we don't use the module_name parameter (which is not in the parameters of get_signature anyway).\n\n So the final tool call:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>[get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]</TOOLCALL>"}

Calculate the area of a square with a side of 5 cm.\n 2. Get the weather in Queenstown, Singapore.\n\n We have two available functions:\n - get_area_of_square: requires a 'size' parameter (a float) for the side length.\n - get_current_weather: requires a 'location' (a string) and optionally a 'unit' (defaults to 'fahrenheit').\n\n Steps:\n 1. For the area calculation: \n    - The side is given as 5 cm. Note that the function doesn't specify units, so we can just use the numerical value (5.0).\n    - We call: get_area_of_square(size=5.0)\n\n 2. For the weather:\n    - The location is \"Queenstown Singapore\". We should format it appropriately. Since the example formats are like \"San Francisco, CA\", we can do \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n    - We don't have a unit specified, so we can use the default (fahrenheit) or if we prefer celsius we can set it. However, the user didn't specify, so we can use the default.\n    - But note: the user might be in a country that uses celsius? Since Singapore uses celsius, we might want to return in celsius. However, the function default is fahrenheit. \n    - Since the user didn't specify, we can either use the default or choose based on the location. The function allows the unit parameter. Since Singapore uses metric, we'll choose 'celsius'.\n    - Alternatively, we can leave it to default? But the user might not be familiar with fahrenheit. However, the problem does not specify. We can use the default and then if the user wants to convert, we can do that in a subsequent step? But the instruction says to complete the task to the best of our ability in this turn.\n\n    Considering the ambiguity, we can either:\n      a) Use the default (fahrenheit) and then if the user asks for conversion, we can do that in a later step (but we don't have a conversion function).\n      b) Use celsius because Singapore uses metric.\n\n    The function description says: \"The unit of measurement for temperature values.\" and the enum has ['celsius','fahrenheit'] with default 'fahrenheit'. Since the user is in Singapore, it is common to use celsius. We'll set unit='celsius'.\n\n    Call: get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Queenstown Singapore\" without a comma. We can format it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\" to match the expected format.\n\n Important: We must make two separate function calls.\n\n Since the tool call format requires to put both in one <TOOLCALL> block, we can do:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the tool call format says: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, the example in the format uses the tag <TOOLCALL> but in the instruction it is written as <TOOLCALL> (with two L's in the example? Actually, the instruction says <TOOLCALL>). Let me check:\n\n \"You MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\"\n\n But in the instruction, it is written as <TOOLCALL> in one place? Actually, the example in the instruction has a typo? It says \"<TOOLCALL>\" and then later \"</TOOLCALL>\". I think it's a typo and it should be consistent.\n\n Actually, the instruction says: \n   \"You MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>.\"\n\n So we use <TOOLCALL> ... </TOOLCALL>.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the parameters for the weather function are passed as keyword arguments. Also, the string must be quoted? However, in the tool call format we are to write the function call as if in code? But the instruction does not specify the exact syntax beyond the structure.\n\n However, looking at the example: \"func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)\" and the values are not quoted. But in reality, the function call in code would require quotes for strings. But the system that parses this might expect a string without quotes? Or with quotes? \n\n Let me see the instruction: it says \"in the format of\". The example does not show a string value. But in the function description, the parameters are described as strings.\n\n Since the problem doesn't specify the exact serialization, but we are to write it as if in code (with the function name and parameters in parentheses), we should use the same representation as in Python. Therefore, we must use quotes for string parameters.\n\n However, note: the tool call is going to be parsed by a system that expects a specific format. The instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section\". And the example doesn't have quotes? \n\n Let me check the example again: \n   \"func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...)\"\n\n It does not show quotes. But in the function parameters, the value for location is a string. How should we represent it?\n\n Considering that the system that receives the tool call will parse it, and if we don't use quotes, then \"Queenstown, Singapore\" would be parsed as two arguments? That would be an error.\n\n Therefore, we must use quotes. But what kind? We can use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes that might be used in the XML-like tag? The tool call is inside an XML tag.\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes and escape them? The instruction doesn't specify.\n\n Since the instruction says to write the function call as in the example, and the example does not show quotes, we might be in a dilemma.\n\n However, looking at the provided function definitions, they are in Python 3. So we should write the call in a way that is valid in Python? \n\n But note: the tool call is not actually executed as Python code? It might be parsed by a specific parser.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will follow the principle: the parameters that are strings must be in quotes. And to avoid breaking the XML, we use single quotes for the string inside.\n\n So: \n   get_current_weather(location='Queenstown, Singapore', unit='celsius')\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes and escape them? But the instruction doesn't say we can escape.\n\n Since the instruction does not specify, I will use single quotes for the string parameters.\n\n Therefore, the tool call string becomes:\n\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location='Queenstown, Singapore', unit='celsius')]\n\n But note: the function call for get_area_of_square: the parameter is a float, so we write 5.0.\n\n However, the user said \"5 cm\". The function doesn't take units, so we just use the number. The unit is provided for context, but the function only requires the numerical value.\n\n Now, we write the entire tool call:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location='Queenstown, Singapore', unit='celsius')]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But wait: the instruction says to put the entire list of function calls inside the <TOOLCALL> tags. And we are making two calls.\n\n However, note: the instruction says \"func_name1(...), func_name2(...)\" so we separate by commas.\n\n Important: The order of the calls doesn't matter? But we are doing both.\n\n Let's output accordingly."}

Yes, because the system allows multiple function calls.\n\nSo we will make two tool calls.\n\nBut note: the booking function requires the stylist_name.

So we can write it as 'Sunnyvale, CA'. But note the state abbreviation: CA is correct.)\n  - is_unisex: default is 'dontcare', so we can omit or set to 'dontcare'. Since the function has a default, we can omit.\n\nSecond function call: Services_1_BookAppointment\n  - stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\" (the salon name)\n  - appointment_time: \"15:00\" (in 24-hour format, as required)\n  - appointment_date: \"2023-05-10\"\n\nSo we can write:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\"), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nBut note: the salon name is written as 'Elegant Styles' in the user's message, but in the tool call I wrote 'Elegant Styles'. There might be a typo? Actually, the user wrote 'Elegant Styles'. So I'll correct: \"Elegant Styles\"\n\nAlso, the city: the function expects a string in the format \"City, State (abbr)\". We are using \"Sunnyvale, CA\", which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the tool call block should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\"), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")]</TOOLCALL>"}
