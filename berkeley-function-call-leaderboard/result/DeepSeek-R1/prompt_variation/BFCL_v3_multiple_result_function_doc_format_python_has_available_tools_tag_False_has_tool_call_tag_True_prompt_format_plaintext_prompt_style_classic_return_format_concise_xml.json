But the parameter is of type string? We can omit it? But in the tool call, we must specify parameters by name. How do we omit? Actually, the function says the default is for upcoming events. So we can omit the `month` parameter? But the tool call requires that we only pass the parameters we have. Since the function allows default, we can skip it.\n\n   user_ratings: we leave it as default? But the default is 'high'. So we can skip? But note: the task says \"top rated\", so we want high. So we can skip.\n\n However, the function has an optional parameter `month`. We are not forced to set it. But in the tool call, we are allowed to skip optional parameters? The problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the function has optional parameters. So we can skip them.\n\n But note: the task says \"upcoming month\". The function's default is to return upcoming events. That includes the upcoming month? We assume yes.\n\n Therefore, we can call:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n However, note: the function might return multiple. But we are asked for the top rated. We are not told to return multiple, so we assume the function returns the top one? Or a list? But we are only allowed to call the function and then the system will process. We cannot do more than one call? Actually, we can do multiple calls in one tool call? But the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and we can have multiple function tags inside <functions>. But in this case, we are only calling one function.\n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` returns exhibitions. We are not guaranteed that the first one is the top. But the function's purpose is to return the most popular. So we assume the results are ordered by popularity (or rating) and we can take the first one as the top? But the user wants the top rated. So we are going to get a list of exhibitions that are high rated? And we don't know which one is the top? \n\n Since we cannot do further processing (we are only allowed to call functions), we must rely on the function to return the top one? Or we can note that we are returning the list and the user will see the first one? But the task says \"the top rated\", meaning one? \n\n Let's assume that the function `find_exhibition` returns the exhibitions in descending order of rating. Then the first one is the top. So we can just call and then the first result is the answer.\n\n But note: the function might return more than one. We are not told how many. So if we want exactly the top one, we have to hope the function returns the top one first? Or we can set a parameter? There is no parameter to limit the number.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function and then if we get multiple, we cannot process. So we must rely on the function to return the top one? \n\n Given the constraints, we call the function and return the first result? But we cannot, because we are only making the call. The system will then show the results. So we just make the call.\n\n However, the task says \"Find the top rated\". We are making a call that returns a list of high-rated exhibitions. We are not returning the top one. But note: the function is designed to return the most popular, so we assume the first is the top.\n\n Therefore, we call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But note: the art form is specified as \"sculpture\", but the user said \"modern sculpture\". We are not capturing \"modern\". We have two options:\n\n   1. Hope that the exhibitions returned are modern? But we don't know.\n   2. There is another function? We have `get_sculpture_info` but that is for a specific artist and artwork, not for exhibitions.\n\n How can we capture \"modern\"? The function `find_exhibition` doesn't have a style or period parameter. So we cannot. Therefore, we have to return what we get and hope that the user understands that we are returning sculpture exhibitions and that the top rated one might be modern? Or we can try to adjust the art_form string to include \"modern sculpture\"? Let's see the function's art_form: it's a string. We can try to set art_form as \"modern sculpture\". But the function might not support that? We don't know. We can try.\n\n Alternatively, we can leave it as \"sculpture\" and then in the results, we might get a mix. But the user wants modern. \n\n Since we have no way to specify modern in the function, we have to go with \"sculpture\". We can only hope that the system returns modern ones? Or we can note that the function might filter by art_form and modern is not a form? It's a style. So we might not get what we want. But we have no other function.\n\n Therefore, we call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But note: the function `find_exhibition` returns exhibitions. We are not getting the sculpture details. We are getting the exhibition. So the exhibition might be about modern sculpture? We hope.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: maybe we can get the exhibition and then for that exhibition, we might get the sculptures and then check if they are modern? But we don't have a function for that.\n\n Given the available functions, we can only do the above.\n\n But wait: the function `find_exhibition` has a parameter `art_form` which we set to \"sculpture\". We can try to set it to \"modern sculpture\"? Let's try that? Because the function might accept a string and we can put any string? It might match if the exhibition is tagged with that.\n\n So we can set art_form to \"modern sculpture\"? \n\n However, the function description says: \"art_form (str): The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" So it's a form. And \"modern\" is a style, not a form. So it might not work. But we have no alternative.\n\n We decide to set art_form to \"sculpture\" and hope that the top exhibition is modern? Or we set it to \"modern sculpture\" and hope that the system can interpret it? We don't know. \n\n Since the function does not specify the exact string values, we can try:\n\n   Option 1: \"sculpture\" -> might return any sculpture exhibition (including modern and non-modern)\n   Option 2: \"modern sculpture\" -> might return none if the system doesn't have such a tag? \n\n We want the top rated modern sculpture. So we want to filter by modern. We have no other way.\n\n Therefore, we try to use \"modern sculpture\" for the art_form. If the function supports it, we get the desired. Otherwise, we might get nothing? But the task requires an answer. We have to try.\n\n Alternatively, we can call with \"sculpture\" and then the user can see the list and pick the modern one? But we are to find the top rated modern. We cannot do that in one call.\n\n Considering the above, we decide to call with art_form=\"sculpture\", and then we are returning the top rated (which might be modern). We hope that the top rated sculpture exhibition in New York in the upcoming month is modern? Or we can note that the function might not return modern? \n\n Since we are constrained by the available functions, we do:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But note: the user might be disappointed if it's not modern.\n\n Alternatively, we can call with art_form=\"modern sculpture\", and if we get nothing, then we try without? But we cannot make two calls in one turn? The problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" So we can make multiple function calls? But note: the tool call format allows multiple <function> tags inside <functions>. So we can do two calls? \n\n However, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So we can do multiple function calls in one turn? \n\n Let me see: the example format has multiple function tags. So we can do:\n\n   First call: with art_form=\"modern sculpture\"\n   If that returns nothing, then we do a second call with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then we try to find a modern one? But we cannot do conditional calls? We are only outputting the function calls without seeing the result? The system will execute the calls and then we see the result in the next turn? \n\n Actually, we are in one turn and we can output multiple function calls? But the system will execute them in order? And then we can see the results? But we are only allowed to output the function calls and then the system will run them and then the next turn we can see the results? \n\n But the problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" and \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\n So in one turn, we can output multiple function calls? But we don't have the result of the first call to conditionally make the second? We have to output all the function calls we want to make at once? \n\n How can we do two calls? We can do:\n\n   Call 1: find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")\n   Call 2: find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But then we get two lists? And then we have to combine? But we cannot process. So we cannot.\n\n Alternatively, we can only do one call. We have to choose.\n\n Since we are not sure if \"modern sculpture\" is a valid art_form, we might get nothing. So we do:\n\n   Call 1: with art_form=\"sculpture\"\n\n and hope that the top one is modern? Or we do:\n\n   Call 1: with art_form=\"modern sculpture\"\n\n and if we get nothing, then we have to do nothing? \n\n We decide: we are going to call with art_form=\"sculpture\", because that is a known form. And then we hope that the top exhibition is modern? Or we can look at the description? But we cannot because we don't have a function to process the description.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But note: the user might want modern. We are not fulfilling that. \n\n Alternatively, we can call `find_exhibition` without art_form? But then we get any art form? We don't want that.\n\n We have to stick with \"sculpture\".\n\n Alternatively, we can try to get the exhibition and then use another function? But the other function is `get_sculpture_info` which requires an artist name. We don't have an artist name. We have an exhibition? We don't know the artist.\n\n So we cannot.\n\n Therefore, we make one call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But note: we are not specifying the style. We hope the top one is modern.\n\n However, the task says \"modern\". We must try to capture that. \n\n Another idea: maybe we can set the art_form to \"sculpture\" and then in the user_ratings we set to 'high' and then we get the top, and then we hope that the exhibition's title or description includes \"modern\"? But we cannot do that because we don't have a function to look into the description.\n\n So we decide to make the call with art_form=\"sculpture\". We'll note that we are not capturing \"modern\", but that's the best we can do.\n\n But wait: the function `find_exhibition` might have an art_form that includes style? We don't know. So we can try both? We cannot.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n        <functions>\n            <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n                <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n                <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">sculpture</param>\n            </function>\n        </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the user said \"upcoming month\", which is covered by the default of the function.\n\n However, the function has a parameter `user_ratings` which we are leaving as default. We can explicitly set it to 'high'? But the default is 'high'. So we can skip.\n\n But if we want to be explicit, we can set it? The function allows it. But we don't have to. We can set:\n\n   <param name=\"user_ratings\" type=\"string\">high</param>\n\n But that is the same as default. So we skip.\n\n Alternatively, we can set it to make sure? But the function's default is high. So it's redundant.\n\n We decide to skip.\n\n Therefore, the call is:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")\n\n But note: the function has an optional `month` parameter. We are not setting it because the default is upcoming events, which includes the upcoming month? We assume so.\n\n However, if we want to be precise, we can set the month? But we don't know the exact month? The user said \"upcoming month\". We don't know which month that is. So we leave it to the function's default.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n        <functions>\n            <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n                <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n                <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">sculpture</param>\n            </function>\n        </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function `find_exhibition` also has an optional `month` and `user_ratings`. We are not setting them because we are using the defaults and we don't have specific values.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the function does not require these parameters (they are optional). So we are okay.\n\n But note: the function requires `location` and `art_form`? Actually, the function signature:\n\n   find_exhibition(location, art_form, month, user_ratings)\n\n The first two are required? The function description doesn't say they are optional. The function says:\n\n   Args:\n        location (str): The city where the exhibition is held, e.g., New York, NY.\n        art_form (str): The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\n        month (str): ... Default value ...\n        user_ratings (str): ... Default ...\n\n So `location` and `art_form` are required? They don't have a default. So we must provide them.\n\n We are providing them.\n\n Therefore, the call is complete.\n\n Let's write the tool call accordingly.\n\n Important: the type of the parameters is string.\n\n We write:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n        <functions>\n            <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n                <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n                <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">sculpture</param>\n            </function>\n        </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function might return multiple exhibitions. We are only interested in the top rated. We are assuming the first result is the top. We cannot do more.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function returns the most popular, so we are getting the top ones? And the first is the top? We hope.\n\n We output the above.\n\n However, what if the function returns an empty list? Then we have no result. But we have done our best.\n\n Therefore, we output the tool call as above."}
