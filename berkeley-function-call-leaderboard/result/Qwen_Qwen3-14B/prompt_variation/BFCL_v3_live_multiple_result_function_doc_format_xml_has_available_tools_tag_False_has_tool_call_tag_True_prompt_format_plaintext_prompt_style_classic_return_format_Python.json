The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help. The BankStatementOverView function seems right for the overview. It requires bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided most of these: bank is U.S. Bank, account number is given, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview is a summary, which might come from another function.\n\nBut the user also mentioned total deposits, withdrawals, and balances. The TotalTransactions.calculate function could compute those, but the user already provided the totals. However, the transaction_summary.generate function might be needed to generate the detailed summary. Wait, the user wants a summary of transactions, which includes individual transactions and totals. But the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, only the totals. \n\nWait, the user might need the BankStatementOverView to be filled with the transaction overview. But the transaction_overview parameter is a dict. Maybe the TotalTransactions.calculate can generate the totals, but the user already has those numbers. Alternatively, maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve all transactions for the period, but the user hasn't provided the parameters for that. The Alltransactions function needs a statement_period in 'YYYY-MM' format. The user's period is October 2019, so '2019-10'. But the user hasn't specified if they want pending transactions included. However, the user might not have that data, so maybe the assistant can't call that function without more info. \n\nAlternatively, since the user provided total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, maybe the TotalTransactions.calculate function can be used to calculate those, but the user already has those numbers. However, the BankStatementOverView requires a transaction_overview, which is a summary. The transaction_summary.generate function might generate that summary, but it requires a list of transactions, which the user hasn't provided. \n\nWait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the assistant can't generate a detailed transaction summary without that data. But the user might be expecting the assistant to use the provided totals to create a summary. However, the functions available might not allow that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the BankStatementOverView function with the given totals as the transaction overview. But the transaction_overview is a dict, which might include counts and totals. The user provided total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. So maybe the assistant can construct that dict. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided details, including the transaction_overview as a dict with the totals and counts. But how to get the counts? The user hasn't provided the number of transactions. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can't generate the transaction overview without the actual transactions. But the user hasn't provided them. So perhaps the assistant can't fulfill the request fully. However, the user might be expecting the assistant to use the given totals to create a summary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to compute the totals, but the user already provided them. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the functions again. \n\nThe BankStatementOverView requires a transaction_overview as a dict. The user hasn't provided individual transactions, but they have total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. Maybe the transaction_overview can be a summary of those totals. For example, the dict could include total_deposits, total_withdrawals, number_of_transactions (but the user didn't provide that), etc. However, the user hasn't given the number of transactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can't generate the transaction overview without the actual transactions, so the answer would be that the necessary data is missing. But the user might have expected the assistant to use the provided totals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call the BankStatementOverView function with the given data, even if the transaction_overview is incomplete. But that might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might need to call the Alltransactions function to get the list of transactions for the period, then use that to generate the summary. But the user hasn't provided the parameters for Alltransactions, like include_pending. However, the user might not have that info, so the assistant can assume a default. \n\nWait, the Alltransactions function requires the statement_period as 'YYYY-MM', which the user has (2019-10). The include_pending is optional, so the assistant can set it to False unless specified. \n\nSo, the assistant could first call Alltransactions with statement_period '2019-10' and include_pending=False to get the list of transactions. Then, use that list to generate the transaction summary with transaction_summary.generate. Then, use that summary in BankStatementOverView. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the assistant would need to call Alltransactions to retrieve them. However, the user's question is to provide the overview, which includes the transaction summary. So the assistant would need to make multiple function calls. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the necessary parameters for Alltransactions? Wait, the user provided the statement period as October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The statement_period for Alltransactions is 'YYYY-MM', so '2019-10' is correct. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call Alltransactions with statement_period '2019-10' and include_pending=False to get the list of transactions.\n\n2. Use that list to call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions, dates, totals, and customer info.\n\n3. Then, use the generated summary in BankStatementOverView.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the customer's first and last name, which are required for transaction_summary.generate. The user provided the account name as SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, but the function requires firstname, lastname, and optionally middlename and company_name. \n\nWait, the user's account is under the name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which might be the company name. But the transaction_summary.generate requires the customer's first and last name. The user hasn't provided those. So the assistant can't call transaction_summary.generate without that info. \n\nThis is a problem. The user hasn't given the customer's name, which is required for the transaction_summary.generate function. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed with that function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the collect_customer_names function can be used to get the customer's name, but the user hasn't provided the first, middle, or last name. The collect_customer_names function requires firstname and lastname. The user hasn't provided those. \n\nSo, the assistant is missing the customer's name, which is required for the transaction_summary.generate function. Therefore, the assistant can't generate the summary without that information. \n\nBut the user might have expected that the account name is the company name, and maybe the customer's name is part of that. However, the account name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which is likely the company name, not the customer's name. \n\nTherefore, the assistant can't proceed without the customer's first and last name. \n\nBut the user's question is to provide the overview, which includes the transaction summary. Since the necessary parameters are missing (customer's name), the assistant can't fulfill the request. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call BankStatementOverView without the transaction_overview, but that's required. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. The assistant can't generate the required functions without the customer's name and the individual transactions. \n\nWait, the user might have provided the company name as SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The collect_customer_names function requires firstname and lastname. If the user hasn't provided those, the assistant can't call that function. \n\nTherefore, the assistant can't proceed with the transaction_summary.generate function. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the necessary parameters are missing: the customer's first and last name, and the individual transactions. \n\nBut the user might have intended that the account name is the company name, and maybe the customer's name is not needed. However, the transaction_summary.generate function requires the customer's name. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant can't fulfill the request because the required parameters (customer's name and individual transactions) are missing."}

The available functions are FindRestaurants, ReserveRestaurant, and GetRide. Since the user is looking to search for restaurants, FindRestaurants is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for FindRestaurants: category is required, location is required, and there are optional ones like price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which I think corresponds to the price_range parameter. The location is New York, so I need to format that as \"New York, NY\" as per the function's requirement. They also want outdoor seating, so I should set has_seating_outdoors to true. The category isn't specified, so maybe I need to ask the user for that. Wait, but the function requires the category parameter. The user didn't mention a specific cuisine, so perhaps I should leave it out? Wait, no, the category is required. Hmm, the user didn't specify a category, but the function requires it. That's a problem. Wait, looking back at the function definition for FindRestaurants, the category is required. So the user's query doesn't provide a category. But the user is asking for restaurants in general, maybe without a specific cuisine. But the function requires a category. So maybe I need to inform the user that they need to specify a category. However, the user hasn't provided that. Wait, but the original question says \"tagged as intermediate priced\" and \"include outdoor seating in New York.\" Maybe the category isn't specified, so perhaps the function can be called with a default or general category? But according to the function's parameters, category is required. So this is a missing parameter. Therefore, I should point out that the category is missing. But the user hasn't provided that. Wait, but the user might not know the category. So maybe the assistant should ask for clarification. However, the instructions say that if the parameters are missing, point it out. So in this case, the category is required, but the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. But the user's message doesn't mention a category. So the assistant can't proceed without that. Alternatively, maybe the category can be left as a general term, but according to the function's parameters, it's required. Therefore, the assistant should note that the category is missing. However, the user might have intended to search for any category, but the function requires it. So the answer would be that the category is a required parameter that's missing. But the user's question doesn't specify it. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. However, the user might not have provided it, so the assistant can't proceed. But the initial instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. So in this case, the assistant should mention that the category is required but not provided. However, the user's message is \"I want to find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York.\" So the user didn't specify a category. Therefore, the assistant needs to call the FindRestaurants function but is missing the category parameter. Therefore, the correct action is to point out that the category is missing. But the user might not know the category, so maybe the assistant should ask for it. However, according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the answer would be that the category is a required parameter that's missing. However, the user might have intended to search without a category, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without that information.

So the answer is that the category is a required parameter that's missing. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. But the user's message doesn't have it.

The Music_3_LookupMusic function can be used here. The parameters for this function include artist, album, genre, and year. Since the user mentioned the album name, I should set the album parameter to 'The New Classic'. The other parameters like artist, genre, and year can be set to 'dontcare' because the user isn't specifying them.

So, I need to set the year parameter to 2017. However, the user says \"around six years ago,\" which might include a few years before and after. But the function's year parameter expects a specific four-digit number. Maybe the user wants exactly 2017. I'll use 2017 for the year parameter. Again, other parameters like artist, album, and genre can be 'dontcare' to get a broad range of tracks from that year.\n\nWait, but the user might want songs similar to 'The New Classic' and also from around 2017. Do I need to make two separate calls? The first call for the album similarity and the second for the release year. Yes, because the two criteria are different.

Wait, the function's parameters have required fields as false, so they can be optional. \n\nBut the function requires at least one parameter? Let me check. The parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic are all optional, but the user is specifying either album or year. So including both might be okay. However, the user says \"or alternatively,\" so maybe they want songs from the album or songs from 2019. But the function allows combining parameters. However, if the user wants either, maybe we should make two separate calls? But the function can handle multiple criteria. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are all optional.

The description says \"match the user's specified preferences such as artist, album, genre, and release year.\" So it's likely that the function can take multiple parameters and returns songs matching any of them.

So the assistant should look for songs from the album 'High Expectations' first, and if there are none, then look for songs from 2019.

However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. \n\nBut the user's question is to \"hear a track from the album... or any song that came out in 2019.\" So the assistant needs to retrieve songs that are either from that album or from 2019. However, the Music_3_LookupMusic function might not support OR conditions between parameters. If the function uses AND, then including both parameters would return songs that are in the album and from 2019, which is not what the user wants. \n\nIn that case, maybe the correct approach is to make two separate calls: one with the album parameter and another with the year parameter. But the user might not have specified which one to prioritize. However, the assistant can only make one function call at a time. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function allows for OR conditions. But the parameters are not specified to do that. The function's description says \"match the user's specified preferences such as artist, album, genre, and release year.\" So if the user specifies album and year, it might return songs that match either. But without knowing the function's internal logic, it's safer to assume that the parameters are combined with AND. Therefore, to get either, we need two separate calls. \n\nBut the user might not have the parameters for both. Wait, the user is asking for either the album or the year. So the assistant can first try to find songs from the album. If that returns results, then play one. If not, then look for songs from 2019. But since the assistant can only make one function call per turn, maybe the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the album parameter. If that returns no results, then the next step would be to call it with the year parameter. \n\nBut the user's question is a single request. So the assistant should make the first call for the album. If that fails, then proceed to the year. However, the assistant can't know the result of the first call. Therefore, the correct approach is to make two separate function calls. But the user might not have specified which one to prioritize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can make both calls in one turn. But according to the instructions, the assistant should make one or more function calls. So perhaps the correct answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year=2019. But that would return songs that are both in the album and from 2019, which is not what the user wants. \n\nWait, the user says \"or alternatively,\" which implies that the assistant should look for songs from the album, and if that's not possible, then look for songs from 2019. But the assistant can't know the result of the first call. Therefore, the best approach is to first call the lookup with the album parameter. If that returns no results, then call the lookup with the year parameter. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. \n\nBut the user's question is a single request.

However, the assistant can't do that in one turn. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the album parameter set to 'High Expectations' and the year parameter set to 2019. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, the assistant can call the lookup with the album parameter first. \n\nWait, the user's request is to hear a track from the album or any song from 2019. So the assistant needs to find songs that are either from the album or from 2019. However, the function's parameters are all optional, and the function might not support OR conditions. Therefore, the assistant should make two separate calls: one for the album and one for the year. But the user might not have specified which one to prioritize. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should make one or more function calls. So the correct answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and then call it again with year=2019. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. Therefore, the first step is to call the lookup with the album parameter. If that returns no results, then the next step would be to call the lookup with the year parameter. \n\nBut the user's question is a single request, so the assistant should make the first call for the album. Therefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic(album='High Expectations'). If that returns no results, then the next step would be to call Music_3_LookupMusic(year='2019'). \n\nBut the user might not have specified the parameters for both. However, the user's question includes both options. Therefore, the assistant should make both calls. But the assistant can only make one function call per turn. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the album parameter. If that returns results, then proceed. If not, then call the year. But since the assistant can't know the result, the first function call is to the album. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic(album='High Expectations')."}

So maybe the user's message is missing the date parameter. But the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. However, the function requires an absolute date in ISO format.

Therefore, the assistant might need to ask the user to specify the exact date. However, the user's question is to book a table, so the assistant should try to use the given information. Wait, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the current date's Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, then this Friday is two days away.

Therefore, the assistant should note that the date is missing. But the user's message says \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. So maybe the assistant should proceed by using the relative date, but the function requires an absolute date. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without the exact date. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as part of the request.

Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the current date's Friday. But since the assistant can't know the current date, it's a problem. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the date is required in the correct format. However, the user's message says \"this Friday,\" which is a specific date relative to the current date. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask the user to confirm the exact date. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should make the function call if possible. If the user says \"this Friday,\" but the function requires a specific date, then the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the date is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as part of the request. Wait, the user's message is: \"Can you book a table for four at Balthazar in New York this Friday at 8 in the evening?\" So the date is \"this Friday,\" but the function requires a specific date in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without knowing the exact date. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the date is required in the correct format. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to note that the date is missing. But the user provided \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date. Therefore, the assistant can't convert that into an absolute date without knowing the current date. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the date is required in ISO format. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as part of the request. But in this case, the user hasn't. Therefore, the assistant can't make the reservation. Therefore, the answer is that the date is missing.

Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the date is missing. However, the function requires the date parameter, and the user hasn't provided it in the correct format. Therefore, the assistant should not make the function call and instead inform the user that the date is required. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should return the function calls if possible. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the assistant should not make the function call and instead indicate that the date is missing. However, the user's message says \"this Friday,\" which is a relative date.

Let me look at its parameters. It requires from_city, to_city, departure_date, and optionally num_passengers and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles (but I should format that as Los Angeles, CA to match the required format). The departure_date is March 10th, 2023, which in MM/DD/YYYY format would be 03/10/2023. The num_passengers is 1 since they're traveling alone.

The relevant ones here are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. But the user is asking to book tickets, so probably Trains_1_GetTrainTickets is needed. However, looking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets, it requires the journey_start_time in HH:MM format. The user mentioned \"starting at one day before\" but didn't specify the exact time. Wait, maybe \"one day before\" refers to the date? Wait, the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023. If the journey starts one day before, maybe the date_of_journey is actually May 14? But the user says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, but they want to book tickets for a journey that starts one day before May 15? Or perhaps there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the journey to start on May 15, but the booking is for a date one day before? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the date_of_journey parameter in Trains_1_GetTrainTickets is required and in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15, but they want to book tickets for a journey that starts one day before May 15, which would be May 14. But the user says \"for the journey on May 15\", so perhaps the date_of_journey is May 15. However, the start time is not provided. The user didn't specify the time, but the function requires journey_start_time. So maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date? Like the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before the journey date? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to say the journey starts on May 15, but the booking is for a date one day before, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date? That would be May 14, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in phrasing. Maybe they meant the journey starts on May 15, and they want to book tickets for that date, with the journey starting at a certain time. But the user didn't specify the time. Since the function requires journey_start_time, but the user hasn't provided it, this is a problem. The user might have forgotten to mention the time. However, the user might have intended to say that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the booking date, but that's not relevant here.\n\nIn any case, the function Trains_1_GetTrainTickets requires journey_start_time, which the user hasn't provided. So without that, the function can't be called. The user might need to provide the exact start time. However, the user might have intended to say that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 08:00, but that's just a guess. Since the user hasn't provided the time, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer would be that the required parameter journey_start_time is missing. But the user might have made a mistake in their question. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which is May 14, but that's not logical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey's end? But that's unclear. Since the parameters are required, and the user hasn't provided the journey_start_time, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, looking back at the user's question: \"starting at one day before\" \u2013 perhaps the user meant that the journey starts on May 15, but the booking is for a date one day before, which would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. So maybe the user made a mistake in the date. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to say that the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which is not possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), date_of_journey (May 15, 2023), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (yes), and _class (business). However, journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called without that parameter. The user needs to provide the start time."}

Let me check the parameters again. The service_id is an integer, example: 1 for cleaning. So including service_id=1 makes sense.

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name they provided is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the threshold is 5% error rate, and notifications should go to admin@example.com and support@example.com.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned a global application alert, the create_global_application_alert_config function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (required), alert_type (required), threshold (required), recipients (required), and enabled (optional). The user provided the name, threshold, and recipients. But wait, the alert_type is missing. The threshold is 5%, but what type of alert is this? The error rate would likely correspond to an 'error_rate' alert type. Even though the user didn't specify, it's necessary to include alert_type. However, the problem is that the user didn't mention it. But maybe the alert_type is implied by the threshold's context. Since the function requires alert_type, I need to infer it. Let's assume 'error_rate' as the alert_type here.\n\nSo the parameters would be name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=5.0 (since it's a float), recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], and enabled is optional. The user didn't mention enabling it, so maybe leave enabled as default, which is false. But the function allows enabled to be optional, so it's okay to omit it.\n\nWait, the threshold in the function is a float. The user said 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. But maybe the system expects 5 as a percentage. Wait, the description says \"Units depend on the alert_type.\" So if the alert_type is error rate, maybe it's a percentage. But the parameter is a float. So 5% would be 5.0. Or maybe 0.05? Hmm, but the user wrote 5%, so perhaps the threshold is 5.0. The function's threshold is a float, so 5.0 is acceptable. The exact unit depends on the alert type, which we're assuming is error_rate. So I'll proceed with threshold=5.0.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The enabled parameter isn't specified, so it's omitted. The recipients are an array of the two emails. That should cover all required parameters. The alert_type is necessary, so even though the user didn't specify, we have to include it. Since the threshold is for error rate, alert_type should be 'error_rate'."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user ID is given, so I can use that. But the description mentions shareable tokens, which might be a subset of all tokens.\n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function. It has parameters for include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe set include_expired to true. However, the function doesn't mention a user_id parameter. Wait, the parameters listed don't include user_id. That's a problem because the user provided their ID. If this function doesn't take a user_id, how does it know which user's tokens to retrieve? Maybe it's implied that it's for the authenticated user, but the user provided their ID explicitly. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to get tokens for the current user, so the user_id isn't needed here. But the user specified their ID, so perhaps the first function is the right one. But the first function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not be all tokens. The second function's description says \"associated with the user's account,\" which sounds more comprehensive. However, the parameters for the second function don't include user_id. That's confusing. Maybe the user is authenticated, and the function uses their session, so the user_id isn't needed. But the user provided it, so maybe the first function is the correct one. Wait, the user might be using an API where the user_id is part of the authentication, so the get_api_tokens function might not need it. But the problem is that the user is specifying their user ID, so maybe the first function is the one to use. However, the second function's parameters don't include user_id, which might mean it's for the current user. But the user is providing their ID, so perhaps the first function is the right choice. Alternatively, maybe the second function is the correct one, and the user_id is handled via authentication. Since the user is insistent on getting all tokens, maybe I should use the second function with include_expired=True and page=1, page_size=100 to get as many as possible. But without a user_id parameter, how does it know which user? Maybe the user is authenticated, and the function is for their own tokens. So, even though the user provided their ID, the function doesn't require it. So, the correct call would be to use api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user might need to use the first function if the second one doesn't retrieve all tokens. However, the first function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not include all. The user said \"ALL API TOKENS,\" so maybe the second function is better. But the parameters for the second function don't have user_id. Maybe the user is authenticated, and the function is for their own tokens. Therefore, the correct function to call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True to get all, even expired ones. But the user might need to use the first function if the second one is limited. However, the first function's parameters include user_id, which the user provided. So, perhaps the user needs to call both functions? But the user is asking for all tokens. Maybe the first function is for shareable tokens, and the second is for all tokens. But the second function's parameters don't include user_id. This is a bit confusing. Given the user's urgency, I'll proceed with the first function since it requires the user_id, which the user provided, and set include_revoked to True to get all possible tokens. Alternatively, if the second function is for all tokens, but without user_id, maybe it's for the current user. But the user provided their ID, so maybe the first function is the correct one. I'll go with CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens, even revoked ones."}

The user specified \"7:00 AM\" and the date is tomorrow, which is 2023-12-01. So the alarm_time should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or a time with AM/PM. The user mentioned the date, so I should include it. The time is 7:00 AM, so combining the date and time, it would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. Alternatively, since the date is tomorrow, maybe the user just wants the time of day, but the question says \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which seems like a typo for \"tomorrow, 2023-12-01\". Wait, December 1st is the date, but if today is November 30th, then tomorrow is December 1st. But the user might have meant to set the alarm for 7 AM on December 1st. So the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'.\n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, but the user mentioned it's for a meeting, so adding purpose='meeting' would be helpful. The function allows that. So the correct call would be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'meeting'.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Maybe that's a typo for \"tomorrow, 2023-12-01\". But December 1st is the date, so if today is November 30th, then tomorrow is December 1st. However, the user might have intended to set the alarm for 7 AM on December 1st regardless of the current date. So the alarm_time should include the date. The function allows the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the function call is set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00', purpose='meeting')."}
