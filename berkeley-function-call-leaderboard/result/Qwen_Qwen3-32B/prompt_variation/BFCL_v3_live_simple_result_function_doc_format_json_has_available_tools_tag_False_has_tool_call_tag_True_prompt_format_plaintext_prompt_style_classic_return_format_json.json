The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. \n\nNext, the district_name should be Sankampang, and sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating needs to be 4.5. The function allows specifying these parameters. \n\nI should make sure all the parameters are correctly mapped. The start and end dates aren't mentioned, so they can be omitted. The has_late_check_in is optional and defaults to False, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. \n\nSo the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the required professionals."}
