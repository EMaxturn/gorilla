There are two functions: get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nThe get_sculpture_details function requires a museum location and a sculpture ID. The get_artwork_price function needs a museum location, sculpture material, and dimensions (as an array of integers). \n\nThe user provided two sculptures. For the first sculpture, the location is the Museum of Philadelphia, and the material is marble. The size is 4x4 ft. For the second sculpture, the location is New York, material is bronze, and size is 6x3 ft. \n\nBut wait, the user didn't provide the sculpture IDs. The get_sculpture_details function requires both parameters. Since the user didn't mention the IDs, maybe I can't use that function. However, the get_artwork_price function requires the material and size, but not the ID. \n\nSo, I need to call get_artwork_price for both sculptures. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price need the museum location, material, and size. The user provided the locations and materials, but the sizes are given as 4x4 and 6x3. The function expects an array of integers for the size. So, I can pass those as a list. \n\nBut the problem is that the user didn't provide the sculpture IDs. However, maybe the get_sculpture_details function can be used with the IDs, but since they aren't provided, perhaps I can't. But the user's question is about the average price, so maybe the get_artwork_price function can be used for both, even if we don't have the IDs. \n\nWait, the get_artwork_price function's parameters are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user provided the locations and materials, but the sizes are given as 4x4 and 6x3. So, for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with those parameters. \n\nSo, the steps would be: call get_artwork_price for the first sculpture (Philadelphia, marble, 4x4 ft) and another call for the second (New York, bronze, 6x3 ft). Then average the prices. \n\nBut the user's question is about the average price, so maybe the functions can be used to get individual prices and then average them. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to make two function calls: one for each sculpture, using the provided details. Then, once the prices are retrieved, compute the average. \n\nSo, the function calls would be:\n\nget_artwork_price(museum_location=\"Museum of Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4])\n\nget_artwork_price(museum_location=\"New York museum\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3])\n\nThen, average the two prices."}

The machine moves 2 meters, so work is energy * 2. \n\nNow, I need to check if each function is applicable. The first function is 'biological.calc_energy' which takes mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The glucose is C6H12O6, so that's the substance. The energy per mole is 2800 kJ/mol.

Since the user didn't specify case_type, I'll use the default. Same for item_type. So all four function calls should be correct."}
