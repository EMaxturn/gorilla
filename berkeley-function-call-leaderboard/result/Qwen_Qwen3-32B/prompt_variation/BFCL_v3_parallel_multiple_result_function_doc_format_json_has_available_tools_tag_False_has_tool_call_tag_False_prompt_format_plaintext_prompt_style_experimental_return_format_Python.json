There's animal_population.get_history for historical data and animal_population.get_projection for future projections. \n\nFor the historical data part, the parameters required are country, species, and years.

The user wants to use data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model predicting future sales, with x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], and also calculate residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data from the CSV file. The function data_loading is available for that. The parameters required are file_path, which is 'dataset.csv', and an optional delimiter, defaulting to ','. So I should call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The function linear_regression_fit requires x and y arrays. The user specified x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']. Assuming the loaded data is a structure like a pandas DataFrame or a dictionary, accessing those columns should work. Also, the user wants residuals, so return_residuals should be True.\n\nBut wait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit are x and y as arrays. So I need to make sure that after loading the data, the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns are extracted as arrays. However, the data_loading function's output isn't specified here. Maybe it returns a DataFrame or a similar structure. The user's code would need to handle that, but in the function calls, I just need to reference the parameters correctly.\n\nSo the steps are: first load the data, then pass the appropriate columns to the linear regression function. But how to represent that in the function calls? The user's instruction says to generate the function calls. So first, call data_loading to get the data, then use that data's columns in linear_regression_fit.\n\nBut in the function call syntax, how do I reference the data from the previous function? The problem is that the functions are called sequentially, and the output of data_loading would be the data structure. Assuming that the data_loading function returns the data in a variable called data, then the linear_regression_fit can use data['sales'] and data['future_sales'].\n\nBut in the parameters for the functions, the user needs to specify the actual parameters. So the first function call is data_loading(file_path='dataset.csv'), which loads the data. Then, the second function call is linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True.\n\nHowever, in the function call notation, how do I pass the data from the first function to the second? The problem is that each function call is independent here. The parameters for linear_regression_fit would need the actual arrays, but in reality, the data is loaded first, then processed. Since the user is asking for the sequence of function calls, I think the correct approach is to first call data_loading, then use the result of that to get x and y for the linear regression.\n\nBut in the generated function calls, how to represent that? The user's instruction says to generate the function calls, so perhaps the first call is data_loading, and then the second call uses the data from that. However, the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as arrays. So the user would need to have the data loaded first, then extract the columns. But in the function call syntax, I can't directly reference the output of a previous function. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call data_loading, then pass the appropriate columns to linear_regression_fit.\n\nBut in the answer, the assistant needs to output the function calls in order. So the first function is data_loading, then the second is linear_regression_fit with x and y as the columns from the loaded data. However, the parameters for x and y in the linear_regression_fit function would be the actual arrays. Since the data_loading function returns the data structure, the user would need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns from it. But in the function call parameters, how to represent that? The assistant can't know the structure of the data, but the user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so the function call would have to use those as parameters. Therefore, the correct function calls are:\n\ndata_loading(file_path='dataset.csv'), linear_regression_fit(x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], return_residuals=True)\n\nBut the problem is that in reality, the data variable isn't passed between function calls in this notation. However, given the user's instruction, this is the correct sequence. The user is expected to have the data loaded into a variable called data, then use that. So the assistant's answer should be those two function calls in order."}

So I need to call getWeight for both neutron and proton with unit 'amu'.\n\nNext, the diameter. The function scienceFacts.getDiameter is available, needing particle and unit. The unit specified is femtometers. So I should call getDiameter for both proton and neutron with unit 'femtometers'.\n\nWait, the user listed Proton and Neutron for both parts. For weight, it's Neutron and Proton, then diameter for Proton and Neutron. But the order might not matter here since the function calls are separate.

For the first one, it's a 4ft x 4ft marble statue in Philadelphia. The second is 6ft x 3ft bronze in New York. The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nSo for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with their respective parameters. The size needs to be an array of integers. But the user gave feet measurements. Maybe they need to be converted to inches or centimeters? But the function doesn't specify, so I'll assume the user provided the correct units expected by the function. \n\nFirst sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is [4,4]. Second sculpture: museum_location is New York, material is bronze, size is [6,3]. \n\nWait, the size is an array of integers. The user said 4ft x 4ft, so maybe that's two dimensions. But sculptures might have three dimensions (height, width, depth). However, the user only provided two for each. Maybe the function can handle it with two values. I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nSo two separate calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture. Then, once I have both prices, I can calculate the average. But the functions don't do averaging; that's up to the user. The user wants the average, so after getting both prices, I can compute it. But since the functions can't be called in a sequence here, I need to make sure both function calls are generated. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price twice with the respective parameters for each sculpture. The user didn't mention needing details about the sculptures, so get_sculpture_details isn't necessary here. \n\nCheck if all required parameters are present.

The user has three parts to their problem. \n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from 5 moles of glucose. The function biological.calc_energy seems right here. The parameters required are mols and substance. They mentioned glucose (C6H12O6) and the energy per mol is 2800 kJ/mol, which is the default, so I don't need to specify that unless it's different. So the first call would be calc_energy with mols=5 and substance=\"C6H12O6\".\n\nSecond, using that energy, calculate the biomass with 10% efficiency. The function biological.calc_biomass takes energy and efficiency. Since efficiency defaults to 0.1 (10%), if the user specifies 10%, we can use the default. So the second call is calc_biomass with energy from the first result and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, calculate the work done by the machine moving 2 meters. The physical.calc_work function needs energy and distance. The energy here is the same as the first calculation's result, and distance is 2 meters.

The energy here is the total energy produced, not the biomass. So yes, using the first energy value. \n\nI need to make sure each function is called in order.

First, they want to know the collectable fish in Animal Crossing during summer. The get_collectables_in_season function seems right. I need game_name as 'Animal Crossing', season as 'Summer', and item_type as 'fish'. That's the first call.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. So game is 'Fortnite', platform 'Playstation', region 'Asia'. Second call done.\n\nThen, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name and year. Parameters are 'Apple Inc.' and 2018. Third call set.\n\nLastly, binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function takes those parameters. Number_of_trials=10, number_of_successes=3, probability_of_success=0.7. Fourth call ready.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included and the order matches the user's request. No optional parameters missed. Looks good. Let's list them out in order."}
