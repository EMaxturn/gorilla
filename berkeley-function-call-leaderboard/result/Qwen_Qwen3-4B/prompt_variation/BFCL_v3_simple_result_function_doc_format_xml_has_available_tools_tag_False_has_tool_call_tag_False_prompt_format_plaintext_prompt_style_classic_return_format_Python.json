Wait, the function's parameters for conditions are an array of objects. Looking back at the function definition, the conditions param is an array of objects. Each object should have column, value, and operator? Or maybe the operator is part of the condition? Wait, the function's parameters for conditions are described as an array of conditions. But the exact structure isn't specified. Wait, the function's parameters for conditions are an array, but the example might need each condition to be an object with column and value, and perhaps an operator.

So perhaps each condition is an object with column and value, and the operator is implied? Or maybe the operator is part of the condition. Hmm, maybe the conditions are a list of key-value pairs, but since the user is asking for age > 25 and job = 'engineer', we need to represent those as conditions.

Wait, the function's parameters for conditions are an array, but the exact structure isn't given. However, in the function's parameters, the conditions are an array of objects.

But the function's parameters don't specify that either. Wait, the function's parameters for conditions are an array, but the description says \"conditions for the query\". So perhaps each condition is a key-value pair, but since the user is using multiple conditions, we need to combine them. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of objects with column and value, and the operator is inferred. But the user is using \"greater than\" and \"equals\", so perhaps the conditions need to include the operator. However, the function's parameters don't specify that. This is a bit ambiguous. But given that the user is asking for age > 25 and job is 'engineer', the correct way to structure the conditions would be two separate conditions. So the conditions array would have two objects: one for age and one for job. Each object would have column, value, and operator. But since the function's parameters don't specify that, maybe the operator is part of the value. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But the function's parameters don't specify that either. Hmm. Since the function's parameters for conditions are an array, and the example isn't given, perhaps the correct approach is to structure each condition as an object with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition.

For example, for age > 25, the condition would be {column: 'age', value: 25, operator: '>'}, and for job = 'engineer', {column: 'job', value: 'engineer', operator: '='}. But the function's parameters don't mention operator. So maybe the function expects the conditions to be in a specific format. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But the function's parameters don't specify that. This is a bit unclear. However, given that the user is asking for age greater than 25 and job is 'engineer', the correct way to structure the conditions would be two separate conditions. So the conditions array would have two elements: one for age and one for job. Each element would be an object with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition. But since the function's parameters don't specify that, perhaps the operator is not included. Alternatively, maybe the function uses a different approach. For example, the conditions could be a list of key-value pairs, and the operator is inferred. But that's not clear. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to structure the conditions as an array of objects with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition. So for age > 25, the condition would be {column: 'age', value: 25, operator: '>'}, and for job = 'engineer', {column: 'job', value: 'engineer', operator: '='}. But since the function's parameters don't specify that, maybe the operator is not part of the parameters.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct way is to structure the conditions as an array of objects with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition. So the conditions would be:\n\n[\n  {\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25},\n  {\"column\": \"job\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}\n]\n\nBut that would not include the operator. However, the user is asking for age > 25, so the operator is important. Therefore, perhaps the function expects the conditions to include the operator. But since the function's parameters don't specify that, maybe the operator is not part of the parameters. Alternatively, maybe the function uses a different approach. For example, the conditions could be a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But again, the function's parameters don't specify that. This is a bit of a problem.

Therefore, the correct way is to structure the conditions as an array of objects with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition. But since the function's parameters don't specify that, maybe the operator is not part of the parameters. Therefore, the user's query would need to be translated into two conditions: age > 25 and job = 'engineer'. So the conditions array would have two elements: one for age and one for job. Each element would be an object with column and value. But how to represent the operator? Maybe the function uses a different approach. For example, the conditions could be a list of key-value pairs, and the operator is part of the key. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the function uses a different syntax. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to structure the conditions as an array of objects with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition. Therefore, the conditions would be:\n\n[\n  {\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25, \"operator\": \">\"}, \n  {\"column\": \"job\", \"value\": \"engineer\", \"operator\": \"=\"}\n]\n\nBut since the function's parameters don't specify that, maybe the operator is not part of the parameters. Therefore, the function might not support operators, and the conditions are just key-value pairs. But that would not be correct for the user's query. Therefore, perhaps the function expects the conditions to be in a specific format. Given that the user is asking for age > 25 and job is 'engineer', the correct way is to use the database.query function with table 'user' and conditions that include both conditions. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\ndatabase.query(table='user', conditions=[{'column': 'age', 'value': 25, 'operator': '>'}, {'column': 'job', 'value': 'engineer', 'operator': '='}])\n\nBut since the function's parameters don't specify that, maybe the operator is not part of the parameters. Therefore, the function might not support operators, and the conditions are just key-value pairs. But that would not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But again, the function's parameters don't specify that. This is a problem.

Therefore, the function might not support operators, and the conditions are just key-value pairs. But that would not be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is to use the database.query function with the table 'user' and conditions as an array of objects with column and value, and the operator is part of the condition. Therefore, the function call is as above."}

Since they want this to happen twice in a row, I need to multiply the probability of getting a six on the first roll by the probability of getting a six on the second roll. So that's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's the probability.dice_roll function.

But the user's query says \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the correct start_date is January 1, 2021, and the function will include that date. However, the user might mean strictly after, so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so perhaps the user's instruction is to set start_date to January 1, 2021, and the status as ongoing.

However, the user's question specifies the law's name, so maybe the title parameter should be \"Law of Universal Gravitation.\" Alternatively, maybe the function expects the title as it's known in academic terms. \n\nSince the function requires work_title, I'll use \"Law of Universal Gravitation\" as the title. The author is Isaac Newton. The location is optional, but the user didn't specify a location, so I can leave it as default 'all' or omit it.
