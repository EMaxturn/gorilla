But in the function list, it is presented as:\n    # Function: ChaDri.change_drink\n\nBut in the call format, we are to use the function name as given. Since the function is named \"ChaDri.change_drink\", we must call it exactly as such.\n\nBut note: the function definition says \"ChaDri.change_drink\", so we call it as:\n    ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id='123', new_preferences={'size': 'large', 'temperature': 'hot', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk_type': 'almond milk'})\n\nHowever, wait: the function name in the definition is written as \"ChaDri.change_drink\", but in the function list it is written as:\n    # Function: ChaDri.change_drink\n\nBut in the user request, it's about updating the drink order. We have the drink_id and the new_preferences.\n\nBut note: the function name in the call must be exactly as provided. The function name is \"ChaDri.change_drink\", but note the case? The first letter is capitalized in the function list? Actually, the function list has \"ChaDri\" (with a capital 'C')? Let me check:\n\nIn the function list, it is written as:\n    # Function: ChaDri.change_drink\n\nBut the function name in the call should be exactly as given. The example format says: [func_name1(...), ...]. So we use \"ChaDri.change_drink\".\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the function is defined with:\n    # Function: ChaDri.change_drink\n\nSo we use that.\n\nBut note: the function name in the call might be case sensitive? The problem says: \"put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\". So we should use the exact function name as provided.\n\nSo for the food change: ChaFod\n    foodItem: \"Caesar salad\"\n    removeIngredients: \"anchovies\"\n\nFor the drink change: ChaDri.change_drink\n    drink_id: \"123\"\n    new_preferences: a dictionary with the updated preferences.\n\nBut note: the new_preferences is a dictionary. We must represent it as a dictionary in the call.\n\nWe are to output two function calls? Since there are two independent changes? We can do both in one response.\n\nSo the response should be:\n\n[ChaFod(foodItem='Caesar salad', removeIngredients='anchovies'), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id='123', new_preferences={'size': 'large', 'temperature': 'hot', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk_type': 'almond milk'})]\n\nBut note: the function ChaFod has other parameters that we are leaving as default. We can omit them because they have default values. So we only specify the ones we are changing.\n\nSimilarly, for ChaDri.change_drink, we are providing both required arguments.\n\nHowever, the function ChaFod expects:\n    foodItem (str)\n    newIngredients (str, default='')\n    removeIngredients (str, default='')\n    specialInstructions (str, default='')\n\nWe are providing foodItem and removeIngredients, and we skip newIngredients and specialInstructions because they are default and we don't have any.\n\nBut note: the function call format requires the parameters by name. We are using named parameters.\n\nSo let's write the function calls:\n\nFirst call: ChaFod with:\n    foodItem='Caesar salad'\n    removeIngredients='anchovies'\n\nSecond call: ChaDri.change_drink with:\n    drink_id='123'\n    new_preferences={'size': 'large', 'temperature': 'hot', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk_type': 'almond milk'}\n\nBut note: the dictionary in new_preferences must be represented correctly. We are using Python-like syntax.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nWe have all the required parameters for both functions.\n\nSo we output:\n\n[ChaFod(foodItem='Caesar salad', removeIngredients='anchovies'), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id='123', new_preferences={'size': 'large', 'temperature': 'hot', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk_type': 'almond milk'})]\n\nBut note: the function name for the drink is \"ChaDri.change_drink\", not \"ChaDri\" alone. So we write it as \"ChaDri.change_drink\".\n\nHowever, in the function list, it is written as \"ChaDri.change_drink\", so we use that exact name.\n\nOne more thing: the customer said \"update my order 123\". We assume that 123 is the drink_id. But note that the function ChaDri.change_drink expects a drink_id (a string). So we pass it as a string.\n\nLet me write the response accordingly."}

However, the user request is clear to use metric, so either way is acceptable.\n\n We are to output the function calls in the required format.\n\n We have two calls, so we will output two function calls in a list.\n\n Format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\n For Guangzhou: get_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, China')\n For Beijing: get_current_weather(location='Beijing, China')\n\n However, note that the function expects a string for location. We are using the exact string.\n\n But note: the function might have a requirement for the format. The example uses 'Berkeley, CA' and 'London, UK'. \n So we are using the same pattern: city and country.\n\n Let's write the calls accordingly.\n\n Important: The function call must be in the exact format as described.\n\n We are only allowed to output the function calls, no extra text.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n [get_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, China'), get_current_weather(location='Beijing, China')]\n\n However, note that the function also has an optional parameter 'unit'. Since we are using the default (metric) and the user wants metric, we can omit it.\n\n Alternatively, we can include it to be explicit. The problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n Here, the required parameter is location, and we are providing it. The unit is optional and we are happy with the default.\n\n So we can do without the unit.\n\n But wait: the user said \"\u8bf7\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5236\u5355\u4f4d\", which means metric. So to be safe, we can set unit='metric'. \n However, the default is already metric. So it's redundant but safe.\n\n Let's do it with unit to be explicit.\n\n For the first call: location='Guangzhou, China', unit='metric'\n For the second call: location='Beijing, China', unit='metric'\n\n But note: the function expects the unit as a string. The default is 'metric'. So setting unit='metric' is the same as default.\n\n We are allowed to set it. So we can write:\n\n [get_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, China', unit='metric'), get_current_weather(location='Beijing, China', unit='metric')]\n\n However, the function definition says the default for unit is 'metric'. So we can also skip.\n\n But the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n Here, the required parameter is location. The unit is optional and we are using the default. So skipping unit is acceptable.\n\n However, to strictly follow the user's request (which explicitly says to use metric), we can include it.\n\n I think both are acceptable. Let's choose to include the unit for clarity.\n\n Alternatively, we can also call without unit and rely on the default.\n\n Since the user specifically asked for metric, and the function default is metric, we are safe to skip.\n\n But to be safe and explicit, I will include the unit.\n\n However, note that the function call format: we must use the exact parameter names.\n\n So:\n\n [get_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, China', unit='metric'), get_current_weather(location='Beijing, China', unit='metric')]\n\n But wait: the function expects the location as a string. We are using the string exactly as we think the function expects.\n\n However, note: the function examples are in English. The cities are in Chinese. But the function might not accept Chinese characters? \n The problem does not specify. But the examples are in English. \n\n Let me re-read the function description: \n   \"location (str): The location for which the weather is being requested, in the format of 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'London, UK'.\"\n\n The examples are in English. But the function might be designed to handle international city names? \n\n The user's request is in Chinese, but the function might expect the city name in English? Or in the local language? \n\n The problem does not specify. However, in the context, the user asked for the cities in Chinese: \"\u4e2d\u56fd\u5e7f\u5dde\u5e02\" and \"\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\".\n\n But the function examples are in English. So we might need to use the English names? \n\n Alternatively, we can try with the Chinese names? \n\n Since the problem doesn't specify, and we don't have a function to translate, we have to make a decision.\n\n The function is called \"get_current_weather\", and it's common for such APIs to accept both local and English names. \n But to be safe, we can use the English names for the cities.\n\n How do we know the English names? \n   Guangzhou is the English name for \u5e7f\u5dde\u5e02, and Beijing is the English name for \u5317\u4eac\u5e02.\n\n So we can use:\n   Guangzhou, China\n   Beijing, China\n\n Therefore, we use the English city names.\n\n Alternatively, if the function supports Chinese, we could use:\n   '\u5e7f\u5dde\u5e02, \u4e2d\u56fd'\n   '\u5317\u4eac\u5e02, \u4e2d\u56fd'\n\n But the examples are in English, and the function description doesn't specify. \n\n However, note: the function examples are in English, and the system might be designed for an English-speaking audience? \n\n But the user is speaking Chinese. \n\n Without knowing the implementation, we have to rely on the examples. \n\n The problem says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n We are not pointing out because we are making a call. \n\n But we are unsure about the language. \n\n However, the problem does not indicate that the function requires English. It only says the format: 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. \n\n So it might accept any string. \n\n But to be safe, let's use the English names because the examples are in English.\n\n So we'll use:\n   location='Guangzhou, China'\n   location='Beijing, China'\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the Chinese names? But the examples are in English. \n\n Since the problem does not specify, we'll go with the English names.\n\n Therefore, the function calls are:\n\n [get_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, China', unit='metric'), get_current_weather(location='Beijing, China', unit='metric')]\n\n But note: the function expects the location as a string. We are providing the string in the format we believe is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the function expects the state abbreviation for cities in the US, but for China, we are using the country. \n That is acceptable because the example includes 'London, UK' which uses country.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n Final decision: \n   We will call the function twice with the English city names and country, and set unit to metric.\n\n Output the two function calls in the required format."}

The cloned repo will be in a directory named after the repo. Since the URL is `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git`, the default directory will be `nodejs-welcome`.\n   - However, note that the `clone_repo` function by default clones into the current directory and the repo name becomes the directory. So we can assume the directory is `nodejs-welcome`.\n\n   - After analysis, we need to create a Dockerfile. We have a function `create_a_docker_file` that takes `directory_name`. We'll use `nodejs-welcome` as the directory.\n\n   - Then, we need to create Kubernetes YAMLs. We have `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` that takes several arguments. We are not given specifics, so we can use the defaults for most. However, note that the function requires:\n        directory_name: again, `nodejs-welcome`\n        deployment_name: not provided, so we can use the default (which the function will handle by using the directory name? The function doesn't specify a default for deployment_name, but the doc says \"use Defaults if not provided\" -> so we can omit it? But the function signature requires it. Wait, let me check the function description:\n\n        The function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` has the following parameters:\n          directory_name (str): required.\n          deployment_name (str): required? The doc says: \"The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\" -> but in the function signature, it is listed without a default. However, the user instruction says \"if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n\n        Since the user did not provide a deployment_name, we must either choose a default or note that it is missing. But the function's docstring says \"use Defaults if not provided\", so we can assume that if we don't pass it, the function will use a default. However, the function signature in the doc does not mark it as having a default. This is a conflict.\n\n        Let me re-read the function description:\n\n          deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n\n        This implies that the function expects the caller to provide a default if the user doesn't. But in our case, we don't have one. We can try to use the directory name as the deployment name? Or we can leave it out? The function requires it, so we must provide something.\n\n        Since the function doc says \"use Defaults if not provided\", we can interpret that the function has a default built-in. However, in the function signature above, it is not marked as having a default. This might be an error in the documentation.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, and since the user request does not specify, we can set `deployment_name` to the directory name (e.g., \"nodejs-welcome\") or use a generic one. Alternatively, we can note that the function requires a deployment_name and we don't have one. But the instruction says to use defaults if not provided. So we can skip the parameter? But the function requires it.\n\n        Actually, the function signature in the doc does not have a default for `deployment_name` (it's not written as `deployment_name (str, default= ...)`). So we must provide it.\n\n        How about we use the directory name for the deployment name? That seems reasonable.\n\n        Similarly, for `image_name`, the function has a default of 'latest'. But we don't have an image name. The user hasn't built an image yet. We are just generating the YAML. We can use a placeholder? The function defaults to 'latest'. However, note that the function doc says: \"image_name (str, default='latest')\". So we can omit it and the function will use 'latest'. But wait, the function also says \"use latest if not provided\", so we can leave it out? But the function signature in the doc does not mark it as having a default? Actually, it does: `image_name (str, default='latest')`.\n\n        So for `image_name` we can skip because it has a default. For `deployment_name`, it does not have a default in the signature? Actually, the doc says: `deployment_name (str): ... use Defaults if not provided.` -> meaning that we are expected to provide a value? Or the function will use a default? The phrasing is ambiguous.\n\n        Since we are in a bind, and the user did not specify, I will use the directory name for the deployment name.\n\n        For other parameters: \n          replicas: default 1\n          port: default 80 (but we don't know the port of the application). We can analyze the repo? But the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the predominant language. It doesn't return the port. So we have to rely on the user's request: the step says \"based on the analysis\". But the analysis function we have only returns the language. We don't have a function to get the port. So we must use the default 80? Or note that we don't know. Since the user didn't specify, we'll use 80.\n\n        Similarly, service_type: default 'ClusterIP'.\n\n        So we'll call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with:\n          directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n          deployment_name: 'nodejs-welcome'   (we use the directory name as a default for deployment)\n          image_name: we can omit because it defaults to 'latest'\n          replicas: omit (default 1)\n          port: omit (default 80)\n          service_type: omit (default 'ClusterIP')\n\n        But note: the function requires `deployment_name` and we are providing it.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes.\n   - We have a function `push_git_changes_to_github` that will automatically add all changes and then commit and push. But note: the function does both commit and push. So step 3 and 4 are covered by this function.\n\n   - The function `push_git_changes_to_github` takes:\n        directory_name: the repo directory, which is 'nodejs-welcome'\n        commit_message: we can use the default 'Update changes'\n        branch_name: default 'main'\n        force_push: default False\n\n   - However, note that the user request says:\n        3. add all changed file to git changes \n        4. commit / push to repo\n\n   - Since the function does all of these (it adds, commits, and pushes), we can call it.\n\n But note: the user request says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then step 4 is commit and push. The function does step 3 and 4 together.\n\n However, let me check the function doc: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So yes, it does step 3 and 4.\n\n But note: the repo we cloned is a new clone, so we haven't set up the remote? Actually, the clone command sets up the remote. So we are safe.\n\n However, the function `push_git_changes_to_github` requires the directory name and we are going to use 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n Also note: the user didn't specify a branch, so we use the default 'main'. But what if the original repo uses 'master'? The function defaults to 'main'. We can try to check? But we don't have a function to get the current branch. Since the user didn't specify, we'll use the default.\n\n But note: the clone command will check out the default branch of the remote. We don't know if it's main or master. The function `push_git_changes_to_github` uses 'main' by default. If the branch in the cloned repo is not 'main', we might be on a different branch. However, the function doesn't change the branch, it just pushes to the specified branch. We are currently on the branch that was checked out by clone.\n\n We have two options:\n   1. Assume the branch is 'main'. If it's not, the push might fail or create a new branch? But the user didn't specify.\n   2. We don't have a function to get the current branch, so we cannot know.\n\n Given the constraints, we'll use the default branch 'main'. If the actual branch is different, we might need to adjust. But the user request does not specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function `push_git_changes_to_github` has a `branch_name` parameter. We could try to get the current branch? But we don't have a function for that. So we must rely on the user to have specified if they want a different branch? They didn't.\n\n Since the user did not specify, we'll use the default.\n\n But note: the user request says \"commit / push to repo\" without a branch. So we are safe to use the default.\n\n However, the original repo might have been cloned and the HEAD might be at a branch that is not main. But the function `push_git_changes_to_github` pushes to the branch we specify, which might be different than the current branch. We want to push the current branch? The function doesn't say. It says: \"Pushes all changes ... to the associated GitHub remote repository\" and it uses the branch_name. So it will push to that branch, regardless of the current branch? That might not be what we want.\n\n We don't have a way to get the current branch. So we have to assume the user wants to push to the branch that was cloned? But the function doesn't let us get the current branch.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the user didn't specify a branch, we'll use the default 'main'. If the cloned branch is not main, then we might need to change the branch_name to match. But we cannot know without additional tools.\n\n We'll proceed with the default.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function `push_git_changes_to_github` might have an issue if the current branch is not the one we are pushing to. But we don't have control over that.\n\n Plan:\n\n   Step 1: Clone the repo.\n   Step 2: \n        a) Analyze the repo: call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory 'nodejs-welcome'. Why? Because we need to know the language to create the Dockerfile? Actually, the function `create_a_docker_file` might use the analysis? But the function `create_a_docker_file` doesn't take the language as input. It only takes the directory. How does it know what to put in the Dockerfile? \n\n        Looking at the function description for `create_a_docker_file`: \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory to enable containerization of the application.\" It doesn't say it uses the analysis. So why do we need to analyze? The user request says \"based on the analysis\". So the function `create_a_docker_file` might rely on the analysis? But we don't see any connection.\n\n        Actually, the function `create_a_docker_file` is independent. But the user request says to analyze and then create the Dockerfile. So we must call `analyse_repo_contents`? But the result is not passed to `create_a_docker_file`. \n\n        This suggests that the `create_a_docker_file` function internally uses the analysis? Or we are expected to use the result to adjust the Dockerfile creation? But the function `create_a_docker_file` doesn't take the language. So how?\n\n        I think the function `create_a_docker_file` might be implemented to look at the directory and determine the language itself. So we don't need to call `analyse_repo_contents` for the Dockerfile? But the user request says to analyze the repo and then create the Dockerfile. So we must call `analyse_repo_contents`? It might be for our own information? Or for the Kubernetes YAML? The Kubernetes YAML function doesn't take a language either.\n\n        Alternatively, the analysis might be a prerequisite for the Dockerfile creation? But the function `create_a_docker_file` doesn't require it.\n\n        So why is the analysis step there? Maybe it's not needed? But the user request says to do it.\n\n        We will call `analyse_repo_contents` because the user requested it. Even though the result isn't used by the subsequent functions, we do it for the record.\n\n        So:\n          Step 2: \n            - analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n            - then create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n            - then create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   Step 3 and 4: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n However, note that the user request says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then step 4 is commit and push. The function `push_git_changes_to_github` does both.\n\n But note: the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does a commit with a default message. The user didn't specify a commit message, so we use the default.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n   Step 2: \n        analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome')\n   Step 3 and 4: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n However, note that the clone_repo function does not specify a destination. It defaults to the current directory. The subsequent functions are called with the directory name 'nodejs-welcome', which is the default directory that the repo is cloned into.\n\n But what if the clone_repo function creates the directory in a different location? We are using the default, so it will be in the current directory and named 'nodejs-welcome'. So we are safe.\n\n Also, note that the user request says \"create/update dockerfile\". The function `create_a_docker_file` will create or update? The function description says \"Generates a Dockerfile\", which implies it creates one. If one exists, it might overwrite? We don't know. But the user says \"create/update\", so it's acceptable.\n\n Similarly, the Kubernetes YAML file will be created.\n\n Let's write the function calls in the required format.\n\n Important: We must output the function calls in the format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params), ...]\n\n We are doing multiple steps, so we output multiple function calls.\n\n But note: the system will consider the current turn complete when we have no more functions to call. We are going to output all the function calls at once? The instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". So we can output a list of multiple function calls.\n\n However, the format is a list of function calls in one response.\n\n Example: [func1(a=1, b=2), func2(c=3)]\n\n We'll do:\n\n   [\n      clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'),\n      analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n      create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n      create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n      push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n   ]\n\n But note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` has other parameters that we are not setting? We are setting only directory_name and deployment_name. The rest are using their defaults. So we can omit them.\n\n However, the function requires `deployment_name` and we are providing it. The rest are optional.\n\n But wait: the function signature for `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` includes:\n        directory_name (str)\n        deployment_name (str)\n        image_name (str, default='latest')\n        replicas (int, default=1)\n        port (int, default=80)\n        service_type (str, default='ClusterIP')\n\n We are only required to provide `directory_name` and `deployment_name`? Actually, the function requires `directory_name` and `deployment_name` (since they don't have defaults in the signature? The function doc says for `deployment_name`: \"use Defaults if not provided\", but the signature doesn't show a default. So we must provide it. The rest we can skip.\n\n So the above list is correct.\n\n However, note that the function `push_git_changes_to_github` has optional parameters. We are only providing `directory_name` and using the defaults for the rest.\n\n Let's write it.\n\n But note: the function names must be exactly as given.\n\n Final list of function calls:\n\n   [\n      clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'),\n      analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n      create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n      create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n      push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n   ]\n\n However, what if the repo already has a Dockerfile? The user says \"create/update\", so we are updating. But the function `create_a_docker_file` might overwrite without checking? We don't know. But the user request says to do it.\n\n Similarly, the Kubernetes YAML might be created in the same directory.\n\n We are following the user's steps.\n\n Let's output the function calls."}

Find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories.\n 2. Get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\n For the first part, we can use the function `get_relevant_classes` to search for classes related to 'CellResult'. Since we are to include subdirectories, we set `include_subdirectories=True`.\n For the second part, we can use the function `get_signature` to get the signatures of the methods. We note that the class name is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. Since these are public methods, we don't need to include private ones.\n\n However, note that the function `get_signature` requires the class name and method name. We are only asked for two methods in the same class.\n\n But note: the function `get_signature` is defined to retrieve the signature of a method within a given class. We don't have the module name, but the function `get_signature` does not require a module name. We assume that the class 'AbstractCellHandler' is available in the current context.\n\n We break down the calls:\n\n 1. Call `get_relevant_classes` to search for classes related to 'CellResult':\n    - search_string: 'CellResult'\n    - include_subdirectories: True (since we are to include subdirectories)\n\n 2. Call `get_signature` for the method 'setCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n 3. Call `get_signature` for the method 'getCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n\n However, note that the function `get_signature` can only handle one method at a time. So we need two separate calls.\n\n Alternatively, we could use `get_class_info` for the entire class and then extract the two methods? But the question specifically asks for the signatures of those two methods. Also, note that `get_class_info` returns a lot of information (methods, properties, constructor). We are only interested in two methods. However, if we use `get_class_info` we might get all the methods and then we can filter, but the function `get_signature` is designed for a single method and might be more direct.\n\n Considering the available functions, we have two options for the methods:\n   Option 1: Use `get_signature` twice (once for each method)\n   Option 2: Use `get_class_info` for the class and then we can look at the methods? But note the function `get_class_info` returns the entire class info. However, the problem says we are to return the function calls. We are not processing the results. So we must choose the function that gives exactly what we need.\n\n Since the user specifically asks for the signatures of two methods, and we have a function that returns the signature of a single method, we can make two calls.\n\n But note: the function `get_class_info` might be more efficient if we are going to look at multiple methods? However, the user only asked for two. Also, the function `get_signature` is designed for this.\n\n Let's do:\n\n Step 1: Search for classes related to 'CellResult'\n   [get_relevant_classes(search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True)]\n\n Step 2: Get the signature for 'setCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'\n   [get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue')]\n\n Step 3: Get the signature for 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'\n   [get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue')]\n\n However, note the format: we are to return multiple function calls in one response? The instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]\"\n\n We can return a list of three function calls.\n\n But note: the function `get_signature` has an optional parameter `include_private` which defaults to False. We don't need to set it because we are only interested in public methods.\n\n However, the function `get_relevant_classes` also has a `case_sensitive` parameter which defaults to False. We are okay with the default.\n\n So we write:\n\n [get_relevant_classes(search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue'), get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue')]\n\n But note: in the function `get_relevant_classes` the parameter is `include_subdirectories` (plural) but I wrote `include_subdirectories` in the description. Actually, the docstring says: `include_subdirectories (bool, default=False)`. So the parameter name is `include_subdirectories`.\n\n Correction: the function call for `get_relevant_classes` should be:\n   `include_subdirectories=True`\n\n Also, note: the search string is 'CellResult'. We are using the exact string.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the user might have meant to search for classes that are related to 'CellResult', but the function `get_relevant_classes` uses a keyword search. So it should return classes that have the string 'CellResult' in their name or description? The docstring says: \"Retrieves a list of class names from the repository that potentially match the provided search criteria.\" and it's a search by keyword.\n\n So we are using the string as the keyword.\n\n Now, we output the function calls accordingly.\n\n Important: The function names and parameters must be exactly as in the provided functions.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n[\n  get_relevant_classes(search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True),\n  get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue'),\n  get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue')\n]\n\n But note: the function `get_signature` does not require the module name? The function definition does not have a module_name parameter. So we are safe.\n\n However, the function `get_signature` has an optional `include_private` which we are leaving as default (False). We don't need to set it.\n\n Therefore, we return the above.\n\n But wait: the user also mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler'. So we are sure that the class 'AbstractCellHandler' exists? We are only asked for the signatures of two methods in that class.\n\n We proceed accordingly."}

What's the area of a square with a side of size 5 cm?\n 2. What is the weather in Queenstown Singapore?\n\n For the first part, we can use the function `get_area_of_square` with the parameter `size` set to 5.\n However, note that the function does not take units, but the question specifies 'cm'. Since the function only requires a float, we can use 5.0.\n\n For the second part, we can use the function `get_current_weather` with the parameter `location` set to \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n We are not given a unit for temperature, so we can use the default unit 'fahrenheit' or change it? But the user didn't specify. \n Since the function has a default, we can leave the unit as default or if we think the user might prefer Celsius (common in Singapore) we might set unit to 'celsius'. \n However, the function definition does not specify what units are allowed. Since the question does not specify, we can either:\n   a) Use the default (fahrenheit) and hope that's acceptable, or \n   b) Ask for clarification? But the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n      However, the unit is optional because it has a default. So we can call without unit.\n\n But note: the function definition says the location should be in the format of 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. \n We are using \"Queenstown, Singapore\", which is a neighborhood in Singapore. However, it's a valid location? \n We don't have control over the weather service, but we can only hope that the function can handle it.\n\n However, the instruction says: if we lack parameters, we point it out. Here, we have the required parameters for both functions.\n\n Therefore, we will make two function calls.\n\n But note: the instruction says to output in the format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\n We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one go? The problem says: \"at each turn\", and we are to continue until we have no more functions to call.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(...), func_name2(...)]\"\n\n So we can output both in one response.\n\n Let's write:\n   get_area_of_square(size=5.0)\n   get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\")\n\n But note: the function `get_current_weather` has an optional `unit` parameter. Since the user did not specify, we can either omit it (using the default) or set it to a unit we think is appropriate.\n\n Since the user is asking about Singapore, which uses Celsius, we might set unit='celsius'. However, the function's default is 'fahrenheit'. \n The problem says we are to use the functions as defined. We are allowed to set the unit? Yes, but the user didn't specify. \n\n We have two options:\n   Option 1: Use the default (fahrenheit) -> call without the unit parameter.\n   Option 2: Set unit to 'celsius' because that is the common unit in Singapore.\n\n How do we decide? The instruction does not specify. But note: the function has a default, so if we don't set it, it will use fahrenheit. \n The user might be expecting Celsius? But the user didn't specify.\n\n Since the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n The unit is not required because it has a default. So we are not forced to set it. However, we are allowed to set it if we think it's better.\n\n But the instruction also says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\n The purpose is to get the weather. Without specifying unit, we get fahrenheit. But in Singapore, weather reports are in Celsius. \n So to be more aligned with the user's expectation, we can set unit='celsius'. \n\n Alternatively, we can leave it to the function's default? But the function's default is fahrenheit. \n\n Given the ambiguity, and because the function allows the unit parameter, we can choose to set it to 'celsius' for this context.\n\n However, note that the function definition does not specify what values are allowed for `unit`. We assume it accepts 'celsius'. \n\n Therefore, we will call: \n   get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')\n\n But wait: the function definition says the location format is 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. \n We are using \"Queenstown, Singapore\" which is a neighborhood in the country of Singapore. \n However, there is a Queenstown in Singapore? Yes, it is a planning area in Singapore. \n But note: the function might not be able to resolve neighborhoods. We don't know the underlying implementation. \n The user asked for \"Queenstown Singapore\", so we are representing it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". \n If the function cannot handle it, that's beyond our control.\n\n Alternatively, we could use just \"Singapore\" for the location? But the user specifically said \"Queenstown Singapore\". \n So we should try to get the weather for Queenstown, Singapore.\n\n Therefore, we make the call as above.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to know the implementation, we just call the function with the parameters we have.\n\n So the two function calls are:\n   get_area_of_square(size=5.0)\n   get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')\n\n But note: the problem says to output in the format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\n We must output exactly in that format, with the parameters in the order of the function definition? \n The problem does not specify the order of parameters. But the function definitions have:\n   get_area_of_square: size\n   get_current_weather: location, unit (with unit being optional)\n\n So we can write:\n\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')]\n\n However, note: the problem says \"params_name1=params_value1, ...\". We are using named parameters, so the order does not matter.\n\n But to be safe, we can follow the order in the function definition.\n\n Alternatively, we can output each function call in a list. The problem says: [func_name1(...), func_name2(...)]\n\n So we write the entire response as:\n\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')]\n\n But note: the problem says \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format ...\". \n And we are invoking two.\n\n However, what if the functions are independent and we can call them in any order? We are calling both.\n\n Let's output that.\n\n But wait: the first function doesn't require a unit for the area? The area will be in square cm? \n The function `get_area_of_square` returns a number without unit. The user provided 5 cm, so the area will be 25 square cm? \n The function does not handle units, so we are just computing 5*5=25. The unit conversion is not part of the function. \n We are not asked to convert, so we just compute the number.\n\n Therefore, we are done."}

However, the search function (Services_1_FindProvider) is for finding a provider in a city, and the booking function (Services_1_BookAppointment) requires the stylist/salon name, time, and date.\n\n However, the booking does not require the city. So we can directly book if we have the salon name, time, and date.\n\n But wait: The user also asks to \"search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA\". This might be independent of the booking? Or perhaps the user wants to see options and then book one of them? However, the user specifically says \"and also book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon\". So the booking is for a specific salon.\n\n Therefore, we can break it down:\n\n Step 1: We are to search for hair stylists in Sunnyvale, CA. We don't have a preference for unisex, so we can use the default (dontcare). We call:\n   Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\", is_unisex='dontcare')\n\n But note: The function expects the city in the format \"City, State (abbr)\". The example is 'New York, NY'. So for Sunnyvale, CA, we should write \"Sunnyvale, CA\". However, the state abbreviation for California is CA, so that's correct.\n\n Step 2: We are to book an appointment at 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10. We call:\n   Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')\n\n However, note that the booking function requires the stylist_name.

But the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and we can output multiple function calls.\n\n So we do both.\n\n But note: The system will execute both? And the booking might fail if the salon is not found in the search? But the functions are independent. The booking function does not depend on the search. So we can do both.\n\n However, the user might have intended the search to be for the purpose of finding the salon? But they already specified the salon name for booking. So we do both.\n\n Alternatively, if the user wanted to book only if the salon is found in Sunnyvale? But that's not specified. We are just following the instructions.\n\n Since the user asked for two actions, we do both.\n\n Therefore, we return two function calls."}
