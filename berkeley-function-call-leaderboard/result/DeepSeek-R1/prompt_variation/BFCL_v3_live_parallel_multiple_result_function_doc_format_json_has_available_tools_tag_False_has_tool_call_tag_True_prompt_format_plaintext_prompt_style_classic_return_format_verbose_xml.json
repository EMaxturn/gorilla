We have to break down the steps and call the appropriate functions.\n\n Step 1: Clone the repository.\n   - We are given the repo URL: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n   - We'll use the `clone_repo` function. We don't have a destination specified, so we use the default (current directory). Also, we don't need recursive cloning or a shallow clone, so we leave those as default.\n\n Step 2: Analyse the contents of the repo and then create two things: a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - First, we need to analyse the repo to determine the language? But note: the `analyse_repo_contents` function only returns the predominant language. However, the instructions say to create/update dockerfile and kubernetes yamls \"based on the analysis\". But the functions we have for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not take the language as input. They only take the directory name.\n\n   Let's look at the functions:\n     - `create_a_docker_file`: only requires `directory_name`\n     - `create_kubernetes_yaml_file`: requires `directory_name` and optional parameters.\n\n   However, note that the `analyse_repo_contents` function might be needed to decide how to create the Dockerfile? But the function `create_a_docker_file` does not use the analysis result. It seems we are expected to run the analysis and then create the files in the same directory.\n\n   Since the problem says \"based on the analysis\", we must run the analysis first. But the creation functions don't require the analysis output. So we can do:\n     - Step 2.1: Run `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory to get the language? (But note: the function `create_a_docker_file` might internally use that analysis? Actually, no. The function `create_a_docker_file` is independent and only creates a Dockerfile. It doesn't take the language as input.)\n\n   However, the description of `create_a_docker_file` says: \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory to enable containerization of the application.\" It doesn't say it uses the analysis. So it's possible that the function is designed to work without the analysis.\n\n   Alternatively, the analysis step might be necessary for the user to know what language it is, but the functions we have for creating the files are generic? But note: the problem says to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis.\n\n   Since the functions we have do not take the language as input, we must assume that they are designed to work without it. Or perhaps the analysis step is not required for the creation? But the problem says to do step 2.1 and 2.2 based on the analysis.\n\n   However, the `analyse_repo_contents` function is provided and we are instructed to use it. So we will call it and then use the result? But note: the creation functions don't accept the language. Therefore, we have two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The `create_a_docker_file` function internally does the analysis? But the description doesn't say so.\n\n   Possibility 2: We are expected to use the analysis result to conditionally call different functions? But we don't have multiple functions for different languages.\n\n   Given the functions we have, I think we are to call the analysis function for informational purposes? But step 2.1 and 2.2 don't depend on it. Since the problem says \"based on the analysis\", we must run the analysis first. But the creation functions are fixed.\n\n   Therefore, we will:\n     - Run `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language (though we won't use it in the subsequent calls, but the problem says to do the analysis and then create the files based on that analysis). Maybe the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` are designed to use the analysis result from the context? But the function signatures don't show that.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the analysis function returns the predominant language. We don't have a function that creates a Dockerfile for a specific language. So we are forced to use the generic one.\n\n   Since the problem requires the analysis, we will run it. But we don't use the result in the next steps because we don't have a way to pass it. So we do:\n\n     Step 2: \n        - Call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory (which we just cloned). The directory name is the repository name? The repo is cloned from 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. The default destination is the current directory, so the repository will be in a folder named 'nodejs-welcome'. Therefore, the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n        - Then call `create_a_docker_file` with the same directory name.\n\n        - Then call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with the same directory name.\n\n   However, note that the step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile\". The function `create_a_docker_file` will create a Dockerfile. If one exists, it might overwrite? The description doesn't say. We assume it creates or updates appropriately.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes.\n   - We have a function `push_git_changes_to_github` that automatically does `git add` for all changes. So we don't need a separate step for adding. The function does: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\"\n\n Step 4: Commit and push to the repo.\n   - We use `push_git_changes_to_github` for this. We need to specify the directory name (the same repo directory), a commit message, and a branch. The problem doesn't specify the branch, so we use the default 'main'. The commit message is also not specified, so we use the default 'Update changes'. We are not told to force push, so we use default (false).\n\n Therefore, the sequence of function calls:\n\n   1. clone_repo with repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n   2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n   3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n   4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n   5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\n But note: the step 2.2 says \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis\". We are using the same directory name and default parameters for the Kubernetes YAML. The problem doesn't specify the deployment name, image name, replicas, port, or service type. So we use the defaults.\n\n However, note that the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has parameters with defaults. We are not provided with values, so we use the defaults.\n\n Important: The cloning step will create the directory 'nodejs-welcome'. We assume that the subsequent functions will use that same directory.\n\n Let's code the function calls accordingly.\n\n But note: the `clone_repo` function does not return the directory name. We know that the repository will be cloned into a directory named after the last part of the URL without the '.git'. So 'nodejs-welcome'. We can use that.\n\n However, what if the destination is provided? We are using the default, so it's the current directory and the folder will be 'nodejs-welcome'. So we are safe.\n\n Now, we output the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n We are going to make 5 function calls. We must put them in the <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n Format for each function:\n\n 1. clone_repo:\n      repo_url: string -> 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n      destination: string (optional, default '.') -> we can omit because we want the default.\n      recursive: boolean (default false) -> omit.\n      depth: integer (default None) -> omit.\n\n 2. analyse_repo_contents:\n      directory_name: string -> 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n 3. create_a_docker_file:\n      directory_name: string -> 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n 4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n      directory_name: string -> 'nodejs-welcome'\n      (all other parameters are optional and we use defaults)\n\n 5. push_git_changes_to_github:\n      directory_name: string -> 'nodejs-welcome'\n      commit_message: string (default) -> we can omit to use default.\n      branch_name: string (default) -> omit.\n      force_push: boolean (default false) -> omit.\n\n We must output all in one <TOOLCALL> block? But note: the system will execute the functions one by one. And the instructions say: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" and then the system will consider the turn complete.\n\n However, the problem says to do all the steps. We are outputting all the steps in one go? But note: the functions are independent and we are not using the output of one as input to the next? Actually, the analysis function returns the language, but we don't use it. So we can output all at once.\n\n But the system might require that we output one function at a time? The problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and \"Continue to output functions to call until ...\". It doesn't specify if we can output multiple in one turn.\n\n However, the example format in the problem shows multiple functions in one <TOOLCALL> block. So we can output multiple.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n     <function name=\"clone_repo\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"repo_url\" value=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n     </function>\n     <function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n     </function>\n     <function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n     </function>\n     <function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n     </function>\n     <function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n        </params>\n     </function>\n   </functions>\n </TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note that the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has more parameters, but they are optional and we are using defaults. So we don't need to include them.\n\n But wait: the step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". We are relying on the `push_git_changes_to_github` function to do the `git add` automatically. So we don't need a separate step.\n\n However, the problem says step 3: add, and step 4: commit/push. The `push_git_changes_to_github` function does both? The description says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" and then commit and push. So it does step 3 and 4 together.\n\n Therefore, we are covering all steps.\n\n But note: the problem says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then \"commit / push\" (step 4). We are doing both in one function. That is acceptable.\n\n One more thing: the order of the functions is critical. We must clone first, then analyse, then create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML, then push.\n\n We are outputting in that order.\n\n Therefore, we output the above."}

However, note that the function is described for Python, but we are in a Java context? \n   But the function description says: \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax.\" -> This might be a problem because the user is using Java.\n\n However, looking at the functions, we have:\n   get_relevant_classes: This function can be used to search for classes by a string. We are to search for classes related to 'CellResult'. \n     Parameters: \n        search_string: we can use 'CellResult'\n        include_subdirectories: the user says \"including subdirectories\", so set to True.\n\n   get_signature: This function retrieves the signature of a method in a class.

But the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\n But note: the functions we have might be generic enough? The function get_relevant_classes doesn't specify language. \n   We can try to use it to search for Java classes? The description says: \"Retrieves a list of class names from the repository\".\n\n So, let's assume that the repository contains Java code and the tool can handle it.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For the first part: Find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository including subdirectories.\n    We can use: get_relevant_classes\n        search_string: 'CellResult'\n        include_subdirectories: True (because the user said including subdirectories)\n        case_sensitive: We don't know, but the error message is case sensitive? The error says 'getNumericValue' and the method name in Java is case sensitive.\n        However, the search is for the class name, not the method. The class name is 'CellResult'. We can set case_sensitive to false to be safe? \n        But the user might have a class named exactly 'CellResult'. Let's set case_sensitive to false to capture variations? \n\n    Alternatively, we might want to set case_sensitive to true because Java class names are typically in CamelCase and we are looking for exact match?\n    But the function description says: \"By default, the search is not case sensitive.\" and the user didn't specify, so we can leave it as default (false) or set to true?\n\n    Since the error is about a specific class name, and in Java class names are case sensitive, we should set case_sensitive to true? \n    However, the function's default is false. We can override? The user didn't specify, so we can use false to be safe? \n\n    Actually, the error says: \"method 'getNumericValue()' cannot be found in 'CellResult'\". So the class name is given as 'CellResult'. \n    We are to find classes that are related to 'CellResult'. We are not limited to exactly that name? The function get_relevant_classes says: \n        \"Retrieves a list of class names from the repository that potentially match the provided search criteria.\"\n\n    So we are searching for the string 'CellResult'. We can set case_sensitive to false to catch if there are any case variations? \n    But in Java, the class name must be exactly as defined. So if the class is named 'CellResult', then we want that. \n\n    However, the function might return classes that have the string 'CellResult' in their name? So we can set case_sensitive to false to be safe? \n    Let's set it to false? But note: the user might have a class named 'cellresult' (all lowercase) which is different. \n\n    Alternatively, we can set case_sensitive to true because the error message uses 'CellResult'. \n\n    Since the function allows us to set it, and we are not sure, we can set it to true? \n\n    But the function's default is false. We can set:\n\n        case_sensitive: true   (because the class name in the error is given as 'CellResult', so we want to match exactly that case? \n        but the function might be doing substring matching? We don't know. The description says: \"filter relevant classes\", so it might be substring.\n\n    We are not given details. So let's stick with the default (false) but set include_subdirectories to true.\n\n    So: \n        function: get_relevant_classes\n        parameters:\n            search_string: \"CellResult\"\n            case_sensitive: false (default) -> we don't need to set because default is false.\n            include_subdirectories: true\n\n 2. For the second part: Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n    We can use get_signature? But note: the function get_signature is for a method in a class. \n    However, the function is described for Python? But the user is in Java.\n\n    We have to note that the function might not work for Java? But the problem says: if the function cannot be used, point it out. \n    But we are only allowed to return function calls? \n\n    Alternatively, we have get_class_info which can retrieve information about the class, and that might include the methods? \n    But again, it is described for Python.\n\n    Since the tool set does not have a function specifically for Java, and the available functions are described for Python, we might be unable to get Java method signatures? \n\n    However, the problem does not specify the language of the repository? The user says it's a Java project, but the functions we have might be language-agnostic? \n    The function get_signature has a parameter for class_name and method_name, and it doesn't specify the language. \n\n    We can try to use it? \n\n    But note: the function get_class_info has a parameter 'module_name' which is Python specific? \n\n    How about we use get_class_info for the class 'AbstractCellHandler'? We don't know the module (package in Java) so we leave module_name as default (None)? \n    The function might work by searching the entire repository? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use get_relevant_classes to find the exact class name? But we are already using it for 'CellResult'. \n\n    Since the user specifically asks for the signatures of two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler', we can try:\n\n        First, we need to get the class info for 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can call:\n            get_class_info(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', include_private=False)\n\n        Then, from the result, we might be able to see the methods? But the function get_class_info returns the methods and properties? \n\n        However, the function get_signature is for getting the signature of a specific method. We don't know if the class info from get_class_info includes the signatures? \n\n        The description of get_class_info says: \"Retrieves information about the methods, properties, and constructor of a specified class\". \n        It doesn't specify the level of detail. We are interested in the signatures of the methods.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use get_signature for each method? \n\n    We are going to do:\n\n        For 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler', we can call get_signature twice.\n\n        But note: the function get_signature requires the class_name and method_name.\n\n        So we can call:\n            get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue')\n            get_signature(class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue')\n\n    However, we are not sure if the function supports Java? But the tool description does not restrict the language? \n\n    We must try? \n\n    But note: the function get_imports has a 'language' parameter, but get_signature does not. So it might be that get_signature is language-agnostic? \n\n    We are going to assume that the tool can handle Java.\n\n    However, the user might have multiple classes with the same name in different packages? We don't have a way to specify the package? \n\n    The function get_class_info has an optional 'module_name' (which in Java could be the package). But we don't know the package. \n\n    We are not given the package of 'AbstractCellHandler'. \n\n    We have to rely on the tool to find the class? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use get_relevant_classes to find the exact class? But we are already doing a search for 'CellResult'. \n\n    We are not asked to search for 'AbstractCellHandler'? We are just asked for the signatures of two methods in that class.\n\n    We can try without the module/package? \n\n    So, we will make three function calls:\n\n        get_relevant_classes for 'CellResult' with include_subdirectories=True\n        get_signature for class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='setCellValue'\n        get_signature for class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue'\n\n    We set include_private to false for both because we are not interested in private methods? The user is overriding these methods, so they are public.\n\n    However, note: the function get_signature has a parameter 'include_private' which by default is false. We don't need to set it.\n\n    But wait: the method names we are providing are public? So it should be found.\n\n    But what if the method is private? Then it wouldn't be overridden. So we are safe.\n\n    So, let's write the function calls.\n\n    However, note: the user is in Java, and the method names are in camelCase? The user provided: 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. \n\n    We are using exactly those names.\n\n    But note: the error is about a method named 'getNumericValue' in the class 'CellResult'. We are not asked to get the signature for that? \n    We are only asked for the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\n    So, we output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>\n            <functions>\n                <function name=\"get_relevant_classes\">\n                    <params>\n                        <param name=\"search_string\" value=\"CellResult\" type=\"string\"/>\n                        <param name=\"include_subdirectories\" value=\"true\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n                    </params>\n                </function>\n                <function name=\"get_signature\">\n                    <params>\n                        <param name=\"class_name\" value=\"AbstractCellHandler\" type=\"string\"/>\n                        <param name=\"method_name\" value=\"setCellValue\" type=\"string\"/>\n                    </params>\n                </function>\n                <function name=\"get_signature\">\n                    <params>\n                        <param name=\"class_name\" value=\"AbstractCellHandler\" type=\"string\"/>\n                        <param name=\"method_name\" value=\"getCellValue\" type=\"string\"/>\n                    </params>\n                </function>\n            </functions>\n        </TOOLCALL>\n\n    However, note that the function get_signature does not have a parameter for the module? We are relying on the tool to find the class.\n\n    But if there are multiple classes named 'AbstractCellHandler' in the repository, we might get the wrong one? \n\n    We don't have a way to specify the package. So we must hope that the tool can resolve the correct one? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use get_class_info to get the class and then from there get the methods? But the function get_class_info might return the methods without the full signature? \n\n    The description of get_class_info says it returns information about the methods, but not necessarily the signature? \n\n    The function get_signature is specifically for the signature.\n\n    So we choose get_signature.\n\n    But note: the function get_class_info might be more efficient because we get all methods at once? But we are only interested in two methods.\n\n    However, the user asked for the signatures of two specific methods.\n\n    We'll proceed with the above.\n\n    However, the function get_relevant_classes returns a list of class names, but we are not using that result to inform the get_signature calls? \n    We are using the class name 'AbstractCellHandler' directly.\n\n    That's acceptable because the user provided the class name.\n\n    Let's write the function calls accordingly.\n\n    Note: The function get_relevant_classes does not require the other parameters (case_sensitive and include_subdirectories) to be set if we are using the default? \n    But we want to set include_subdirectories to true. We don't set case_sensitive because the default is false, which is acceptable.\n\n    We are setting:\n        get_relevant_classes: \n            search_string: \"CellResult\" (string)\n            include_subdirectories: true (boolean)\n\n        get_signature (for setCellValue):\n            class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\" (string)\n            method_name: \"setCellValue\" (string)\n\n        get_signature (for getCellValue):\n            class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\" (string)\n            method_name: \"getCellValue\" (string)\n\n    We do not set 'include_private' because it defaults to false.\n\n    Now, note: the user also mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler'. So the methods are in the superclass.\n\n    We are getting the signatures from the superclass? Yes.\n\n    We are done.\n\n    But wait: the user might have multiple methods named 'setCellValue' (overloaded) in the class? We are not specifying which one? \n    The function get_signature might return the first one? Or it might return an error? We don't know.\n\n    We have to assume that the function will return the signature of the method that is being overridden? \n\n    Alternatively, we might need to get all methods and then filter? But the function get_signature takes a method_name. \n\n    We are calling with the exact name provided by the user.\n\n    We hope that the tool can handle it.\n\n    We output the function calls as above."}

Calculate the area of a square with a side of size 5 cm.\n2. Get the weather in Queenstown, Singapore.\n\nWe have two functions available:\n- get_area_of_square: which requires a parameter \"size\" (float) for the side length.\n- get_current_weather: which requires a parameter \"location\" (string) and optionally \"unit\" (string, enum: ['celsius','fahrenheit']).\n\nFor the first task, we note that the function get_area_of_square expects a float for the side length. The query says \"5 cm\", but the function does not require the unit (it just calculates the area in square units of the input). So we can pass 5.0 as the size. However, note that the function returns the area without units, so the unit of the area will be square cm. But that is acceptable.\n\nFor the second task, we need to get the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The location should be formatted as \"City, State\" or \"City, Country\". Since Queenstown is a district in Singapore, we can use \"Queenstown, Singapore\". Alternatively, note that the example includes \"San Francisco, CA\" and \"Paris, France\". So we can use \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\nWe are going to make two function calls.\n\nFirst function call:\n  name: get_area_of_square\n  parameters:\n    size: 5.0   (type: float)\n\nSecond function call:\n  name: get_current_weather\n  parameters:\n    location: \"Queenstown, Singapore\" (type: string)\n    unit: we are not specified, so we can use the default (fahrenheit). But the user did not specify a unit. However, since the user is in Singapore, they might expect celsius. But the function has a default of fahrenheit. We can choose to use the default or change to celsius. Since the user did not specify, we can leave it to default. But note: the function will use fahrenheit by default. Alternatively, we can use celsius because Singapore uses metric. However, the problem says if the parameters are not provided, we cannot invent them. The function has a default, so we can omit the unit and it will use fahrenheit. But the user didn't specify, so we must stick to the function's default? Or we can set unit to 'celsius' because it's more appropriate? \n\nLooking at the function definition: the unit is optional and has a default of 'fahrenheit'. But the user's location is Singapore, which uses celsius. However, the user did not specify. We have two options:\n  a) Do not include the unit parameter -> defaults to fahrenheit.\n  b) Set unit to 'celsius' because it's more common in Singapore.\n\nBut note: the instruction says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" and we are allowed to use the optional parameters. The function allows unit to be set. Since the user didn't specify, we are free to choose? Actually, the instruction doesn't say we must use the default if the user doesn't specify. However, the function has a default so we can rely on that. But to be more user-friendly, we might want to use celsius for Singapore.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output the function calls exactly as per the parameters. Since the function allows unit and we have the freedom to set it, and given that Singapore uses celsius, I think it's better to set unit to 'celsius'. However, the problem does not require us to make that inference. Alternatively, we can leave it to the default? \n\nBut note: the function's description says it returns the weather. The user didn't specify the unit, so we can use the default. However, the examples in the function description do not specify the unit either. So we can just use the default. But let me check: the function's parameter for unit has a default of 'fahrenheit'. So if we omit it, it will be fahrenheit.\n\nAlternatively, we can ask: should we set the unit to what is locally used? But the function doesn't have that intelligence. We are only allowed to use the provided functions. So we must choose one.\n\nGiven that the user did not specify, we can output the call without the unit parameter and let the function use the default. But if we do that, the weather will be in fahrenheit and the user in Singapore might not be used to that. Alternatively, we can set it to celsius. However, the problem does not specify. \n\nConsidering the instruction: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" - the unit is not required. So we are not forced to set it. But we are allowed to set it if we want? Actually, we are free to set optional parameters. \n\nI think the best practice is to use the unit that is common in the location. Since Singapore uses celsius, we will set unit='celsius'. \n\nBut note: the function call must be in the format. We are going to set the unit to 'celsius'.\n\nSo second function call parameters:\n  location: \"Queenstown, Singapore\"\n  unit: \"celsius\"\n\nHowever, the function's enum for unit is in lower case: ['celsius','fahrenheit']. So we use 'celsius'.\n\nBut wait: the user asked for \"Queenstown Singapore\". Note that Queenstown is a district in Singapore. It might be better to use the city as Singapore? But the function expects a location string. We are using \"Queenstown, Singapore\" which should be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we will make two function calls.\n\nLet's write the function calls in the required XML format.\n\nFirst function call:\n  <function name=\"get_area_of_square\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"size\" value=\"5.0\" type=\"float\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n\nSecond function call:\n  <function name=\"get_current_weather\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"location\" value=\"Queenstown, Singapore\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"unit\" value=\"celsius\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n\nNote: the value for size is 5.0 (a float). The value for location is a string, and unit is a string.\n\nWe put both in the same TOOLCALL block.\n\nHowever, note: the instruction says we can make multiple function calls in the same TOOLCALL by having multiple <function> tags.\n\nSo the entire response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"get_area_of_square\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"size\" value=\"5.0\" type=\"float\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n<function name=\"get_current_weather\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"Queenstown, Singapore\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"unit\" value=\"celsius\" type=\"string\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nBut note: the unit parameter is optional. We are including it because we decided to use celsius. Alternatively, we could have omitted it and let it default to fahrenheit? But we chose to set it to celsius. This is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we could have made two separate TOOLCALLs? But the instruction says we can put multiple function calls in the same TOOLCALL block.\n\nSo we are good."}

Actually, the booking function does not require the city. \n However, the first function (FindProvider) is to search for a stylist in a city. The user is asking to search in Sunnyvale, CA and then book with a specific salon.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can first search for the salon in Sunnyvale, CA to make sure it exists? But note the booking function doesn't require the city. \n    The user specifically asked to book with 'Elegant Styles' at a given time and date. We can directly book without searching? \n    However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n    The booking function requires: stylist_name, appointment_time, appointment_date.

We should do that as well.\n\n However, note that the user might be implying that we should search for 'Elegant Styles' in Sunnyvale? But the booking is independent.\n\n But let's break down:\n   - The first part: \"Could you search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA\" -> this is a general search without a specific stylist name? \n     The function FindProvider doesn't take a stylist name, only city and unisex flag.\n\n   - The second part: \"and also book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon for me at 15:00 on 2023-05-10\"\n\n So we have two separate actions.\n\n We can do:\n   Step 1: Call FindProvider for Sunnyvale, CA (city: \"Sunnyvale, CA\") with is_unisex defaulting to 'dontcare'\n   Step 2: Call BookAppointment with the provided details.\n\n However, note that the booking function requires the stylist_name. The user provided 'Elegant Styles'. But is that the stylist or the salon? \n The parameter description says: \"The full name of the hair stylist or the name of the salon.\" So we can use the salon name.\n\n But wait, the search function (FindProvider) returns a list of providers? We don't have a function to get availability. \n The booking function doesn't check availability? It just books. So we can book without checking? \n\n However, the problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n We are going to make two function calls.\n\n But note: the user might want to verify that 'Elegant Styles' is in Sunnyvale? The booking function doesn't take location. \n So we are just booking by name. But the user's request includes both the search and the booking.\n\n We'll do both.\n\n However, the search function doesn't take a specific name. So we can't search for 'Elegant Styles' by name? \n The function only takes city and unisex flag. So we can only get a list of salons in Sunnyvale? \n\n The user didn't ask for a specific stylist in the search, just a general search? Then why do we need to search? \n The user said: \"search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA\" and then book with a specific salon. \n\n We can interpret that as two separate requests.\n\n Let's do:\n   Function call 1: Services_1_FindProvider for Sunnyvale, CA (with is_unisex='dontcare')\n   Function call 2: Services_1_BookAppointment for 'Elegant Styles' at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\n But note: the booking might require the stylist's full name? The user provided the salon name. \n The parameter says: stylist_name can be the salon name. So we are safe.\n\n However, what if the booking function requires the stylist's name and we only have the salon? \n The description says: \"The full name of the hair stylist or the name of the salon.\" So we can use the salon name.\n\n Therefore, we can make the two calls.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n We have all parameters for both functions.\n\n For Services_1_FindProvider:\n   Required: city -> we have \"Sunnyvale, CA\"\n   Optional: is_unisex -> we don't have a preference, so we use the default 'dontcare'\n\n For Services_1_BookAppointment:\n   Required: \n        stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\"\n        appointment_time: \"15:00\"\n        appointment_date: \"2023-05-10\"\n\n We are good.\n\n However, note that the state in the city for FindProvider should be in short form. The user said \"Sunnyvale, CA\", which is short for California. So that's acceptable.\n\n Let's write the function calls in the required format.\n\n Important: The type for the parameters must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, tuple.\n\n For the FindProvider function, the parameter 'is_unisex' is an enum with values as strings? But note the default is given as a string. \n However, the function definition in the parameters says: \n        \"is_unisex\": {\n          \"type\": \"boolean\",\n          ... \n          \"enum\": [\"True\", \"False\", \"dontcare\"],\n          \"default\": \"dontcare\"\n        }\n\n But note: the type is specified as boolean? But the enum has string values? This might be a mistake in the function definition. \n However, we must follow the given function definition. Since the enum values are strings, we must pass a string.\n\n But wait, the type is boolean? That doesn't match. However, we are instructed to use the provided function definitions. \n The function expects a string from the set {\"True\", \"False\", \"dontcare\"}? Actually, the type might be string? But the function definition says \"boolean\". \n\n Looking at the function definition again: \n      {'name': 'Services_1_FindProvider', ... \n        'parameters': {\n          ... \n          'properties': {\n            'city': {'type': 'string', ...},\n            'is_unisex': {'type': 'boolean', ...}   <--- This says type is boolean.\n\n However, the enum values are strings? There is a conflict. But the problem says: we must use the function as defined.\n\n Since the enum is provided and the default is a string, and the type is specified as boolean, we must decide.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n We are told to set the type. For the 'is_unisex' parameter, the function definition says the type is boolean? \n However, the allowed values are strings? This is confusing.\n\n Let me reexamine the function definition:\n\n        \"is_unisex\": {\n          \"type\": \"boolean\",\n          \"description\": ...,\n          \"enum\": [\"True\", \"False\", \"dontcare\"],\n          \"default\": \"dontcare\"\n        }\n\n This seems inconsistent because a boolean in JSON is true/false (without quotes) and not strings. Also, there is a third value \"dontcare\" which is not a boolean.\n\n Therefore, I suspect there might be an error in the function definition. But we are to use it as given.\n\n How to resolve? \n The problem says: we must use the function as defined. The function expects a boolean? But the enum has string values. \n\n Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: ...\". \n So when we write the function call, we set the type of the parameter to what the function expects? \n\n The function expects a boolean? But the enum includes non-boolean. This is a problem.\n\n However, looking at the description: \n        \"Flag indicating if the salon is unisex. True for unisex, False for gender-specific, or dontcare for no preference.\"\n\n So it's not a pure boolean. We have three states.\n\n Given the function definition, we have to pass one of the strings: \"True\", \"False\", \"dontcare\". \n But the type in the function call should be set to string? Because we are passing a string.\n\n But the function definition says the type is boolean? That might be a mistake in the function definition.\n\n Since we are to use the function as defined, and the function requires one of those three string values, we will set the type to string? \n However, the function definition says the type is boolean. \n\n This is a conflict. But note: the problem says \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple\". \n\n We are going to pass a string? But the function definition says boolean? \n\n How about we look at the function name: Services_1_FindProvider. The parameter is_unisex is defined as:\n\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n\n But then the enum is given as an array of strings. This is not standard. \n\n Given the ambiguity, we should follow the function definition as closely as possible. \n Since the function expects one of the enum values, and they are strings, we will pass a string. \n But the function definition says the type is boolean? We are in a dilemma.\n\n However, note that the function call format we are to use has a 'type' attribute for each parameter. \n We are instructed to set the type to one of the allowed types. \n\n The function definition says the parameter is of type boolean? Then we should set type=\"boolean\". \n But then the value must be a boolean? But the enum values are strings? \n\n We must pass the value as a boolean? But the enum includes \"dontcare\", which is not a boolean. \n\n This function definition is flawed.\n\n Given the instructions, I think we have to pass the string as a string? Because the function definition also includes an enum of strings? \n\n Alternatively, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n But we have the parameter? \n\n However, we are not pointing out flaws in the function definition. We are to use it.\n\n Since the function definition says the type is boolean but the enum has strings and a non-boolean value, we have to make a choice.\n\n Let me look at the other function: BookAppointment has parameters of type string and they are passed as strings.\n\n I think the function definition for FindProvider might have intended the type of is_unisex to be string? \n\n But the problem says: we are given the functions in json format. We must use them as given.\n\n How about we pass the value as a string? And set the type to string? \n But the function definition says the type is boolean? \n\n Alternatively, we can pass the value as a string and set the type to string, but that would violate the function definition? \n\n The problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: ...\". \n It doesn't say we must match the function's defined type? It says we set the type in the function call to one of those.\n\n But note: the function call format we are to use is:\n\n      <param name=\"is_unisex\" value=\"dontcare\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n\n But then the value is a string? That doesn't match.\n\n We are stuck.\n\n Given the instructions, I think we must follow the function definition. \n The function says the type is boolean? Then we must pass a boolean value? \n But we have three states: true, false, and dontcare (which is not a boolean). \n\n This function is broken.\n\n Since we are not allowed to point out issues in the function definition unless the parameters are missing, and the parameters are not missing, we have to do something.\n\n We have two options:\n   Option 1: Skip the is_unisex parameter and use the default? Because it is optional and has a default. \n   Option 2: Pass the value as a string and set the type to string? \n\n But the problem says: we must set the type to one of the allowed types. We are allowed to set it to string. \n\n However, the function expects a boolean? That might cause an error. \n\n Given the ambiguity, I will choose to omit the is_unisex parameter because it is optional and has a default. \n Then the function call will use the default value \"dontcare\". \n\n How? The function definition says the parameter is_unisex is not required? The required parameters are only ['city'].\n\n So we can omit it.\n\n Therefore, we will only pass the city.\n\n So for FindProvider:\n   city: \"Sunnyvale, CA\" (type string)\n\n For BookAppointment:\n   stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\" (string)\n   appointment_time: \"15:00\" (string)\n   appointment_date: \"2023-05-10\" (string)\n\n Now, let's write the function calls."}
