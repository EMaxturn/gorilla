So, after loading the data, I need to extract these columns.\n\nHowever, the functions don't directly handle data manipulation like extracting columns. **data_loading** will load the data into a structure, probably a pandas DataFrame or similar, since it's Python 3 syntax.\n\nIn my response, I can only make function calls.

Probably not, as per the tools.\n\nPerhaps I need to point out that I need the data first.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor **linear_regression_fit**, it lacks x and y, so I need to load first.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nFinal decision: Call **data_loading** first."}

It requires 'ingredients' (a list) and 'calories'. Optionally, 'meal' like breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\n- **ingredient_replace**: Replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute and ensures calories stay under a limit. It requires 'original_ingredient', 'replacement_ingredient', and 'calories'.\n\n- **restaurant_search**: Searches for restaurants based on ingredients and max calories. It requires 'ingredients' and 'calories'. Optionally, 'meal'.\n\nMapping to the user's requests:\n\n1. For breakfast: This matches **recipe_search**.

Ingredients: ['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories: 500, and meal: 'lunch'.\n\n3. For dinner: This matches **ingredient_replace**. Original ingredient: 'beef', replacement: 'tofu', calories: 600. However, the function requires a specific recipe to modify, but the user didn't provide one. The function description says: \"Replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute...\" But in the parameters, it only lists 'original_ingredient', 'replacement_ingredient', and 'calories'. It doesn't explicitly require a full recipe as input. Looking back: \"Replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute, keeping the calories below a certain number.\" The function might assume it knows the recipe, but based on the parameters, it only takes those three. I need to call it with what's available.\n\nThe function is described as: \"Replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute...\" but the parameters don't include a recipe identifier. This might mean the function handles it internally, perhaps by searching first or assuming context. But in the tool description, it's standalone. The user says: \"I have a recipe for dinner that uses beef\", but they didn't provide details. I might need to first search for a recipe that uses beef, then replace it.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" For ingredient_replace, it requires 'original_ingredient', 'replacement_ingredient', and 'calories'. The user provided those: original: beef, replacement: tofu, calories: 600. So, technically, I can call it.\n\nTo be precise, the function might need a recipe to work on, but since it's not specified in parameters, I'll assume I can call it as is.\n\nI need to make function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section, and I can make multiple in one go if needed.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.
