The only function is 'currency_conversion.convert', which takes three parameters: amount, from_currency, and to_currency.\n\n- Amount: The user specified 150, which is an integer.\n\n- From_currency: The user said \"Euros\", so that should be \"EUR\" (standard currency code).\n\n- To_currency: The user said \"Canadian dollars\", so that should be \"CAD\".\n\nThe function description says it's for converting a value from one currency to another, and it matches perfectly.\n\nI need to format my response as a function call enclosed in <TOOLCALL> tags. The exact format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, it would be: <TOOLCALL>[currency_conversion.convert(amount=150, from_currency='EUR', to_currency='CAD')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nIs \"Euros\" exactly 'EUR'?
