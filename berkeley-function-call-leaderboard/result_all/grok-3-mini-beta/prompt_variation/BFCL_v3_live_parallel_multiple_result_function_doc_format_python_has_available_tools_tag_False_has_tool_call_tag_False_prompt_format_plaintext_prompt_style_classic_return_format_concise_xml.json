The relevant one is \"get_current_weather\", which takes:\n\n- location (str): Like 'City, State' or 'City, Country'.\n\n- unit (str, default='metric'): So, I can specify 'metric'.\n\nThe user mentioned two locations: Guangzhou and Beijing. But the function only takes one location per call. I might need to call this function twice, once for each city.\n\nThe function description: \"Retrieves the current weather conditions for a specified location\". It seems designed for one location at a time.\n\nIn my response, I have to use the exact format for function calls. I can make multiple function calls in one response by including multiple <function> tags inside <functions>.\n\nSo, I should call \"get_current_weather\" for Guangzhou first, then for Beijing, both with unit='metric'.\n\nHow to format the locations: The example is 'Berkeley, CA' or 'London, UK'. For China, it might be 'Guangzhou, China' and 'Beijing, China'.\n\nThe user said \"\u4e2d\u56fd\u5e7f\u5dde\u5e02\u548c\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\", which translates to \"Guangzhou and Beijing in China\".

Let me translate it:\n\n- \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\" means \"Living room, Air conditioner, Execute\" or \"Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\"\n\n- \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\" means \"Bedroom, Air purifier, Stop it\" or \"Turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\"\n\nSo, the user wants to control two appliances: turn on the air conditioner in the living room and turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, the one that matches this is: ControlAppliance.execute\n\nThis function is for controlling home appliances. Its description says:\n\n- The command must be in Korean.\n\n- It consists of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\n\n- Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- Another example: '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine.\n\nThe user has two separate commands in one sentence. I need to handle both.\n\nThe function takes a single command string. So, for each command, I might need to make a separate function call.\n\nThe function call format allows me to make multiple function calls in one response, as shown: <functions><function>...</function><function>...</function></functions>\n\nI should call ControlAppliance.execute twice: once for each command.\n\nFirst command: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nThis matches the example directly.\n\nSecond command: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nThis seems straightforward too.\n\nI need to ensure the format is exact. The function's arg is: command (str) - in Korean, with room, appliance, and operation separated by commas.\n\nOther functions like OpenWeatherMap, HNA_WQA, etc., are not relevant here.\n\nSo, my response should only contain the function calls.\n\nFormat: <functions><function name=\"ControlAppliance.execute\"><param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">value</param></function>...</functions>\n\nFor the first one:\n\n<function name=\"ControlAppliance.execute\"><param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589</param></function>\n\nFor the second:\n\n<function name=\"ControlAppliance.execute\"><param name=\"command\" type=\"string\">\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0</param></function>\n\nWrap them in <functions> and </functions>.\n\nThe user said \"\uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0, ... \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\", which might imply \"execute and then stop\", but I think it's just two separate actions.\n\nI should make sure that the commands are exactly as specified. In the function description, it says for control commands, it must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start', but in the args, it's in Korean, and the example uses '\uc2e4\ud589' which probably means 'execute' or 'start'.\n\nThe description says: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nIt says 'power on' or 'start', but in the examples, it's in Korean: '\uc2e4\ud589' and '\uc911\uc9c0'.\n\nLooking closely: \"the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'.\" But the examples are in Korean. This might be a inconsistency, but since the function description specifies the command in Korean, I'll assume '\uc2e4\ud589' is acceptable as per the examples.\n\nProceed with the calls.\n\nFinal response: Two function calls inside <functions>."}

So, I need to use that.\n\n- For information on the Imjin War: This seems like a historical topic, but the user wants \"up-to-date information.\" The functions available are HNA_WQA.search for general web searches and HNA_NEWS.search for news. Since it's about a historical event, it might not have \"up-to-date\" news, but I'll use HNA_WQA.search as it's for topics that change frequently.

I need to include one or more <function> tags inside <functions>.\n\nSince I have two functions to call, I'll include both in my response.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"func_name2\">\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nFor get_aws_pricing:\n\n- name: \"get_aws_pricing\"\n\n- params: memory (int) with value 4\n\n- params: cpu (int) with value 2\n\nFor get_gcp_pricing:\n\n- name: \"get_gcp_pricing\"\n\n- params: memory_gb (int) with value 4\n\n- params: cpu_count (int) with value 2\n\n- I won't specify region or usage_type since they have defaults.\n\nThe user asked for \"all clouds,\" and I only have these two, so I'll proceed with calling both.\n\nAfter calling these, I might need to handle the results, but according to the instructions, I should just output the function calls, and the system will handle the rest.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

Clone the repo: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n\n2. Analyze the contents of the repo.\n\n3. Based on the analysis:\n\n   - Create or update a Dockerfile.\n\n   - Create Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n4. Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n5. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to map these steps to the available functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This matches step 1. It takes repo_url, and optionally destination, recursive, and depth.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It takes directory_name.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It takes directory_name.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It takes directory_name, and other optional params.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 4 and 5, but it also handles adding changes automatically as per its description: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\"\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\"\n\nSo, for step 3 (add all changed files) and step 4 (commit/push), I can use this function, as it will handle adding, committing, and pushing.\n\nThe sequence I need to follow:\n\n1. First, call clone_repo with the given URL.\n\n2. After cloning, call analyse_repo_contents on the cloned directory.\n\n3. Then, based on the analysis, call create_a_docker_file.\n\n4. Next, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n5. Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github to add, commit, and push the changes.\n\nThe functions don't directly depend on the output of analyse_repo_contents. For example, create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file don't take analysis results as input. In a real system, the analysis might inform how to create those files, but based on the available functions, I have to call them sequentially.\n\nThe user said: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following. 2.1 create/update dockerfile based on the analysis. 2.2 kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nHowever, the functions don't explicitly take analysis as input. I need to assume that after calling analyse_repo_contents, the next functions will use that information implicitly, or perhaps in this setup, I just call them in order.\n\nIn my response, I need to output function calls one after another if needed. The instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I should output all necessary function calls in this response.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. clone_repo: repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n   - Destination: default is '.', which is fine.\n\n   - Other params: not specified, so use defaults.\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents: directory_name \u2013 after cloning, the directory name would be the repo name, probably 'nodejs-welcome' or whatever the default is. The function description says: \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\n   For clone_repo, if destination is '.', it clones into the current directory, probably creating a subdirectory with the repo name. So, I should use 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory_name.\n\n3. create_a_docker_file: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome', and other params can use defaults.\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message can be default or something appropriate, branch_name default 'main', etc.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 3.\n\nI need to format this as XML-like structure for multiple functions.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<param name=\"param1\" type=\"string\">value1</param>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"func_name2\">\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nI need to specify the type for each param, like string, int, etc.\n\nLet me specify the parameters:\n\nFor clone_repo:\n\n- repo_url: string, 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n- destination: string, default '.', so omit.\n\n- recursive: boolean, default False, omit.\n\n- depth: int, default full, omit.\n\nFor analyse_repo_contents:\n\n- directory_name: string, 'nodejs-welcome'\n\nFor create_a_docker_file:\n\n- directory_name: string, 'nodejs-welcome'\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n\n- directory_name: string, 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- deployment_name: string, default if not provided. The user didn't specify, so use default.\n\n- image_name: string, default 'latest'\n\n- replicas: int, default 1\n\n- port: int, default 80\n\n- service_type: string, default 'ClusterIP'\n\nSo, I can just use the defaults by not specifying them.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github:\n\n- directory_name: string, 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- commit_message: string, default 'Update changes', or I could use something like 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML'\n\n- branch_name: string, default 'main'\n\n- force_push: boolean, default False\n\nI am considering using a custom commit message, like 'Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes files based on analysis'.\n\nIn the response, I need to output all these function calls in one go, since I'm to complete as much as possible in the current turn.\n\nSo, my response should be a single <functions> block with multiple <function> elements inside.\n\nFinally, ensure the types are correct: string for URLs and names, int for numbers, boolean for flags."}

The function for that is `recall_memory_search`. It searches the prior conversation history for a specified string.\n\n   - I can use `query` as something like \"Shishir's birthday\" to search for it.\n\n2. **Congratulate him:** Once I have the information, I need to send a message. The function for sending a message is `send_message`.\n\n   - The message should be 'Happy Birthday!' to Shishir.\n\nThe user says \"regardless,\" which means I should send the message even if I don't find the birthday. So, I need to handle both cases.\n\nIn my response, I should only return function calls in the specified format.

Then, in a subsequent turn, I might act on those results.\n\nIn this setup, I have to output functions in this response, and the system will handle the execution.\n\nThe user request has two parts: search and then send a message regardless.\n\nTo send the message regardless, I could call both functions in sequence in this response.\n\nThe format allows multiple functions: <functions><function>...</function><function>...</function></functions>\n\nSo, I can call `recall_memory_search` first, and then `send_message`.\n\nIf I call `recall_memory_search` with `request_heartbeat=true`, it might allow for follow-up, but I need to send the message anyway.\n\nThe safest is to call both: first search, then send the message.\n\nFor `send_message`, I need parameters: message, recipient, and urgent.\n\nThe user didn't specify the recipient. In the function, recipient defaults to 'default@example.com', but for Shishir, I should use something like 'Shishir'. The function description says: \"The identifier of the recipient. This could be a username, phone number, or an email address.\"\n\nThe user implies Shishir is the recipient, so I'll assume it's 'Shishir' or something. But in the function, it's a string, so I can set it to 'Shishir'.\n\nIf I don't know, I should point it out, but the prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor `send_message`, recipient is optional with a default, so maybe it's okay.\n\nTo be precise, let's check: Args: recipient (str, default='default@example.com')\n\nIt has a default, so I can omit it or use it.\n\nFor the query in `recall_memory_search`, I need a string like \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nThen, for sending the message: message = \"Happy Birthday!\"\n\nRecipient: let's use \"Shishir\" as the identifier.\n\nUrgent: default False, so no need to set.\n\nSo, my plan: Call `recall_memory_search` with query=\"Shishir's birthday\", and then call `send_message` with message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"Shishir\".\n\nThat way, I'm searching and then sending regardless.\n\nFinally, format it correctly.\n\nResponse format:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"recall_memory_search\">\n\n<param name=\"query\" type=\"string\">Shishir's birthday</param>\n\n<param name=\"request_heartbeat\" type=\"boolean\">true</param>  // Maybe set to true for follow-up, but since I'm calling next function, optional\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"send_message\">\n\n<param name=\"message\" type=\"string\">Happy Birthday!</param>\n\n<param name=\"recipient\" type=\"string\">Shishir</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nFor `recall_memory_search`, request_heartbeat defaults to False, but I can set it if I want.\n\nSince I'm calling another function right after, it might not be necessary.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll just call both without extra heartbeats."}

Perhaps I need to represent it as a string, like \"x**2\" or something, but the function expects a callable.\n\n  - Looking back: \"function (any): The mathematical function... provided as a callable object.\" But in my response format, I can't pass a Python callable; I have to use the specified format.\n\n  - This might be an issue. The system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But I'm supposed to only return function calls or point it out in the response format.\n\n  - The instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\n  - For estimate_derivative, I need to provide a \"function\" parameter, which is a callable. But in my tool call, I have to specify it as one of the types, say a string representing the function.\n\n  - Perhaps I can pass it as a string, like \"lambda x: x**2\", and assume the system can handle it. But the function description says \"provided as a callable object\", not as a string.\n\n  - This could be a limitation. I need to check if I can proceed.\n\n  - The user specified f(x) = x^2, so I might need to call it with that.\n\n  - In the tool call format, for the parameter, I have to say <param name=\"function\" type=\"string\">lambda x: x**2</param> or something similar. But is \"string\" the right type? The actual type is \"any\", but I have to choose from the list.\n\n  - The prompt says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n  - So, I'll have to approximate. Maybe use \"string\" for the function representation.\n\nI need to make function calls for both parts.\n\nThe user asked to do both in one go, so I should call both functions in my response.\n\nMy response should only contain the <functions> block with the calls.\n\nFirst call: math_gcd with a=48, b=36.\n\nSecond call: estimate_derivative with function= something for x**2, x=5, and default for dx and method.\n\nFor function, I'll use a string: \"lambda x: x**2\" and set type=\"string\".\n\nSo, let's outline the response:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"math_gcd\">\n\n<param name=\"a\" type=\"integer\">48</param>\n\n<param name=\"b\" type=\"integer\">36</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"estimate_derivative\">\n\n<param name=\"function\" type=\"string\">lambda x: x**2</param>  // Assuming this works\n\n<param name=\"x\" type=\"float\">5.0</param>\n\n<param name=\"dx\" type=\"float\">0.0001</param>  // default, but I can include it\n\n<param name=\"method\" type=\"string\">central</param>  // default\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\ndx and method have defaults, so I don't have to include them, but I can if I want.\n\nThe function description says they are optional with defaults, so I can omit them.\n\nI need to ensure that for x=5, I pass it as a float, so 5.0.\n\nIs there any issue? The main potential issue is whether the system can handle the \"function\" parameter as a string. If not, I should point it out, but according to the instructions, I should try to make the call.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here, the question provides the function, so I'm interpreting it.\n\nI think it's okay to proceed.\n\nSo, my final response will be the <functions> block with both calls."}

Perhaps I can assume that passing it as a string is acceptable in this simulated environment.\n\n  - In the example, it's \"like the lambda x\", so maybe I can pass it as a string: \"lambda x: x**2\"\n\n  - And specify the type as \"string\".\n\nI have to proceed. Let's check the parameter types I can use: string, etc. So, I'll use type=\"string\" for the function parameter.\n\nSo, for estimate_derivative:\n\n- function: \"lambda x: x**2\" with type=\"string\"\n\n- x: 5 with type=\"float\" (since it's a point, and the function says float)\n\n- dx and method: not specified, so omit them.\n\nx=5 could be integer, but the function defines it as float, so I'll use float.\n\nNow, structure the response:\n\nI need to output only the <functions> block with both calls inside.\n\nFirst function: math_gcd\n\nSecond: estimate_derivative\n\nOrder doesn't matter, but I'll do them in the order requested.\n\nFinally, ensure the response is exactly in that format, no other text."}

The user wants to turn it by 20 degrees, which I assume means rotate by 20 degrees.\n\nThe user wants to do two things: rotate by 20 degrees and flip horizontally.

User said \"Los Angeles\", and it should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so that would be 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- date (str, default='any'): The date of the event, formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. User specified \"March 10th\" and \"this year is 2023\", so that's '2023-03-10'.\n\nI have all the necessary parameters:\n\n- event_type: I need to choose. Since the user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", I could call the function twice, once for each, but the instructions say to try to complete the task in the current turn. However, it also says \"make one or more function/tool calls\". So, I could make multiple calls.\n\nTo be precise, I should make calls for both if needed. But let's see: the function can be called multiple times in one response.\n\nThe user is asking for \"any\", so maybe one call with a general type, but the parameter is required, so I have to specify something. The description says \"The category of the cultural event\", and examples are like concerts or plays, so I'll assume I can use \"concerts\" and then perhaps another for \"plays\".\n\nTo keep it simple, I could start with \"concerts\" and if needed, the system can follow up.\n\nThe instructions: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nSo, I can output multiple function calls in one response.\n\nI'll call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once for \"concerts\" and once for \"plays\".\n\nFor city: 'Los Angeles, CA'\n\nFor date: '2023-03-10'\n\nNow, format the response: I need to use the exact format specified.\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">concerts</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">Los Angeles, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-03-10</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"Events_3_FindEvents\">\n\n<param name=\"event_type\" type=\"string\">plays</param>\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">Los Angeles, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"date\" type=\"string\">2023-03-10</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThat seems correct. The type for each param must be specified, and I've used \"string\" for all, which is appropriate.\n\nIs there anything missing? The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", so \"concerts\" might cover music concerts, and \"plays\" for theater plays.\n\nI think that's fine."}

The city should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so 'Sunnyvale, CA'. The user didn't specify if it should be unisex, so I can use the default 'dontcare'.\n\nFor the second part: Book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nThis matches Services_1_BookAppointment. I have:\n\n- stylist_name: 'Elegant Styles'\n\n- appointment_time: '15:00' (which is in 24-hour format)\n\n- appointment_date: '2023-05-10'\n\nAll parameters are provided, so I can call this function directly.\n\nI need to make function calls in the specified format.

I don't need to add any other text.\n\nSo, my response should only contain the function calls.\n\nLet me outline the calls:\n\n1. For Services_1_FindProvider:\n\n- name: \"Services_1_FindProvider\"\n\n- params:\n\n  - city: \"Sunnyvale, CA\" (type: string)\n\n  - is_unisex: 'dontcare' (type: boolean, but it's a string 'dontcare' as per the function description)\n\nThe function description says: is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\n\nIn the args, it's specified as bool, but default is 'dontcare'. I need to check: it says bool, with default 'dontcare'. In the description: \"True for unisex, False for gender-specific, or dontcare for no preference.\"\n\nSo, for the type in my function call, it should be \"boolean\", but 'dontcare' is a string. The instructions say: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nIn the function definition, it's defined as bool, but the default is 'dontcare', which might be a string. However, to match the function's arg type, I should use \"boolean\". But 'dontcare' isn't a boolean; it's a special value.\n\nLooking back: \"is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\"\n\nIn the description: \"Flag indicating if the salon is unisex. True for unisex, False for gender-specific, or dontcare for no preference.\"\n\nThis is inconsistent. In code, it's probably handled as a string or something, but the arg is typed as bool.\n\nFor my purpose, when I call it, I need to specify the type as per the function's definition, which is \"bool\". But 'dontcare' isn't a bool.\n\nPerhaps I should treat it as a string because 'dontcare' is a string.\n\nThe instructions say: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: ...\"\n\nIn the function list, it's specified as bool, so I'll use \"boolean\" for is_unisex.\n\nBut what value to put? If I put 'dontcare', and type as boolean, that might be wrong.\n\nPerhaps the function expects a string: \"True\", \"False\", or \"dontcare\".\n\nTo be safe, I'll check the function description again: \"is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\"\n\nThis is ambiguous, but in the args description, it says: \"True for unisex, False for gender-specific, or dontcare for no preference.\"\n\nI think for the function call, I should pass it as a string, and specify the type as \"string\", because 'dontcare' is not a boolean value.\n\nThe function is defined with Args: is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare'), which might mean in code it's a bool with a default string, but that's odd.\n\nPerhaps in the context, 'dontcare' is accepted as a string.\n\nTo match the instructions, I need to choose the correct type. The available types include \"string\" and \"boolean\".\n\nI think the safest is to use \"string\" for is_unisex when it's 'dontcare'.\n\nUpon second thought, in the function description, it's listed as (bool, default='dontcare'), but in the docstring, it's explained as accepting 'dontcare'.\n\nFor my response, I'll use type=\"string\" for is_unisex with value \"dontcare\".\n\nNow, for the second function: Services_1_BookAppointment\n\n- stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\" (type: string)\n\n- appointment_time: \"15:00\" (type: string)\n\n- appointment_date: \"2023-05-10\" (type: string)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"Services_1_FindProvider\">\n\n<param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">Sunnyvale, CA</param>\n\n<param name=\"is_unisex\" type=\"string\">dontcare</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"Services_1_BookAppointment\">\n\n<param name=\"stylist_name\" type=\"string\">Elegant Styles</param>\n\n<param name=\"appointment_time\" type=\"string\">15:00</param>\n\n<param name=\"appointment_date\" type=\"string\">2023-05-10</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nI think that's all for this turn."}
