The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user mentioned a Caesar salad, so foodItem is \"Caesar salad\". They want it without anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\".

The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink ID is 123. The new preferences are large size, hot, regular sweetness, and almond milk. The new_preferences should be a dictionary with keys like size, temperature, sweetness, and milk.

The user wants me to clone a repository, analyze its contents, create or update a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on that analysis, add the changes to Git, and then commit and push them.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repo. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll leave it as default. So the first function call is clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\nNext, after cloning, I have to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory by default, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (the repo name). So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name set to 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce the analysis is done, I need to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Assuming the analysis determines the correct directory, I'll use the same 'nodejs-welcome' directory. But wait, maybe the analysis result would tell me if the Dockerfile already exists. However, the user's instruction says to create/update based on analysis. Since the function only creates a Dockerfile, maybe it's intended to create it regardless. So I'll proceed with create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name. The user didn't specify deployment name, image name, replicas, etc., so I'll use the defaults. The directory name is 'nodejs-welcome', so I'll call that function with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and leave other parameters as default.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can handle adding changes if the 'commit_message' is provided. Wait, the function's description says it automatically git add all changes. So I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', and maybe a commit message. The user didn't specify a commit message, so I can use a default like \"Updated Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\". Also, branch name might be needed, but if not provided, it'll use the current branch. So the parameters would be directory_name, commit_message, and possibly branch_name if required. Since the user didn't specify, I'll omit branch_name and force_push unless needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the functions should be called in order: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github. Each subsequent function depends on the previous one's success. The parameters are filled based on the given info and defaults where necessary."}

The first is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The second is to get the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure proper overriding.\n\nStarting with the first request: finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', which would be 'CellResult', and 'include_subdirectories' set to true since the user wants to include subdirectories. The 'case_sensitive' parameter isn't specified, so I'll default it to false, which is the standard behavior unless stated otherwise.\n\nNext, for the method signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler', the 'get_signature' function is the right choice. Each method requires a separate function call. The parameters for each would be 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as the respective method. The 'include_private' parameter isn't mentioned, so it can be omitted or set to false.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided.

The 'get_class_info' might not be needed since the user isn't asking about class structure but method signatures.

The function get_area_of_square takes a size parameter, which is a float. The user provided 5 cm, so the size is 5. The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention units, just the numerical value. So I should call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. Queenstown is a town in Singapore, so the location should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit parameter is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it out or set it to a default like 'metric' if needed. But since the function allows it to be optional, I can just provide the location.\n\nWait, does Singapore use Celsius or Fahrenheit? The function's unit parameter might accept 'C' or 'F', but since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better not to assume.
