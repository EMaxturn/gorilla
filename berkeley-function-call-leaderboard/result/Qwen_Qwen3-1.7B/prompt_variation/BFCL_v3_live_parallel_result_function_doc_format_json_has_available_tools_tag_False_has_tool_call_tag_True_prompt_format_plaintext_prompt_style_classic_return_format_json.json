Boston is in MA, so \"Boston, MA\". The unit is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit. Since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default.\n\nThen, San Francisco. The location would be \"San Francisco, CA\". Again, default unit unless specified. The user didn't mention a unit, so stick with the default.\n\nI need to make two separate function calls, one for each city. The parameters for each will have the location and the default unit. No other parameters are needed. So the tool calls should list both functions with their respective locations."}

The second is for the Marriott in Los Angeles with 1 adult and 2 children from June 1 to June 10, 2022.\n\nLooking at the available function, there's hotel_booking_book. The parameters required are hotel_name, location, check_in, check_out, adults, and children. Both reservations need to be processed with this function.\n\nFor the first reservation: hotel_name is Sheraton, location is New York, check_in is May 1, 2022, check_out is May 5, 2022. Adults are 2, children 1. That's all the parameters needed.\n\nSecond reservation: hotel_name is Marriott, location Los Angeles, check_in June 1, 2022, check_out June 10, 2022. Adults 1, children 2. All parameters are present here as well.\n\nI need to make two separate calls to the hotel_booking_book function with the respective parameters. The user didn't mention any other details, so I assume the function handles the rest. No missing parameters here. Both reservations are valid and fit the function's requirements. So, I'll generate the two tool calls."}

The user wants to log their food intake. They mentioned two separate meals: one with frozen mango pieces and another with pepperoni pizza slices. Also, they had coffee.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's the log_food function. It requires food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type, and optionally log_date. The parameters are food_name, portion_amount (float), portion_unit (from the enum), meal_type (enum with breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, default snack), and log_date (default None).\n\nFor the first part: 8 pieces of frozen mango. The portion_unit should be 'piece' since they're using 'pieces'. The meal_type is 'snack' by default, but maybe the user wants to specify if it's a snack or a different meal. But the user didn't mention a specific meal type for mango, so maybe snack is okay. The portion_amount is 8.0. So log_food with food_name 'frozen mango', portion_amount 8.0, portion_unit 'piece', meal_type 'snack'.\n\nThen, two slices of pepperoni pizza. Portion_unit is 'slice', portion_amount 2.0, meal_type 'snack' again. So log_food with food_name 'pepperoni pizza', portion_amount 2.0, portion_unit 'slice', meal_type 'snack'.\n\nThe coffee part: the user said \"a coffee\". But the function's food_name is for food items, not drinks. So maybe coffee isn't a food item. The user might have meant they had coffee, but since the function is for food, maybe they didn't log it. But the user said \"I had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea. Earlier I had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee\". So the coffee is a drink. Since the function only logs food, maybe we can't log it. But the user might want to log it, but the function doesn't support drinks. So perhaps we should not log coffee here. But the user might have intended to log it, but since the function is for food, we can't. So maybe we don't include coffee in the log_food calls.\n\nSo the two function calls would be for the mango and pepperoni pizza. The coffee isn't logged because it's not a food item."}
