If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But then it says to only return function calls in that section.\n\nThis is conflicting. The prompt clarifies: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" So, if I need to point something out, I might not return anything, but that doesn't make sense. Actually, it says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nPerhaps if I can't invoke, I just don't output anything, but that contradicts \"point it out.\" The prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI should only output <TOOLCALL> if I'm calling a function.
