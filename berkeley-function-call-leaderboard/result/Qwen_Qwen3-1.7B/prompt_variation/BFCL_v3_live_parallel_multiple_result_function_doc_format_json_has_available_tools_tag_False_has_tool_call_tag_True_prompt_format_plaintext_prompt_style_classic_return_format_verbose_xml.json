The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the user is replacing the food item from whatever it was before with a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The original food item isn't specified, but the user is changing it to Caesar salad. So I'll set foodItem to \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients to \"anchovies\", and maybe set specialInstructions if needed. Since they didn't mention any other changes, maybe just removeIngredients is enough.\n\nThen for the drink, the user wants drink_id 123, size large, temperature hot, sweetness_level regular, milk_type almond. The ChaDri.change_drink function has parameters drink_id, new_preferences which includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The default for size is medium, so I need to set it to large. Temperature is hot, sweetness regular, milk almond. The default for milk_type is regular, so I need to change that to almond. The user didn't mention any special instructions, so that's empty.\n\nSo I need to call ChaFod with the food item and remove ingredients, and ChaDri.change_drink with the drink ID and the updated preferences. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. For the food, newIngredients is optional, but the user wants to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". The specialInstructions might not be needed here. For the drink, the new_preferences should have all the specified parameters."}

The function needs a 'location' parameter, which should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. The user provided both cities, so I need to call the function twice, once for each city.\n\nFor Guangzhou, the location would be 'Guangzhou, China' or 'Guangzhou, CN'. The unit is specified as metric, which is the default, so that's already set. Similarly, Beijing's location is 'Beijing, China' or 'Beijing, CN'. \n\nWait, the parameters require the location to be a string. So I'll format each city accordingly. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so the default unit is metric, which is correct. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls, one for each city. The function name is get_current_weather, and each call will have the respective location. The parameters are location and unit, but unit is optional with a default of metric.

The parameters required are location, category, and language. The user specified Paris, France, so the location is \"Paris, France\". The category for the first request is general news, but the user mentioned \"in English\" which is the default, so maybe the category can be left as default. Wait, the default for category is 'General', but the user didn't specify a category for the first request. Wait, the user said \"latest news report for Paris, France, in English\" \u2013 they might want general news, but the category is not specified. However, the user also asked for technology news in the second part.

The first is Paris, France, in English, and the second is Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news in English. So I need to call get_news_report twice. \n\nFirst call: location is \"Paris, France\", category is 'General' (since the user didn't specify a category for the first part), language is 'en'. Second call: location is \"Letterkenny, Ireland\", category is 'Technology', language is 'en'. \n\nI need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The location for the first call is \"Paris, France\" which is in the required format. The category for the first call is 'General' as the default, but the user didn't specify a category, so it's okay.

The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions are needed.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and optionally destination. Since the default destination is the current directory, I can just pass the repo_url. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The repo directory is probably the one where the cloned repo is, so I'll use the same directory name as the cloned repo. But wait, the cloned repo's directory might be named something else. However, the user didn't specify, so I'll assume the directory name is the same as the repo URL. Wait, the repo URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, but the directory name for the Dockerfile would be the directory where the repo was cloned. Since the default destination for clone_repo is '.', I'll use that as the directory_name for create_a_docker_file.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name. Again, assuming the same directory as the cloned repo, which is '.' by default. So I'll call this function with directory_name as '.'.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name and optionally commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory_name here would be the cloned repo's directory, which is '.'. The commit message defaults to 'Update changes', which is okay. The branch name is 'main' by default. Force push is false by default. So I'll call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as '.'.\n\nWait, but the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function, which automatically adds all changes. So that's covered.\n\nNow, checking if all parameters are present. For clone_repo, repo_url is provided. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is the cloned directory. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, same directory. For push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is the cloned directory. All parameters are there.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name=\".\"\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name=\".\"\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name=\".\"\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The clone_repo's destination is default '.', which is correct. The other functions' parameters are set as per the required ones."}

The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so I need to find classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters required are 'search_string' and 'include_subdirectories'. The search string should be 'CellResult' and include subdirectories as true.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters needed are 'class_name' and 'method_name'. For 'setCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method is 'setCellValue'. Similarly, for 'getCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method is 'getCellValue'. The 'include_private' parameter is set to false by default, so it's okay.\n\nI need to make sure that the functions are called correctly. The first function call is to 'get_relevant_classes' with the search string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true. Then, two separate calls to 'get_signature' for each method.
