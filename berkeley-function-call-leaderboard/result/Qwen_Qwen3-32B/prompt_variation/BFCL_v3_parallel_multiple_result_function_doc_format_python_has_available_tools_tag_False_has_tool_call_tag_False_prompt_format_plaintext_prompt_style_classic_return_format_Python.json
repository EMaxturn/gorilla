John has three investment options, and I need to calculate the returns for each using the given functions. Let me break down each option one by one.\n\nFirst option: simple interest. The parameters are $5000 principal, 5 years, 4% annual rate. The function provided is calc_Simple_Interest. The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate. So I can plug those values in directly. The formula for simple interest is principal * rate * time, so that should give the interest, and then add to principal for total amount. But the function might return the total future value or just the interest. Wait, the function's description says \"compute simple interest,\" which usually refers to just the interest earned. But sometimes people might use it to mean the total amount. Hmm. Let me check the function's name again. The future_value function is for future value, so maybe calc_Simple_Interest returns just the interest. But the user might expect the total amount. Wait, the problem says \"calculate the returns,\" which would be the total amount. So maybe I need to add the principal and the interest. But the functions provided might already handle that. Let me check the function definitions again.\n\nLooking at the functions: calc_Simple_Interest's docstring says \"Compute simple interest,\" which is likely the interest amount. Similarly, calc_Compound_Interest probably returns the interest, and future_value returns the total amount. Wait, the future_value function's description says \"calculates the future value,\" which is the total amount. So for the first option, using calc_Simple_Interest would give the interest, and then John would add that to the principal to get the total. But the user might want the total. However, the problem says to use the respective functions. The first option says to use calc_Simple_Interest. So maybe that function returns the total amount. Wait, no, simple interest formula is A = P(1 + rt), which is principal plus interest. But sometimes the function might just return the interest. Let me think. The function's name is calc_Simple_Interest. Typically, \"simple interest\" refers to the interest earned, not the total amount. So perhaps the function returns the interest. But the user's question says \"calculate the returns,\" which would be the total. Hmm. Maybe the functions are designed to return the total. Let me check the parameters. The future_value function's parameters include initial_investment, interest_rate (as decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The formula for future value with compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). For simple interest, it's A = P(1 + rt). So if the calc_Simple_Interest function is supposed to compute the total amount, then the function would return that. But the problem says to use the given functions. The user's instruction is to use calc_Simple_Interest for the first option, calc_Compound_Interest for the second, and future_value for the third. So I need to use those functions as per their parameters.\n\nSo for the first option: calc_Simple_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4. The annual rate is in percentage, so 4% is 0.04 as a decimal. Wait, the function's parameters for annual_rate say \"interest rate in percentage,\" so if the user inputs 4, it's 4%, so the function would handle it as 4/100. So the function would compute 5000 * 5 * 4% = 5000 * 0.04 *5 = 1000. Then total amount would be 5000 + 1000 = 6000. But if the function returns the total, then it's 6000. But if it returns just the interest, then the interest is 1000. The problem says \"calculate the returns,\" which is the total amount. So maybe the function returns the total. Let me check the function's code if possible. Since I can't see the code, I have to rely on the description. The description says \"compute simple interest,\" which is ambiguous. However, given that there's a future_value function that's supposed to be used for the third option, which is compound interest with specific parameters, perhaps the calc_Simple_Interest and calc_Compound_Interest functions return the total amount. Alternatively, maybe they return the interest, and the user needs to add the principal. But the user's question says to use the functions as given. Let's proceed as per the functions' parameters.\n\nSo for the first option, the parameters are principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4. So call calc_Simple_Interest with those values.\n\nSecond option: compound interest, annual rate 3.5%, compounds annually. The function to use is calc_Compound_Interest. Parameters: principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1 (since it's annually). The function's default for compound_freq is 1, so maybe we can omit it. But to be explicit, include it.\n\nThird option: initial amount $3000, annual rate 5%, 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function to use is future_value. Parameters: initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05 (since it's a decimal), time=6, num_compoundings=2. Wait, the interest rate in the function is a decimal, so 5% is 0.05. The annual rate given here is 5%, so convert to 0.05. The time is 6 years, and num_compoundings is 2 (twice a year). So the parameters are correct.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4)\n2. calc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1)\n3. future_value(initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2)\n\nI need to make sure that all parameters are correctly passed. For the annual_rate in the first two functions, it's in percentage, so 4 and 3.5. For the future_value function, the interest_rate is a decimal, so 5% becomes 0.05. Also, the third option's initial investment is $3000, not $5000, as per the problem statement. Yes, the third option is a separate investment of $3000. So that's correct."}
