I have to work with what's available, so I'll use \"sculpture\" as the art_form.\n\nThis seems to cover the request.\n\nI need to format my response as a <TOOLCALL> with the function call.\n\nThe exact format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, it would be: <TOOLCALL>[find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should use \"New York, NY\" as per the example in the function description.\n\nSince month defaults to upcoming, and user_ratings to 'high', I don't need to specify them unless I want to override.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So, this one call should suffice.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY be the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else."}
{"id": "multiple_191", "result": "<TOOLCALL>[book_hotel(hotel_name=\"Hotel Paradise\", location=\"Las Vegas\", room_type=\"luxury room\", start_date=\"05-12-2022\", stay_duration=3, view=\"city view\")]</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 586, "output_token_count": 51, "latency": 7.280841588973999, "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants to book a hotel room. Looking at the available functions, there's one called \"book_hotel\" that seems perfect for this.\n\nLet me recall the args for book_hotel:\n\n- hotel_name (str): The name of the hotel.\n\n- location (str): The location of the hotel.\n\n- room_type (str): The type of room preferred.\n\n- start_date (str): The starting date of the stay in format MM-DD-YYYY.\n\n- stay_duration (int): The duration of the stay in days.\n\n- view (str, default='No preference'): The preferred view from the room.\n\nFrom the user's query:\n\n- Hotel name: Hotel Paradise\n\n- Location: Las Vegas\n\n- Room type: Luxury room (I need to map this to something like \"luxury\")\n\n- Start date: May 12, 2022, which should be in MM-DD-YYYY format, so that's 05-12-2022\n\n- Stay duration: 3 days\n\n- View: City view\n\nThe user specified \"luxury room\", so I'll use that as the room_type.\n\nAll the required parameters are present:\n\n- hotel_name: \"Hotel Paradise\"\n\n- location: \"Las Vegas\"\n\n- room_type: \"luxury room\" or perhaps just \"luxury\"? The function says \"The type of room preferred\", so \"luxury room\" should be fine.\n\n- start_date: \"05-12-2022\" (need to format it as MM-DD-YYYY)\n\n- stay_duration: 3\n\n- view: \"city view\"\n\nView has a default, but since it's specified, I should include it.\n\nI need to format my response as a TOOLCALL. The exact format is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this, it's just one function: book_hotel.\n\nLet me construct it:\n\nbook_hotel(\n\n    hotel_name=\"Hotel Paradise\",\n\n    location=\"Las Vegas\",\n\n    room_type=\"luxury room\",\n\n    start_date=\"05-12-2022\",\n\n    stay_duration=3,\n\n    view=\"city view\"\n\n)\n\nThe date is \"May 12, 2022\", which is May 12th, so MM-DD-YYYY is 05-12-2022. That seems correct.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not adding any other text; just the TOOLCALL section.\n\nThis seems to cover the user's request fully, so I don't need to chain more functions.\n\nFinally, output only the TOOLCALL."}
