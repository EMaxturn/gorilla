The user is asking for the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nThe question is about displacement, so I should check the available functions. There's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The parameters given are 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. All the required parameters are present. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2, so I can include that or leave it out. Let me make sure the function is the right one. The formula for displacement when there's constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. The function should handle that. So the correct call would be using calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. Rounding can be omitted since it's optional. So the answer should be the function call with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe relevant function here is video_games.store_price. It requires game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I need to call store_price with these parameters. I don't need to check if it's on sale because the question is about the selling price, which might already account for any sales. But wait, maybe the on_sale function could affect the price. However, the user specifically asked for the selling price, so the store_price function should return the current price, considering any sales. Therefore, I should directly use store_price with the given parameters."}

The available functions are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The question is about finding the final speed, so maybe calculate_speed_from_rest is the right one here. Let me check the parameters for that function. It requires distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). The user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial speed is 0 since it started from rest. That fits perfectly. The function should calculate the final speed using those parameters. I don't need to use calculate_acceleration because the question isn't asking for acceleration, just the final speed. So the correct call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is already 0 by default, so no need to specify it unless required, but the function's required parameters are distance and time, which are provided. Yep, that's the one."}

Since the question is about mixing gases and finding the final temperature, the calculate_final_temperature function seems appropriate.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for calculate_final_temperature: quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. The user provided all these values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. All required parameters are present. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_mass here because the problem doesn't involve mass or molar mass. The quantities given are in moles, and the function for final temperature uses quantities and temperatures directly. \n\nSo the correct function call should be calculate_final_temperature with the provided parameters. No missing parameters, so the function can be called as is."}

The parameters required are 'elements' and 'order', with 'asc' as the default. Since the user specified ascending, I can use the default. The elements are the list of names provided. So I should call sort_list with elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order='asc'. But since order is default, maybe I can omit it. Wait, the parameters require 'elements' as mandatory, and 'order' is optional. So the function call would be sort_list(elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], order='asc'). Alternatively, just sort_list(elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack']) because the order defaults to 'asc'. The user explicitly said ascending, so including it might be better for clarity. Either way, the function should work. I think that's the correct tool to use here. The other functions like filter_list and sum_elements don't apply here. So the answer is to call sort_list with the elements and order."}

That's 6 combinations. So the probability would be 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6. \n\nBut wait, the user provided a function called dice_roll_probability. Let me check the parameters. The function requires desired_sum, and sides_per_die. The default for n_rolls is 1, but here we have two dice. Oh, wait, the n_rolls parameter is the number of dice rolled. So in this case, n_rolls should be 2. The desired_sum is 7, and sides_per_die is 6 since standard dice have 6 sides.\n\nSo the function call should include desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Let me make sure all required parameters are there. The required ones are desired_sum and sides_per_die, which are both provided. n_rolls is optional but needs to be set to 2 here.
