Gravity is optional with a default of 9.81. So I just need to pass the height. Let me check the function's parameters again. The height is required, initial_velocity is optional with a default, and gravity is optional. So the correct call would be to use the height of 150. Since initial_velocity is zero, maybe the function will use that default. So the tool call should be calculate_final_velocity with height=150. I don't need to include initial_velocity or gravity since they have defaults. Wait, but the user specified initial velocity is zero, so maybe it's better to explicitly set it to zero?

The parameters need to be in an array. Each condition should be a dictionary with 'field' and 'value' keys. For the age condition, the field is 'age' and the value is 25, with the operator '>'. For the job, the field is 'job' and the value is 'engineer', with the operator '='. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters for conditions are an array of conditions. Each condition is a dictionary. So I need to structure each condition as a separate object in the array. So the conditions array would have two elements: one for age and one for job.

Since they want this to happen twice in a row, I need to multiply the probability of getting a six on the first roll by the probability of getting a six on the second roll.

I need to use the lawsuit_search function.\n\nFirst, check the required parameters: company, start_date, location. All are required. The status is optional, defaulting to 'ongoing'. The user specified 'ongoing', so maybe I don't need to include it, but including it explicitly might be better to ensure it's clear.\n\nCompany is 'Google', start_date should be January 1, 2021, which is 01-01-2021. Location is California. So the parameters are all there. Let me make sure the date format is correct. The function expects MM-DD-YYY, so 01-01-2021 is right. Location is the full state name, so 'California' is correct. Status is ongoing, which is the default, but including it might be redundant. However, since the user mentioned 'ongoing', maybe include it to be explicit. Wait, the function's status parameter is optional, so if not provided, it defaults to ongoing. Since the user says 'ongoing', maybe it's better to include it. But the default is already ongoing, so maybe it's not necessary. But the user's query says 'ongoing', so including it would make it clear. However, the function's parameters say that status is optional with default 'ongoing'. So maybe it's safe to omit it. But the user explicitly says 'ongoing', so perhaps include it. Hmm. Let me check the function's description again. The status parameter's description says the default is 'ongoing'. So if the user wants ongoing, we can omit it. But the user's query says 'ongoing', so maybe include it. Wait, the function's parameters have status as optional, so if the user specifies it, we include it. But in this case, the user says 'ongoing', so maybe include it. But since the default is already ongoing, maybe it's redundant. However, to be precise, perhaps include it. But the function's parameters don't require it. So the correct approach is to include the required parameters: company, start_date, location. The status is optional, and since the user says 'ongoing', which is the default, maybe it's not needed. But to be safe, maybe include it. Wait, the user's query says 'ongoing lawsuits', so the status is ongoing. So the function call should include status='ongoing' even though it's the default. But the function's parameters say that if not provided, it defaults to ongoing. So including it is optional. However, the user's query explicitly mentions 'ongoing', so including it would make the call more precise. But the function's parameters don't require it. So perhaps it's better to include it. Alternatively, maybe the user's query is just specifying the status, so including it is better. But the function's parameters have status as optional. So the correct function call would have company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', and status='ongoing'. But wait, the start_date is for when the lawsuit was filed. The user says 'filed after January 1, 2021'. Wait, the start_date parameter is the start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the end date is not specified. But the function's parameters only have start_date. Wait, the function's parameters only have start_date and location, and status. So the function is designed to take a start date and end date? Wait, no, looking back at the function definition: the parameters are start_date (required) and location (required). The function's description says \"date range for when the lawsuit was filed in the format of MM-DD-YYY\". Wait, but the function only has a start_date parameter. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take a start_date and end_date, but in the given function definition, only start_date is present. Wait, looking back at the function's XML:\n\n<function name=\"lawsuit_search\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"company\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n    ...\n    <param name=\"start_date\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n      <desc>Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed in the format of MM-DD-YYY.</desc>\n    </param>\n    <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n    ...\n  </params>\n</function>\n\nWait, the function only has start_date as a parameter. But the description says \"date range\", which implies both start and end. But the function only has start_date. That's a problem. But maybe the function is designed to take start_date as the beginning of the range, and the end date is not specified, or perhaps it's a mistake. But according to the given function, only start_date is present. So the user's query says \"filed after January 1, 2021\". So the start_date would be January 1, 2021, but the function's start_date is the start of the date range. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after that date, perhaps the start_date is set to January 1, 2021, and the function would return lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user says \"after\", which would be strictly after. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date. So maybe the function is designed to take a start_date and the end_date is not required, but the user's query is to search for lawsuits filed after a certain date. But the function's parameters only have start_date. So perhaps the function is designed to take a start_date, and the end_date is not part of the parameters. Therefore, the user's query is to search for lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021. So the start_date would be January 1, 2021, and the function would return lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user says \"after\", which is strictly after. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so maybe the function is designed to take a start_date and the end_date is not required. Therefore, the correct approach is to set start_date to January 1, 2021, and the function would return lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user's query says \"after\", which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, we can only provide the start_date. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\ncompany: Google\nstart_date: 01-01-2021\nlocation: California\nstatus: ongoing (optional, but user specified it)\n\nBut the function's start_date is the start of the date range. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, perhaps the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the function would return lawsuits filed on or after that date. However, the user's query says \"after\", which is strictly after. But without an end_date parameter, the function can't handle that. Therefore, the best we can do is set the start_date to January 1, 2021, and the function would return lawsuits filed on or after that date. The user might need to adjust the start_date if they want strictly after, but given the function's parameters, that's the best we can do.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nlawsuit_search(company=\"Google\", start_date=\"01-01-2021\", location=\"California\", status=\"ongoing\")\n\nBut wait, the status is optional, and the default is ongoing. So including it is redundant, but since the user specified 'ongoing', it's better to include it. However, the function's parameters don't require it. So the function call would have the required parameters and the status. Therefore, the correct function call is as above."}

The date is next month. Wait, the date parameter needs to be a specific string. The user said \"next month,\" so I need to convert that into a date format. Let's assume today's date is October 2023, so next month would be November. The date parameter might expect a start and end date, but the function's description says \"Time frame to get the concert for.\" Hmm, the function's date parameter is a string, but the example might need a specific format. Maybe the user expects a single date, but the function might require a range. However, the function's parameters only have a single date field. Wait, looking back, the function's date parameter is a string and required. The user said \"next month,\" so perhaps the date should be set to the start of next month, like \"2023-11-01\" or \"November 2023\". Since the exact format isn't specified, I'll use \"next month\" as the value, but maybe the function expects a specific date. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle relative dates. But the function's parameters don't specify a format, so I'll use \"next month\" as the date parameter. Wait, but the function's date parameter is described as \"Time frame to get the concert for.\" Maybe it's a date range, but the parameter is a single string. Maybe the user's input is acceptable as \"next month\". Alternatively, perhaps the function expects a specific date, so I need to calculate it. But since the current date isn't provided, I can't compute it. The user might have intended to use \"next month\" as the date. So I'll proceed with that. Therefore, the parameters would be location: \"New York\", date: \"next month\", genre: \"pop\". Let me check if all required parameters are present. Yes, location, date, genre are all required.

Wait, the user wrote \"March 10th, 2023\", so maybe the function expects a string in that format. But the function's parameter is a string, so it's acceptable. However, sometimes systems require specific date formats. But since the function's parameter doesn't specify, I'll use the user's input as given. Alternatively, maybe the system can parse it. But to be safe, I'll use the ISO format. Wait, the user's input is \"March 10th, 2023\", so I should probably convert that to \"2023-03-10\" to match standard date formats. But the function's parameter is a string, so maybe it's okay. However, the user might have intended that. Let me check the function's parameter description again. The start_date is a string, and the description says \"The date when your stay begins.\" So the exact format isn't specified, but it's better to use a standard format like YYYY-MM-DD.
