The only function is 'change_food'. Let me check its description:\n\n- Name: change_food\n\n- Description: Modifies the food item based on the customer's request, such as changing ingredients or preparation methods.\n\n- Parameters:\n\n  - food_item: The name of the food item to be modified. (string)\n\n  - modification_request: Specific request detailing the changes. (string) It says if there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma.\n\nThis seems perfect for the user's request. They want to modify a burger.\n\nRequired parameters:\n\n- food_item: I can use \"burger\" from the user's message.\n\n- modification_request: The user said: \"no onions, extra cheese\". According to the function, if there are multiple requests, separate them with a comma and no space. The user already has them as \"no onions, extra cheese\", but let's check the exact wording.\n\nThe user said: \"no onions, extra cheese\". That has a space after the comma, but the function specifies: \"separate using comma with no space between comma\". The function description says: \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". I think it means no space after the comma, like \"no onions,extra cheese\".\n\nIn the user's message, it's \"no onions, extra cheese\" which has a space after the comma. I need to format it correctly for the function.\n\nThe function parameter description: \"Specific request detailing the changes to be made to the food item, such as 'no peanuts' or 'extra spicy'. If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma.\"\n\nSo, for multiple, it should be like \"no onions,extra cheese\" without space after comma.\n\nI need to provide it in the exact format required.\n\nIn my response, I have to call the function with the parameters.\n\nSo, for 'modification_request', I should format it as \"no onions,extra cheese\".\n\nThe user's verbatim is \"no onions, extra cheese\", but I need to adjust it to match the function's requirement.\n\nThe function says: \"separate using comma with no space between comma\". I interpret this as no space after the comma, so \"no onions,extra cheese\".\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting it together:\n\n- function: change_food\n\n- parameters:\n\n  - food_item: \"burger\"\n\n  - modification_request: \"no onions,extra cheese\"\n\nIs that accurate? The user said \"verbatim: no onions, extra cheese\", so I should use it as is, but the function requires no space, so I need to modify it for the function call.\n\nThe instruction is to make the function call correctly.\n\nThe user is ordering, but the function is just for modifying, not for actually placing an order. The description is \"Modifies the food item\", but the user said \"I would like to order a burger with modifications\". Is this function sufficient?\n\nThe available functions only have this one, so I have to use it if it fits.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But this seems to fit.\n\nIt might not handle the ordering part, but perhaps in this context, modifying implies preparing it for order.\n\nI should proceed with this function.\n\nMy response should only be the JSON array of function calls.\n\nSo, I need to output:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"change_food\",\"parameters\":{\"food_item\":\"burger\",\"modification_request\":\"no onions,extra cheese\"}}]\n```\n\nOne function call.\n\nAfter this, if needed, the system might handle the rest, but for now, this fulfills the request.\n\nThe user said \"order a burger\", but the function is just \"change_food\". Is that complete? The prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" And \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nWith this function, we're modifying the food, which is part of the order. I think that's as far as I can go with the available tools.\n\nNo other functions are provided, so this is it.\n\nAlright, let's format it correctly."}

The function has a default for movie_date as None, which means it would use the current date, but the prompt specifies to use today's date in India, so I should explicitly set it if needed.\n\nThe function description says: \"Default is the current date.\" But to be precise, my prompt says to default to today's date in India, so I'll assume the function handles it, but I can pass it explicitly.\n\nIn the parameters:\n\n- movie_date: {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date when the movies are playing, in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nBut earlier, it mentions: \"If your response contains function you have to put <<function>> infront of it.\"\n\nTo be safe, I should follow the primary instruction for function calls, which is to use the JSON format exactly.\n\nIn the example provided in the prompt: \"### Response: \" and then presumably the JSON.\n\nIn the text you gave: \"### Response: \" and it cuts off.\n\nTo match the format, I think I should just output the JSON as specified.\n\nHowever, to be precise, in the user's message, it's: \"<<function>>[[{\"name\": \"send_email\", ...}]]\"\n\nPerhaps for this setup, I need to output: <<function>> followed by the JSON array.\n\nBut the system prompt says: \"You MUST put it in the format of ```json [{\"function\":\"func_name1\",...}] ```\"\n\nI think the safe bet is to output exactly: ```json [the array] ```\n\nIn the initial description, it's wrapped in ```json ... ```, so probably that's the format.\n\nFinally, deciding: I'll output the JSON array as specified, without additional text, as per: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"send_email\",\"parameters\":{\"to_address\":\"andy@gorilla.ai\",\"subject\":\"Sales Forecast Request\",\"body\":\"where is the latest sales forecast spreadsheet?\"}}]\n```\n\nYes."}

It's an integer where, for example, 1 is cleaning, 2 is ironing, 3 is big cleaning.\n\nThe user mentioned \"housekeeper who provides ironing services.\" From the description, service_id 2 represents ironing service. So, I need to use service_id = 2.\n\n- province_id: For Chonburi, the description says 3 for Chonburi. So, province_id = 3.\n\n- district_name: Not specified in the user's query, so I can leave it as default (None).\n\n- sub_district_name: Not specified, so default (None).\n\n- rating: The user wants 4.5 stars or more, so I should set rating = 4.5.\n\n- start_available_date: The user specified availability on 12/03/2024 16:00 - 18:00. I need to format this as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. First, 12/03/2024 is likely MM/DD/YYYY, so December 3, 2024. But in ISO format, it's YYYY-MM-DD, so '2024-12-03 16:00:00' for the start.\n\nThe parameter description: start_available_date is the start of the availability period. The user wants providers available between 16:00 and 18:00 on that date. So, I should set start_available_date to '2024-12-03 16:00:00' and end_available_date to '2024-12-03 18:00:00'.\n\nThe function description: \"The start of the availability period\" and \"The end of the availability period\". This should filter providers available within that window.\n\nAll required parameters: Only service_id is required, and we're providing that.\n\nSo, I can make a function call with:\n\n- service_id: 2 (for ironing)\n\n- province_id: 3 (for Chonburi)\n\n- rating: 4.5\n\n- start_available_date: '2024-12-03 16:00:00'\n\n- end_available_date: '2024-12-03 18:00:00'\n\nThe date format in the user's message is '12/03/2024 16:00 - 18:00'. Assuming it's MM/DD/YYYY, as it's common in some regions, so 12/03/2024 is December 3, 2024. I'll go with that.\n\nMy response should only be the function call in the specified JSON format.\n\nFormat: ```json [ {\"function\": \"func_name\", \"parameters\": { ... }} ] ```\n\nSo, for this, it's a single function call.\n\nFinal parameters:\n\n{\n\n\"service_id\": 2,\n\n\"province_id\": 3,\n\n\"rating\": 4.5,\n\n\"start_available_date\": \"2024-12-03 16:00:00\",\n\n\"end_available_date\": \"2024-12-03 18:00:00\"\n\n}\n\nI think that's it.

From the available functions, we have 'getDataForProfessional', which retrieves a list of professional workers based on criteria like service type and location.\n\nMapping the user's request to the function parameters:\n\n- Service type: Ironing services. The function description says: 1 represents cleaning service, 2 represents ironing service, 3 represents big cleaning service. So, for ironing, service_id should be 2.\n\n- Location: Chiang Mai, Sankampang District, Ton Pao Subdistrict.\n\n  - Province: Chiang Mai. From the function, province_id: 1 for Bangkok, 2 for Chiang Mai, 3 for Chonburi. So, province_id = 2.\n\n  - District: Sankampang District. The parameter is 'district_name', which is a string for the name of the district.\n\n  - Sub-district: Ton Pao Subdistrict. The parameter is 'sub_district_name', which is a string.\n\n- Rating: 4.5 stars. The function has a 'rating' parameter, which is a float between 0.0 and 5.0.\n\n- Other parameters: The user didn't specify availability dates or late check-in, so I can use the defaults for those.\n\nThe function requires 'service_id' and 'province_id', which we have.

The description doesn't specify if it's minimum or exact, but typically it's a minimum.\n\nThe user said \"housewife\", but the function is for \"professional workers\". I'm not sure if that matches exactly, but based on the available tools, this is the closest. I should proceed with what's available.\n\nThe current date is 2024/02/21, but the function doesn't require any date parameters unless specified, so no need to use that.\n\nMy response should only be the function call in the specified JSON format. Since this seems to fulfill the request, I'll make one function call.\n\nFormat:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"func_name\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"param1\": \"value1\",\n\n      ...\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSo, for this:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"getDataForProfessional\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"service_id\": 2,\n\n      \"province_id\": 2,\n\n      \"district_name\": \"Sankampang\",\n\n      \"sub_district_name\": \"Ton Pao\",\n\n      \"rating\": 4.5\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nThat looks good.
