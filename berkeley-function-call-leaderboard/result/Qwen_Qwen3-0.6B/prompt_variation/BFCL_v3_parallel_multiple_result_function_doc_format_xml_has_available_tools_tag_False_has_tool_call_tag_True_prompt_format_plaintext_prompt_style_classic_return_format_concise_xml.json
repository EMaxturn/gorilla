So, I'll call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nNext, the linear regression fit. The function linear_regression_fit requires x and y arrays. The user specified x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']. But wait, data['sales'] and data['future_sales'] might be arrays. However, in Python, if the data is loaded as a DataFrame, these would be columns. But the function expects arrays. So I need to convert them into arrays. But the user hasn't specified if they want to use the data as arrays. Since the parameters require arrays, I should pass them as such. So, x would be the array of 'sales' values and y the array of 'future_sales'.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']\".

The get_artwork_price function takes a museum location, sculpture material, and size (as an array). \n\nSo, for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price.

The user mentioned the materials (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 ft and 6x3 ft). \n\nWait, the get_artwork_price function's parameters include sculpture_material and sculpture_size.

So the answer would be the two prices from the two calls, then take the average. \n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to make the function calls. So the correct approach is to call both functions and then process the results. However, since the user's question requires an average, but the functions don't have an average function, perhaps the answer is that the average price can't be determined without the actual data. But the user expects the answer, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the function calls as per the available tools."}

So I need to call that with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4.\n\nNext, the compound interest option. The initial investment is $5000, annual rate 3.5%, duration 5 years. The function is calc_Compound_Interest. So principle_amount=5000, annual_rate=3.5, duration=5, compound_freq=1 (since it's compounded annually).

The user wants to plan their meals for the day. They have three different parts: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each part has specific ingredients and calorie limits.\n\nFirst, for breakfast, they need eggs, milk, and bread. The calories should be under 300. So I should use the recipe_search function. The parameters needed are ingredients, calories, and meal type. The meal type here is breakfast, so I'll set that.\n\nNext, lunch. They want a restaurant with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce. The dishes should not exceed 500 calories. The restaurant_search function seems right here. The ingredients are chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, and the calories are 500. The meal type is lunch.\n\nThen, dinner. They want to replace beef with tofu and keep calories under 600. The ingredient_replace function is suitable. Original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and calories should be 600. The meal type here is dinner.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters. For recipe_search, ingredients and calories are required. For ingredient_replace, calories is required. The meal parameter is optional for each function. So each function call should include the necessary parameters. Let me structure each function call accordingly."}

First, they want to know the function of ATP in mitochondria with a specific function. Then, calculate the driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. After that, find the scientist for the theory of relativity, and finally get the price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish.\n\nStarting with the first part: ATP function in mitochondria. The user mentioned a specific function, so I need to use the cell_biology.function_lookup function. The parameters required are molecule, organelle, and specific_function. ATP is the molecule, mitochondria is the organelle, and specific_function should be true. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the driving distance. The user wants miles, so the unit parameter should be set to miles. The origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles. The function get_shortest_driving_distance needs origin and destination, and unit. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function requires the discovery. The user mentioned the theory of relativity, so I'll set discovery to that. Just call that function once.\n\nLastly, the Fender Stratocaster price in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function needs brand, model, and finish. The user specified Fender, Stratocaster, and sunburst. So that's the third function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted and required fields are included. Let me check each function again to confirm. Yes, all parameters are there. No missing info. So the final answer should include all these function calls in the specified format."}

The user has two main tasks here. First, modifying the painting's attributes and then predicting the evolutionary rate of an African elephant. Then, calculating the probability for a poker game.\n\nStarting with the painting modification. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant. The user wants to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, and red dominant. So I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size is 30x40, medium is oil, and dominant color is red. So the first function call should be modify_painting with those parameters.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The prediction.evolution function requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, model is Darwin. So another function call here.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The probability of getting a royal flush in a 52-card deck with 4 possible outcomes. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4. Rounded to 3 decimal places. So calculate_probability with those values and round_to 3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, check if all required parameters are included. The modify_painting function requires size, medium, and dominant_color. The user provided all three, so that's good. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years is integer, model is string. All correct. For the poker probability, total_outcomes is 52, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. All parameters are provided. So the three function calls should cover all parts."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, and built in 1985. So I need to use the predict_house_price function. Let me check the parameters: area, rooms, year, and location. All are provided, so that's straightforward.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, the county is San Francisco, and the state isn't specified. The default state is California, but since the user mentioned San Francisco county, maybe the state is California. Wait, the county is San Francisco, so the state might be California. But the function's county parameter is required. So I need to set county to \"San Francisco\" and maybe state to \"California\" if needed. But the user didn't mention the state, so perhaps just county as San Francisco. The function's county is a required parameter, so I'll include that.\n\nThird, the probability of winning the lottery. The parameters are total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5. The calculate_probability function requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user specified rounding to 3 decimal places, so round_to should be 3. So I need to call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nNow, I need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For the lawsuit_search, the entity is \"Mr. John Doe\", county is \"San Francisco\". For the lottery, total_outcomes is 1000, favorable is 5, round_to is 3. So each function call should be made with the correct parameters. Let me structure each function call in the required format."}

Next, details of Apple Inc. lawsuit in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: find fish in Animal Crossing. The function get_collectables_in_season is needed here. The parameters required are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so item_type should be 'fish'. The game is 'Animal Crossing', season 'Summer'. So that's one function call.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game is Fortnite, platform 'PlayStation', region 'Asia'. The function game_score.highest requires game, platform, and region. So that's another function call.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user mentioned Apple Inc. and year 2018, so those parameters are set. The case_type isn't specified, so it defaults to all. So that's the third function call.\n\nLastly, binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So all parameters are present. That's the fourth function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. Each function call should have the correct parameters.
