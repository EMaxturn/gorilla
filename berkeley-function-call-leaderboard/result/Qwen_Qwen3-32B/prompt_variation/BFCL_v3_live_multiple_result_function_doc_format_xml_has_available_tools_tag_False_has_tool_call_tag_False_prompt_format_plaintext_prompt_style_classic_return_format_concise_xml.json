The user is asking for an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc (string), type (string), and time (integer). The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. All required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2, its description says it's for finding weather at a location, which doesn't seem relevant here. Also, the parameters for ride2 require loc in 'City, State' format, but the user provided a full street address. Plus, the type parameter in ride2 is required, but the function's purpose is about weather, so that might be a mistake in the function setup. Since the user is asking for a ride, not weather, ride2 isn't appropriate here.\n\nTherefore, the correct function to use is uber.ride with the provided parameters. All required parameters are met: loc is correctly formatted, type is 'Plus', and time is 10. No missing parameters. So the function call should be made with these values."}

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include searching in recall memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user mentioned Shishir Patil, maybe the information is in the archival memory. I should use the archival_memory_search function with the query \"Shishir Patil birthday\".\n\nWait, the functions available are archival_memory_search and recall_memory_search. Let me check the parameters. The archival_memory_search uses a semantic search with embeddings, which might be better for finding specific info. Let me try that first.\n\nSo, call archival_memory_search with query \"Shishir Patil birthday\". If that doesn't return the birthday, maybe check the recall memory with the same query. Once I get the birthday date, I can use send_message to send a congratulation. The send_message function requires the message content and recipient. The user didn't specify the recipient's details, but maybe Shishir Patil's contact info is in the core memory. Alternatively, the user might expect me to send it to him directly, but without the recipient parameter, the message might not be sent properly. Hmm, but the user's instruction is to send the message, so perhaps they expect me to proceed with the message content once the birthday is known, even if the recipient isn't specified. Maybe the recipient is implied to be Shishir Patil, but I need his contact info. If the birthday is found, I can draft the message and maybe ask the user for the recipient details if needed. But according to the problem, I should use the functions provided. Since the user hasn't provided the recipient's details in the question, perhaps I should proceed with sending the message without the recipient, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the core memory has the human's details. Wait, the core memory's human sub-block stores key details about the user. But the user here is the one asking the question, not Shishir Patil. So maybe I need to assume that the user wants to send the message to Shishir Patil, but without his contact info, the send_message function can't be completed. However, the user's instruction is to send a congratulation message, so perhaps the answer should include the message content once the birthday is found, even if the recipient isn't specified. Let me proceed step by step: first search for the birthday, then compose the message."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the October 2019 statement period. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The BankStatementOverView function seems necessary because it provides an overview of the bank statement with account info. The parameters required are bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided the bank name (U.S. Bank), account number, account type (business checking), and full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING). The transaction overview would need a summary, which might come from another function.\n\nLooking at the transaction_summary.generate function, it requires transactions, dates, totals, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. The Alltransactions function could retrieve transactions for a period, but the user didn't mention needing individual transactions, just a summary. The TotalTransactions.calculate function could compute totals, but the user already provided deposit and withdrawal amounts. \n\nWait, the user already has the total deposits and withdrawals, so maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be used with the given totals. However, the transaction_summary requires a list of transactions, which the user hasn't provided. Hmm. The user might expect the summary to be generated from the totals they provided. But the function parameters for transaction_summary.generate require an array of transactions. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe we can't use that function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview parameter can be a summary dict with the totals provided. The user mentioned \"summary of transactions,\" so perhaps the transaction_overview can include the total deposits, withdrawals, and other details. The BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict, so we can structure it with the given totals. \n\nSo, for BankStatementOverView, the parameters would be:\n- bank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n- account_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n- account_type: \"checking\" (since it's a business checking account)\n- full_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n- transaction_overview: a dict containing starting_balance, ending_balance, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, and maybe the period dates.\n\nThe dates for the statement period are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The starting_date and ending_date in the transaction_overview could be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' (2019-10-01 and 2019-10-31). \n\nSo the transaction_overview dict would include:\n- starting_date: \"2019-10-01\"\n- ending_date: \"2019-10-31\"\n- starting_balance: 5532.01\n- ending_balance: 6737.37\n- total_deposits: 7132.76\n- total_withdrawals: 5927.40\n\nThat should cover the required parameters for BankStatementOverView. The user didn't mention pending transactions, so maybe that's not needed. \n\nI don't think any other functions are necessary here. The user wants an overview and a summary, which the BankStatementOverView can provide with the given data. The other functions like TransactionsV2 or Alltransactions aren't needed because individual transactions aren't required for the summary in this case."}

The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. It requires category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate price, which I can map to a price range. The location is New York, but the function expects 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and state is NY, I'll use 'New York, NY'. They also want outdoor seating, so set has_seating_outdoors to true. The category isn't specified, but it's a required parameter. Hmm, maybe the user didn't mention it, so I should leave it out? Wait, no, the function requires 'category' as mandatory. Oh, but the user didn't provide that. So I need to handle that. Wait, the user's query doesn't mention a specific cuisine, so maybe I can leave it as a default or omit it? But the function requires it. Wait, looking back at the function definition for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the 'category' is required. So the user's request is missing that parameter. But the user hasn't specified a category. So maybe I can't proceed without that info. Wait, but the user might not know the category. However, the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant should ask for the category, but the user hasn't provided it. Wait, but the current task is to make the function call if possible. Since the category is required and not provided, the function can't be called. But the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. So maybe the category can be left as a default or omitted? Wait, no, the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without the category. But the user hasn't provided it. So in this case, the assistant should point out that the category is missing. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the user wants me to make the function call if possible. Wait, but the category is required. So the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. But the user's question doesn't mention a category. So perhaps the assistant should respond that the required parameter 'category' is missing. However, the user might expect that the category is optional. Wait, looking back at the function definition: the 'category' is required. So the assistant must include it. Since the user hasn't provided it, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the 'category' parameter is missing. But the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Maybe the assistant can assume a default category, but the function doesn't allow that. Therefore, the answer is that the function can't be called because 'category' is missing. However, the user might not have specified the category, so the assistant should ask for it. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct action is to indicate that the 'category' is a required parameter that's missing. But the user's question is in the context of finding restaurants, so maybe the assistant can proceed by making an assumption, but the function requires it. Therefore, the answer is that the function can't be called because 'category' is missing. However, the user's original question doesn't mention the category. So the assistant should respond that the required parameter 'category' is missing. Therefore, the correct function call can't be made, and the assistant should point out the missing parameter. But the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the 'category' is required but not provided. However, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. So maybe the assistant can proceed by using a default category, but the function requires it. Therefore, the correct answer is to point out the missing 'category' parameter. Therefore, the assistant can't make the function call and must indicate that the 'category' is missing. However, the user's question might have intended to not specify the category, so the assistant should handle that. But according to the function's parameters, 'category' is required. Therefore, the assistant must point out that the 'category' is missing. So the final answer is that the function can't be called because the 'category' parameter is missing."}

Since the user is asking to \"book,\" it sounds like they want to reserve a hotel, so Hotels_4_ReserveHotel might be the right choice. But wait, do they need to search first? The user didn't specify a hotel name, so maybe they need to search first. However, the user's message says \"book,\" which implies they already have a hotel in mind. But the problem is, they didn't mention the hotel name. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user might be assuming they already found a hotel and just need to book it. But since the hotel name isn't provided, maybe I need to first search for available hotels. Let me check the parameters. The Hotels_4_ReserveHotel requires place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location, and number_of_rooms. The user provided the check-in date as July 15th (2023-07-15?), stay length 5 days, but no location. Wait, the user didn't mention the location. They just said \"go to the studio sessions,\" but where is the studio? The user hasn't specified the city or location. Without the location, I can't proceed with either the reserve or search function. So the missing parameter here is the location. The user hasn't provided the city where the hotel is located. Therefore, I can't make a function call because the required parameters are missing. The Hotels_4_ReserveHotel requires location, and the user hasn't given that. So I need to inform them that the location is missing. But the user might have expected that the location is known from previous context. Wait, looking back, the user hasn't mentioned any previous conversation. So in this case, the necessary parameters for the hotel reservation are missing: location and place_name. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the required parameters are missing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to provide the location in their message but forgot. Since the user's message is a bit unclear, the assistant should identify that the location is a required parameter and is missing. Therefore, the answer is that the function can't be called due to missing parameters."}

The user wants to search for a 4-star hotel in Sydney, Australia that allows smoking and has two rooms available. First, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are Hotels_4_SearchHotel and Hotels_4_ReserveHotel. Since the user is asking to search for a hotel, not reserve yet, the correct function is Hotels_4_SearchHotel.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Hotels_4_SearchHotel: location is required. The user specified Sydney, Australia, so location should be \"Sydney, AU\". Star rating is 4, so star_rating is \"4\". Smoking allowed is a boolean, and the user wants smoking allowed, so smoking_allowed is true. Number of rooms is mentioned as two, but the parameter description says it can be a positive integer or 'dontcare'. So number_of_rooms should be \"2\".\n\nWait, the number_of_rooms in the function is for reserving, but the user is searching. However, the function's param for number_of_rooms is optional and can be used to specify the number of rooms they want to reserve. But the user's question says \"has two rooms available\". Hmm, does the search function allow specifying available rooms? The parameter description says \"the number of hotel rooms to reserve\", not available. So maybe the user is looking for hotels that have at least two rooms available. But the function might not support filtering by available rooms. The parameter is for how many the user wants to reserve, not the hotel's availability. So maybe the user just wants to reserve two rooms once they find a hotel. So in the search, maybe the number_of_rooms isn't needed. But the user's question says \"has two rooms available\", which is about the hotel's availability. If the function doesn't have a parameter for available rooms, then we can't specify that. The function's parameters don't include a way to check available rooms, only the number to reserve. So perhaps the user's requirement is to reserve two rooms once a hotel is found, but during the search, we can't specify availability. So in the search, we can set number_of_rooms to \"2\" to indicate that when reserving, they need two, but the search itself might not filter based on that. Alternatively, maybe the number_of_rooms in the search function is for how many rooms the hotel has available. But according to the function's description, it's \"the number of hotel rooms to reserve\". So perhaps the user's mention of two rooms is about how many they want to reserve, not the hotel's availability. Therefore, in the search function, we can include number_of_rooms as \"2\" to indicate that when reserving, they need two rooms. But the function's number_of_rooms is optional. So the parameters would be location: \"Sydney, AU\", star_rating: \"4\", smoking_allowed: true, number_of_rooms: \"2\". \n\nI think that's the correct approach.

The user mentioned \"debit card\" as the payment method, so that's the source. The amount is $154. The receiver is the landlord's email.

The PlayMedia function requires a track, artist, device, or album. But the user isn't specifying a particular track; they want either from the album or from 2019. So maybe first, I need to look up the songs that match their criteria. \n\nThe LookupMusic function allows searching by album, artist, genre, or year. Since the user mentioned the album 'High Expectations' and songs from 2019, I can use LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year 2019. But wait, the parameters for LookupMusic are artist, album, genre, year. Each is optional but can be specified. So I can set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019. However, if I set both, does it mean the song has to be from that album and year, or either? The user's request is for either/or. Hmm. The user might want songs from the album OR from 2019. But the function parameters are separate fields. Maybe the system will handle it as OR, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I need to make two separate calls. But the user might want a single list. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a track from the album first, and if not available, then play something from 2019. But the user's message is a bit ambiguous. However, the functions available are LookupMusic and PlayMedia. Since the user hasn't specified a particular track, perhaps the assistant needs to first look up the songs that match either the album or the year. But the LookupMusic function can take multiple parameters. If I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, the system might return songs that are in that album OR from 2019. Or maybe it's an AND condition. The description says \"match the user's specified preferences such as artist, album, genre, and release year.\" The wording suggests that each parameter is an additional filter. So if both album and year are provided, it would look for songs that match both. But the user wants either. So perhaps the correct approach is to make two separate lookups: one for the album and one for the year. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the LookupMusic function with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 'dontcare', and then another call with album as 'dontcare' and year 2019. But the user might prefer a single call. However, the function parameters don't allow for OR logic. So perhaps the best approach is to first look up songs from the album 'High Expectations' and if there are none, then look up songs from 2019. But the user's request is to play a track from either, so maybe the assistant should first try to find songs from the album, and if that's not possible, then find from 2019. However, the user might want both options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the LookupMusic function with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 2019, assuming that the system will return songs that are in the album or from the year. But if the system's logic is AND, then it might not return anything if the album's songs aren't from 2019. For example, if 'High Expectations' is an album from 2018, then the lookup would return nothing. But the user wants either. So perhaps the correct approach is to make two separate lookups. However, the user's message is a single request, so maybe the assistant should first try to find songs from the album, and if there are none, then proceed to find from 2019. But the user might want both options. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the assistant should probably first use LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 'dontcare' to find songs from that album. If there are songs, then play one. If not, then use LookupMusic with year 2019. But the user's message is a single request, so maybe the assistant should first call LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 2019, and then if no results, adjust parameters. However, the user might want to have both options considered. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant can call LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare', and another call with album 'dontcare' and year 2019. Then combine the results. But the user might not want that. \n\nGiven the available functions, the best approach is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 'dontcare'. If that returns songs, then use Music_3_PlayMedia to play one. If not, then call Music_3_LookupMusic with year 2019. However, the user's message is a single request, so the assistant should probably make the first call to LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 2019. Wait, but the user said \"or alternatively, any song that came out in 2019\". So the user is giving two options: either from the album or from 2019. So the assistant should look for songs that are in the album OR from 2019. But the LookupMusic function's parameters are separate, so perhaps the assistant can't combine them as OR. Therefore, the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the user might not want that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the LookupMusic function with album 'High Expectations' and year 2019, assuming that the system will return songs that are in the album or from the year. But if the system's logic is AND, then it's not correct. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the assistant should proceed with the first possible step: use LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare' to find songs from that album. If there are songs, then play one. If not, then proceed to look up songs from 2019. \n\nSo the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 'dontcare'. Then, if there are results, use PlayMedia. If not, then call LookupMusic with year 2019. \n\nBut the user's message is a single request, so the assistant should make the first call to LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare'. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and year 'dontcare'."}

The parameters required are from_city, to_city, departure_date, and optionally num_passengers and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles (though maybe they should specify the state, but since it's common knowledge that LA is in CA, maybe it's okay), departure_date is March 10, 2023. They mentioned traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1. The category isn't specified, so we can leave that out. \n\nWait, the departure_date format for Buses_3_FindBus is MM/DD/YYYY. The user wrote \"10th of March 2023\", which would be 03/10/2023. But March 10th is the 10th day of the third month, so MM/DD/YYYY would be 03/10/2023. However, sometimes people might write the date as 10th March, but the function requires the correct format. So I need to make sure the date is formatted correctly. The user's input is \"10th of march 2023\", so converting that to MM/DD/YYYY would be 03/10/2023. \n\nSo the parameters would be from_city: \"Fresno, CA\", to_city: \"Los Angeles, CA\", departure_date: \"03/10/2023\", num_passengers: 1. The category is optional, so we can omit it. \n\nI should check if the to_city is properly formatted. The user said \"Los Angeles\", but the example in the function's parameters shows \"Los Angeles, CA\". So it's better to include the state abbreviation. So to_city should be \"Los Angeles, CA\". \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Buses_3_FindBus with those parameters. The other functions like Buses_3_BuyBusTicket require departure_time, which the user hasn't provided yet. Since they're just looking for an itinerary, not purchasing tickets yet, FindBus is the right choice. The Hotels functions aren't relevant here. \n\nSo the final function call should include from_city, to_city, departure_date, and num_passengers. All required parameters are present, and the optional ones are handled appropriately."}

The user wants to book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA for May 15, 2023, starting one day before, and include trip protection.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The train-related functions are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. The user is asking to book tickets, so the GetTrainTickets function is probably needed. Let me look at its parameters.\n\nThe parameters required for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and optionally _class. The user specified the origin (Portland, OR), destination (Seattle, WA), date (May 15, 2023), and starting one day before. Wait, starting one day before might refer to the journey_start_time. But the date_of_journey is May 15, so maybe the journey starts on that date. However, the user says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe that's a typo or confusion. Alternatively, perhaps they mean the departure time is the day before the journey date? That's a bit unclear. But the date_of_journey is required, so I'll use May 15, 2023. The journey_start_time is needed in 24-hour format. The user didn't specify the exact time, so maybe I need to assume a default or leave it as a required parameter. Wait, the function requires journey_start_time, so I can't omit it. Since the user didn't provide it, maybe I should point out that the parameter is missing. But the user might have intended the date as May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the check-in date for the train, but trains usually depart on the specified date. This is a bit confusing. \n\nAssuming the date_of_journey is May 15, and the journey_start_time is not provided, but the function requires it. The user hasn't given the time, so I can't proceed without that. However, maybe the user made a mistake and the actual date is May 14. But the question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014so perhaps the journey is on May 15, but the start time is the day before? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user meant the check-in date for the train is one day before, but the journey date is May 15. But the function parameters don't have a check-in date, only date_of_journey and journey_start_time. \n\nThis is a problem. The function requires date_of_journey and journey_start_time. The user hasn't provided the start time, so I can't fill that in. Also, the date might be ambiguous. However, the user might have intended the journey to be on May 15, with the start time not specified. Since the function requires journey_start_time, I need to have that. Since it's not provided, I can't proceed. But maybe the user expects me to use a default time, but the function doesn't mention that. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended the date as May 14, but the question says \"journey on May 15\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the date. But according to the question, the journey is on May 15, starting one day before. That's conflicting. So perhaps the user wants to travel on May 14, but the date is written as May 15. This is unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I should proceed with the information provided. The date_of_journey is May 15, 2023. The journey_start_time is required but not provided. Therefore, the function call can't be made without that parameter. However, the user might have intended to provide the start time as the day before, but that's not possible because the date is fixed. \n\nWait, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14, but wrote May 15. If I proceed with May 14, then the date_of_journey would be 2023-05-14. But the user's question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014so perhaps the journey is on May 15, but the start time is the day before? That doesn't make sense. \n\nIn this case, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (yes), and date_of_journey is May 15, 2023. But journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called without that parameter. \n\nSo the correct response is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide that, but it's not in the question. Therefore, the function call can't be made. But the user is asking to book the tickets, so maybe I should proceed with the available parameters and assume a default time? But the function requires it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the date is actually May 14. If I proceed with May 14, then the date_of_journey is 2023-05-14, and the journey_start_time is not provided. Still missing. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the function can't be called because journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide that, but it's not in the question. So the assistant should point out that the journey_start_time is required but not provided. \n\nBut the user's question says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe that refers to the journey_start_time being the day before the date_of_journey. But that's not possible because the date_of_journey is the date of the journey. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the date. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are not fully provided. The journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called. The assistant should point out that the journey_start_time is required but not provided. However, the user might have intended to provide that, but it's not in the question. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the journey_start_time is missing."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which requires a user_id. The user provided that, so I can call this function with user_id=12345. The include_revoked parameter is optional, but the user didn't mention revoked tokens, so maybe leave it out or set to false.\n\nThen, there's api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. This function has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so setting include_expired=true might be necessary to get expired ones too. However, without pagination parameters, the default page and page_size might retrieve a limited set. But since the user wants \"all,\" maybe we need to handle pagination, but the function doesn't specify how to get all pages. The user might need to call multiple times with different page numbers, but since the user is demanding all now, perhaps just call it with include_expired=true and a large page_size, but the max is 100. However, if there are more than 100 tokens, this might not get all. But given the user's urgency, maybe proceed with the first call and note that if there are more, they might need to paginate. But the user hasn't specified any further details, so proceed with the available info.\n\nWait, the user's user ID is 12345, but the second function (get_api_tokens) doesn't take a user_id parameter. It's possible that the user is authenticated via the API token itself, so maybe the user ID is already known. However, the first function does require the user_id. So, the user might need both functions called. But the second function's parameters don't include user_id, so perhaps it's for the current authenticated user. Since the user provided their user ID, maybe they want tokens for that specific user. But if the second function doesn't take user_id, perhaps it's not applicable here. So, maybe only the first function is needed here. Wait, the first function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" while the second is just \"API tokens.\" The user might need both types. But the user's message is urgent, so perhaps call both functions. For the first function, use user_id=12345. For the second, since there's no user_id parameter, maybe it's for the current user, but the user provided their ID, so maybe it's not needed. Alternatively, maybe the second function is for the same user, but the user_id isn't a parameter. This is a bit unclear. The user might need both functions called. Let me proceed to call both functions. For the first, use user_id=12345. For the second, set include_expired=true to get all tokens, including expired ones. The page and page_size can be left out, but if the default page_size is less than the total number of tokens, the user might not get all. But without knowing the total, it's best to proceed with the given parameters. So, the function calls would be:\n\n1. CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345\n2. api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=true\n\nThat should cover both shareable and regular tokens, including expired ones."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's \"detail_experience_and_education\" and \"experiences_and_education\". The \"detail_experience_and_education\" function requires a type (like internship, freelance, education) and optionally a name. The user specified \"education\" and the university name, so maybe that's the one. The parameters for \"detail_experience_and_education\" include \"experience_or_education_type\" which should be set to \"education\" and \"experience_or_education_name\" as \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". \n\nAlternatively, the \"experiences_and_education\" function retrieves a list, but the user is asking for specific details, so the \"detail_experience_and_education\" seems more appropriate. Let me check the parameters again. The \"detail_experience_and_education\" function's \"experience_or_education_type\" is required, and the name is optional but here the user provided the university name, so including that would help get the specific detail. \n\nSo the correct function call would be to \"detail_experience_and_education\" with type \"education\" and name \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\"."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the set_alarm function. It requires an alarm_time parameter in a specific format. The user mentioned the date as \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Wait, \"tomorro\" is probably a typo for \"tomorrow\". But the date given is 2023-12-1. I need to confirm if that's the correct date. Since the user specified the date explicitly, I'll use that. The time is 7:00 AM. The function accepts time in 12-hour format with AM/PM. So combining the date and time, the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. \n\nThe purpose is optional, but the user mentioned it's for a meeting, so I can include that as the purpose. \n\nThe other function is set_countdown, but that's for a duration, not a specific time, so it's not suitable here. \n\nI need to make sure the date format is correct. The function's example includes '2023-06-01 09:30:00', so using '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' should be acceptable. \n\nSo the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' and purpose 'meeting'."}
