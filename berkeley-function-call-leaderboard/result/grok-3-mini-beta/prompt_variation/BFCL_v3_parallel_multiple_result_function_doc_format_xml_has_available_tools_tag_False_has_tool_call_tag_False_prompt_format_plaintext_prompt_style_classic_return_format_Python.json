Wait, I can't; I have to use the value if I know it, but I don't. Hmm.\n\nThis is a problem. In the function call format, I need to provide the parameters directly. I can't say \"use the output of the previous function.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to call them in sequence, and the system will pass the outputs.\n\nBut the instructions don't specify that.
