They mentioned straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the functions available, there's one called calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters. It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. No mention of rounding, so maybe I can omit that or set it to a default. Since the parameters are all there, I can call the function with those values. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct tool call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with the given values."}

They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are given here as 20 meters and 4 seconds. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's optional and the function's description says it starts from rest, maybe it's not needed. Let me check the function's parameters again. The 'initial_speed' is required as false, so I can omit it. So the correct call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4). That should compute the final speed."}

There's find_exhibition, which locates exhibitions based on location, art form, time, and ratings. The parameters required are location, art_form, month, and user_ratings. \n\nThe user specified \"modern sculpture\" as the art form, so art_form should be \"sculpture\". The location is New York. The month is upcoming, so maybe leave it as default or set it to the current month. But the parameter says the default returns upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is better. Also, they want top-rated, so user_ratings should be set to 'high' or the default, which is 'high'. \n\nWait, the user_ratings parameter's default is 'high', so even if not specified, it would default to high ratings. So the function call would be find_exhibition with location=\"New York\", art_form=\"sculpture\", and maybe month as default. But the user mentioned \"upcoming month\", so perhaps setting month to the current month? However, the parameter's default is to return upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is okay. \n\nSo the correct function call is find_exhibition(location=\"New York\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\"). But since user_ratings defaults to 'high', maybe it's redundant to include it. But including it explicitly ensures clarity. Alternatively, the system might require it. Let me check the parameters again. The user_ratings parameter is optional with a default of 'high', so including it isn't necessary.
