The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight line motion, so I should use the kinematics functions provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for displacement when there's initial speed, acceleration, and time. The formula is displacement = initial_speed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. That's from the equations of motion. \n\nLooking at the functions available, there's 'calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters here are all provided: initial_speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2 decimal places.\n\nSo I should call the calculate_displacement function with those values. Let me check the parameters again to make sure. Yes, all required parameters are present. No missing info. The user didn't mention anything about rounding, so just use the default. \n\nI don't need to use the calculate_final_speed function here because the question is about displacement, not final speed.

The user provided all three: game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call store_price with those parameters.

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going when it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are some kinematic equations. The problem mentions starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. The function provided is calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check the parameters for that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default=0). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. Since it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, which is the default. So I can use the calculate_speed_from_rest function with distance=20 and time=4. The function should compute the final speed. I don't need the acceleration function here because the question is about speed, not acceleration. Wait, the function calculate_speed_from_rest probably uses the equation v = u + at, but since u is 0, and maybe uses the distance formula. Alternatively, maybe it uses v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as. But the function's parameters include time, so maybe it's using the equation s = ut + 0.5at\u00b2 and then finding v = at. But regardless, the function is designed for this scenario. So the correct call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is default, so no need to specify. Let me make sure there's no missing parameters. The function requires distance and time, both are provided. So the answer is to call that function with those values."}

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're the same gas, maybe it's a weighted average? Wait, the formula for final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas would be (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nSo, the formula would be T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2). That makes sense because the total \"thermal energy\" is conserved. Since the gas is the same, the molar heat capacities would be the same, so they cancel out. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2.

Let me think about which function to use here. The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about rolling dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, and there's n_rolls and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a sum of 7 on two dice. So desired_sum should be 7. The default for n_rolls is 1, but since they're rolling two dice, I need to set n_rolls=2. The sides_per_die isn't specified, but standard dice have 6 sides, so I'll assume that. Wait, the user didn't mention the number of sides, but the function requires it.

Default is 1\n    sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die.\n\nSo sides_per_die is required? Wait, no. The parameters are listed as desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die.

Wait, in the function's Args, the parameters are listed as:\n\ndesired_sum (int): required\nn_rolls (int): default is 1\nsides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die.\n\nWait, the sides_per_die is not given a default. So the user must provide it. But the user's question doesn't mention it. So maybe the function expects the user to provide it. However, in the problem statement, the user is talking about standard dice, so maybe the function has a default of 6. But since the function's parameters don't specify a default, perhaps the user must include it. But the user hasn't provided it. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, but maybe the function's parameters have defaults that aren't shown here. Wait, looking back at the function's code:\n\nThe function is written as:\n\n# Function: dice_roll_probability\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the probability of a specific sum appearing from rolling two dice. \n\n    Args:\n        desired_sum (int): The sum for which to calculate the probability.\n        n_rolls (int): Number of dice to be rolled.

But in the Args, n_rolls has a default, but sides_per_die does not. So the function requires sides_per_die to be provided. However, the user's question doesn't mention it. So maybe the user is assuming standard 6-sided dice. Therefore, I should include sides_per_die=6. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the function expects it. Therefore, the correct call would be dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6). \n\nAlternatively, if the function's sides_per_die has a default of 6, but the documentation doesn't say so. Since the user's question doesn't mention it, but the function requires it, I need to include it. So the answer should include sides_per_die=6.
