The user didn't mention weather, so maybe just using 'uber.ride' is sufficient.\n\nWait, the 'uber.ride2' function has a 'time' parameter with a default of 10. But the user specified 10 minutes, so even if the default is 10, it's okay. But the user's request is about the ride, not weather.

The user wants to know Shishir Patil's birthday and send a contraguation message. First, I need to check if I have the birthday information. Since the user hasn't provided any data about Shishir Patil, I can't retrieve the birthday from core memory or archival memory. The functions available include send_message, pause_heartbeats, message_chatgpt, core_memory_append, core_memory_replace, recall_memory_search, archival_memory_insert, and archival_memory_search. None of these functions can fetch personal information like a birthday. \n\nNext, the user wants a contraguation message. Contraguation is a type of message, but I need to check if there's a function for that. The available functions are send_message, which is for sending a personalized message. The message_chatgpt function sends a message to ChatGPT, but the user might not want that. The send_message function can be used here, but I need to make sure the message is crafted properly. However, the user hasn't provided the birthday, so I can't generate the message without that info. \n\nSince the birthday isn't available, I can't proceed with the contraguation message. The user might need to provide the birthday or the assistant should inform them that the information isn't available. But according to the instructions, if the required parameters are missing, I should indicate that. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the send_message function with a placeholder or generate a message without the birthday. But the assistant's inner monologue must be under 50 words. \n\nWait, the user's request is to send a message, but without the birthday, the assistant can't do that. So the correct approach is to inform the user that the birthday isn't available and that the message can't be sent. But the functions don't include a way to check the birthday. Therefore, the assistant can't fulfill the request. The answer should state that the birthday isn't available and that the message can't be sent. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the send_message function with a default message. But since the birthday is required, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nSo, the steps are: 1. Check if birthday is in core or archival memory. 2. If not, inform the user. 3. If yes, proceed to send the message. Since the birthday isn't available, the assistant can't send the message. Therefore, the answer is that the birthday isn't available and the message can't be sent."}

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending at $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these details: bank_name is U.S. Bank, account_number is given, account_type is checking, full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided the beginning and ending balances, which are part of the transaction_overview. Wait, the parameters for BankStatementOverView require starting_date and ending_date, which the user provided. The user also mentioned the beginning balance and ending balance, but the transaction_overview might need those as part of the summary. However, the parameters for BankStatementOverView don't include starting_balance and ending_balance directly. Wait, the parameters for transaction_overview include total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, which are $7,132.76 and $5,927.40. The starting balance is $5,532.01 and ending is $6,737.37. But the transaction_overview's parameters don't have starting_balance or ending_balance. So maybe the transaction_overview is supposed to include the totals and dates, and the starting and ending balances are part of the overview. But the user's question also asks for a summary of transactions, which would include the individual transactions. However, the available functions might not have a function to generate the summary directly. Wait, there's the transaction_summary.generate function, which requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and names. But the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details. They only provided the total deposits and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be used if we have the individual transactions. But the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, only the totals. So perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is the main one to call first, and then the transaction_summary.generate can be used with the totals and the names. But the user's question also asks for a summary of transactions, which might require the individual transactions. However, the available functions don't have a function to list individual transactions. The user might need to use the BankStatementOverView to get the overview and then use the transaction_summary.generate with the totals and names. But the transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. So maybe the answer is to call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters and then note that the transaction summary requires more details. But the user might expect both the overview and the summary. However, given the functions available, the BankStatementOverView is the first step, and then the transaction_summary.generate would need the transactions array, which isn't provided. So perhaps the answer is to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and mention that the transaction summary requires more details. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the totals and names, but the transactions array is missing. So the user might need to be informed that the transaction summary can't be generated without the individual transaction details. But the user's question also includes the total deposits and withdrawals, so maybe the answer is to call BankStatementOverView and then note that the transaction summary requires more data."}

So if the user wants the full tech stack, we need to set include_tools=True. Therefore, in the function call, we should set include_tools=True. But the user didn't mention that. However, the function's description says it includes tools, so maybe the default is False, and the user needs to specify include_tools=True. Therefore, the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id='Adriel', include_tools=True). But the user didn't specify that, so maybe the function's default is False. But the user is asking for the tech stack, which includes tools. Therefore, to get the full tech stack, we need to set include_tools=True. So the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id='Adriel', include_tools=True). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is to include tools. But according to the parameters, the default is False. So I think the correct call is to set include_tools=True. Therefore, the function call is get_tech_stack(employee_id='Adriel', include_tools=True)."}

The other functions like get_project_by_name_and_version or update_project don't directly answer the version question. The badge functions also don't provide version info. So the correct function here is get_version from the version_api. No parameters are needed, so the call is just get_version().\n\nI should make sure there's no missing info.

The available functions are Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants and RideSharing_2_GetRide. Since the user is asking about restaurants, the Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the required ones are category and location. The user specified \"intermediate priced\" which is part of the category. The enum for category includes 'moderate' as a default, but the user wants intermediate. Wait, the enum list includes 'moderate' but the user says \"intermediate priced\". Hmm, the enum values are listed, but the user's term isn't exactly in the enum. Wait, the enum for category includes 'moderate' and others. The user says \"intermediate priced\", but the enum has 'moderate' as a default. Maybe the user is referring to 'moderate' as intermediate. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo. But since the user specified \"intermediate\", but the enum doesn't have that, perhaps the closest is 'moderate'. But the user might have meant 'moderate' as intermediate. Alternatively, maybe the function allows a custom value, but according to the parameters, the category is an enum. So I need to check if 'intermediate' is in the enum. Looking back, the enum for category includes 'moderate' and others, but not 'intermediate'. So the user's request might not match exactly. However, the user might have intended 'moderate' as the price range. So I'll proceed with 'moderate' as the category. \n\nThe location is New York, which needs to be in the format 'City, State'. So 'New York, NY' is correct. The user also wants outdoor seating, so the has_seating_outdoors parameter should be set to True. The default for has_seating_outdoors is False, so we need to include it. \n\nSo the parameters would be category='moderate', location='New York, NY', has_seating_outdoors=True. The other parameters like price_range are not needed since the user specified intermediate, which is the default for 'moderate'. Wait, the price_range has a default of 'moderate', so maybe that's already covered. But the user wants intermediate priced, which might not be the same as 'moderate'. However, since the enum for category includes 'moderate' and the user's request is about price, perhaps the category is 'moderate' and the price_range is 'moderate' as default. But the user's exact wording is \"intermediate priced\", which might not match the enum. But given the available options, I'll proceed with 'moderate' as the category and let the default price_range handle it. \n\nSo the function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with category='moderate', location='New York, NY', has_seating_outdoors=True.

Wait, the parameters for ReserveHotel have 'place_name' and 'location' as required, but their defaults are 'dontcare'. The user hasn't specified the exact location, so maybe I need to ask for that. But the user said \"studio sessions,\" which might be a location. However, the function's parameters require the place_name and location. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, maybe I need to use the default values, but the default is 'dontcare', which is not helpful. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use the location as 'Studio Sessions' or something similar. But the function's parameters are a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the location as the city where the studio is, but without knowing the exact city, I can't proceed. Wait, the user might have a specific location in mind, but they didn't mention it. Maybe I need to ask for the location. But the user's message is in the context of booking a hotel for studio sessions, so perhaps the location is the city where the studio is. However, without knowing the exact city, I can't fill in the parameters. \n\nWait, looking back at the parameters for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel: the required parameters are place_name and location. The user hasn't provided these, so maybe I need to use the default values, but the default is 'dontcare', which is not helpful. This seems like a problem. Maybe the user expects me to use the location as 'Studio Sessions' or similar, but that's not a real place.

Wait, the original query says \"stay for 5 days\" starting on July 15th. So the check-in date is July 15th, and the stay is 5 days, ending on July 19th. The stay_length is 5 days. \n\nSo the parameters for ReserveHotel would be: place_name (unknown), location (unknown), check_in_date (July 15th), stay_length (5). But the function requires place_name and location. Since the user hasn't provided these, maybe I need to use the default values, but that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the location as the city where the studio is, but without knowing the city, I can't proceed. Therefore, perhaps the function can't be called without more information. But the user is asking for help, so maybe I need to proceed with the available info and assume that the location is the city where the studio is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific location, but they didn't mention it. So perhaps the function can't be called as is. But the user is expecting a response. \n\nWait, looking at the parameters again: the 'place_name' and 'location' are required, but their defaults are 'dontcare'. So maybe the user expects me to use the location as the city where the studio is, but since it's not provided, I can't. Therefore, the function can't be called without more info. But the user is asking for help, so maybe I need to proceed with the available info and use the default values, even though they are 'dontcare'. But that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific location, like \"Studio Sessions, City\" but that's not specified. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The user hasn't provided the necessary parameters for the function. Therefore, I need to inform them that the required parameters are missing. But the user might have intended to provide them, but maybe they forgot. \n\nWait, the user's message is: \"I know I can count on you to help me find a hotel so I can go to the studio sessions. book on the 15th of July, 2ndaying for 5 days?\" Maybe \"2ndaying\" is a typo, perhaps \"2 nights\"? So the stay is 2 nights, starting on July 15th, ending on July 16th. But the user wrote \"5 days\" but maybe it's a typo. \n\nAssuming that the user meant 2 nights, then check_in_date is July 15th, stay_length is 2 days. But the user wrote \"5 days\" so maybe they meant 5 days. \n\nBut regardless, the function requires place_name and location. Since the user hasn't provided these, I can't call the function. Therefore, the answer would be that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to provide them, but they didn't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific location, like \"Studio Sessions\" as the place_name and location. But that's not a real place. \n\nIn this case, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameters are missing. But the user might have intended to provide them.

The 'accepts_insurance' has a default of False, but the user didn't specify that, so it's okay to leave it as default. \n\nSo the function call should be Services_4_FindProvider with city='Vacaville, CA' and type='Psychologist'. That should retrieve the list of Psychologists in Vacaville. Once they get that list, they can book an appointment with one of them. But the user's current request is just to find the providers, so this function call should suffice."}

That seems relevant here because it's for roundtrip flights. The parameters required are origin_airport, destination_airport, departure_date, return_date, seating_class, number_of_tickets, and airlines. \n\nThe user didn't specify seating class or airlines, so I'll use the defaults: Economy class and dontcare for airlines.

The other functions like Hotels_2_BookHouse or Travel_1_FindAttractions aren't relevant for this request. \n\nI should check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The origin_airport is \"ATL\" (IATA code for Atlanta) or \"Atlanta, GA\"? The function's description says it can take the name of the airport or city. But the parameters for origin_airport are a string, so maybe it's better to use the IATA code. However, the user specified Atlanta, GA, so maybe the function can handle that. But the function's parameters for origin_airport are a string, so either \"Atlanta, GA\" or \"ATL\" would work. But the example in the parameters shows \"JFK\" for origin_airport, so maybe the function expects the IATA code. However, the user provided the city name, so perhaps it's better to use \"Atlanta, GA\" as the origin_airport. But the function's parameters don't specify that. Hmm. But the user's input is \"Atlanta, GA\" as the origin, so maybe the function can accept that. \n\nBut the function's parameters for origin_airport are a string, so it's acceptable. So the function call would be:\n\nFlights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights(origin_airport=\"Atlanta, GA\", destination_airport=\"Boston, MA\", departure_date=\"2023-03-12\", return_date=\"2023-03-19\")\n\nThat should cover the user's request. The other parameters are default, so they don't need to be specified. The user didn't mention any specific preferences, so the defaults are fine."}

The first function is for looking up songs similar to 'The New Classic' album, and the second is for tracks from 2017.

So if I set album='The New Classic' and year=2017, that would return songs from the album and from 2017. But the user wants songs similar to the album (so the album's songs) and tracks from 2017. So maybe the function can handle both. But the user might want two separate results. However, the function can be called once with both parameters. \n\nSo the correct function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. That should cover both the album and the year. Then, the user might need another call if they want more details, but based on the given functions, that's the only one available. \n\nI think that's it.

The user wants to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. So, I need to figure out which functions to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. The user wants to play a song, so maybe PlayMedia? But they also want to check for songs from 2019. The LookupMusic function can retrieve songs based on artist, album, genre, year. The user mentioned the album 'High Expectations' and the year 2019. \n\nWait, the user said \"or alternatively, any song that came out in 2019.\" So they might want to first check the album and then if not found, any 2019 song. But how to structure that with the functions. \n\nThe Music_3_LookupMusic can take album and year parameters. So first, use LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year=2019. If there are results, then play one of them using PlayMedia. If not, then use LookupMusic with year=2019 and maybe a different album or artist. But the user didn't specify an artist, so maybe just use the year parameter. \n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a track from the album\" or \"any song from 2019.\" So maybe the first step is to look up songs from 2019, and if there are any, play one. But the functions don't have a way to select a random one. However, the user might just want to play one of them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from the album first, and if that's not possible, then play a 2019 song. But the functions don't have a way to select between options. So perhaps the best approach is to use LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year=2019. If there are results, then play one. If not, then use LookupMusic with year=2019 and play one. \n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a track from the album\" or \"any song from 2019.\" So maybe the system should first check the album and then the year. But since the functions are separate, perhaps the user wants to play a song from the album first, and if not found, play a 2019 song. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\n1. Use Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year=2019. If there are results, play one using Music_3_PlayMedia. \n\n2. If no results from the album, then use Music_3_LookupMusic with year=2019 and play one. \n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a track from the album or alternatively any song from 2019.\" So the system needs to handle both possibilities. However, the functions don't have a way to select between the two. So perhaps the user wants to play a song from the album first, and if not found, play a 2019 song. \n\nBut how to structure this in the function calls. Since the user hasn't specified a particular song, maybe the system should first look up the album and then the year. \n\nSo the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year=2019. If there are results, then play one. If not, then use LookupMusic with year=2019 and play one. \n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a track from the album or alternatively any song from 2019.\" So the system needs to handle both possibilities. However, the functions are separate, so the system would need to make two calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from the album, and if not found, play a 2019 song.

However, the functions don't have a way to select between the two.

Then, if no results, use LookupMusic with year=2019. But since the user wants to hear either, the assistant needs to make both calls.

So I should call Weather_1_GetWeather with city='Antioch, CA' and date='2023-10-01'. \n\nI need to make sure the date is in the correct format. The example shows 'YYYY-MM-DD', which matches. The city is in the correct format as 'City, State'. \n\nNo other functions are needed here. The user isn't asking for anything else like renting a car or scheduling a visit.

But wait, the user hasn't specified a particular track yet. They mentioned the album, so maybe LookupMusic can help find songs from that album.\n\nLooking at Music_3_LookupMusic, it allows filtering by artist, album, genre, and year. The user said \"Hillbilly style,\" which is a genre. The album is \"Gotta Be Me.\" The year is 2019. The genre should be 'Hillbilly' if that's one of the options. Let me check the parameters. The genre enum includes 'Hillbilly' as a possible value. So, using LookupMusic with genre='Hillbilly', album='Gotta Be Me', year='2019' would retrieve songs in that style from the album. \n\nOnce they have the list, they can then use Music_3_PlayMedia to play a specific track. But the user hasn't specified which track yet. However, the initial request is to hear a song, so maybe the LookupMusic function will return the tracks, and then PlayMedia can be used. But the user might want to play the first track from that list. \n\nWait, the user's message is a bit ambiguous. They want to hear a song, but they haven't specified a particular track. So maybe the first step is to use LookupMusic to find the songs, then play one. But the functions need to be called in order. However, the user might expect the system to generate the necessary calls. \n\nSo the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters artist='dontcare' (to ignore the artist), album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Hillbilly', year='2019'.

The user is asking for all the actively configured websites. I need to check which function can provide that.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'get_websites' which retrieves a list of websites with settings and metadata. The parameters include a status_filter that can be 'active', 'inactive', or 'maintenance', and a include_metadata boolean. The default for status_filter is 'active', which is exactly what the user wants. Since they want actively configured, the status_filter should be 'active'. The include_metadata is optional, but the user didn't specify whether they need metadata, but since they just said \"all websites,\" maybe including metadata is better. However, the default is False, but the user didn't mention it. Wait, the default is False, but the user might want metadata. But the function's default is False, so maybe it's better to leave it as default unless specified. But the user didn't ask for metadata, so maybe it's safe to not include it. But the function's parameters have include_metadata as a parameter. However, the user's request is just to get all actively configured websites, which the get_websites function can handle with status_filter='active'. So the correct call would be get_websites with status_filter='active'. The other functions like website_configuration_api or ApplicationSettingsApi might not be relevant here. So the answer should be the get_websites function with the status_filter set to 'active'."}

The user wants to add a new service configuration for a service named 'fdsa'. The configuration needs a timeout of 30 seconds, retry count of 5, an endpoint URL of 'https://api.fdsa-service.com', and it requires authentication.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The 'add_service_config' function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are 'service_name' and 'configurations'. The 'configurations' is a dictionary with properties like timeout, retry_count, endpoint, and auth_required.\n\nThe user provided all the necessary details: service_name is 'fdsa', timeout is 30, retry_count is 5, endpoint is 'https://api.fdsa-service.com', and auth_required is True. The default for retry_count is 3, but the user specified 5, so I need to include that. The default for auth_required is True, but the user says it requires authentication, so that's already covered.\n\nSo, I should call add_service_config with service_name='fdsa' and configurations={'timeout':30, 'retry_count':5, 'endpoint':'https://api.fdsa-service.com', 'auth_required':True}. The other parameters like environment and user_id are not needed here since they aren't mentioned in the user's request.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The 'configurations' is a dictionary, and each key is a parameter. The timeout and retry_count are integers, endpoint is a string, and auth_required is a boolean. All required parameters are present. So the function call should be correct."}

The user is asking for the host count on February 15th, 2022. I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'get_hosts_per_day' which requires day, month, and year. The parameters are integers, and the month should be between 1 and 12. February is 2, so that's valid. The day is 15, which is within February's range (1-28 or 29 depending on leap year, but 15 is okay). The year is 2022, which is a leap year but 15 is still valid.\n\nAnother function is 'get_hosts_per_month', but that needs month and year, but the user is asking for a specific day, not the entire month. So 'get_hosts_per_day' is the right choice here.\n\nSo the parameters would be day=15, month=2, year=2022. I need to make sure the function is called with those values. The other parameters like include_subdomains are not needed here since the user didn't mention anything about subdomains. The timeframe is not required either. So the function call should be get_hosts_per_day with those parameters."}

The first one retrieves tokens associated with the user's account, and the second does custom dashboards. The user mentioned their user ID, so the get_api_tokens function seems relevant here.\n\nThe parameters for get_api_tokens require user_id and include_expired. The user didn't specify if they want expired tokens, but the default is False. Since they didn't mention it, maybe we should use the default. So, I should call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=False. \n\nWait, the other function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires user_id and includes expired, but the user didn't mention custom dashboards. The main request is about all tokens, so the first function is better. \n\nSo the function call would be api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=False.

There's 'create_global_application_alert_config' which matches the requirement. The parameters required are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled. The threshold is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. The recipients are an array of emails. The enabled default is True, so maybe it's optional, but the user didn't specify, so include it.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention enabling it, but the default is True. So maybe it's safe to include enabled=True. Let me check the parameters again. The 'enabled' parameter has a default of True, so even if not provided, it's True.

The user is asking for all API tokens now and their user ID is 12345. I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' which retrieves a list of API tokens. The parameters include 'include_expired' which defaults to False, 'page' with a default of 1, and 'page_size' defaulting to 20. Since the user wants all tokens, maybe I should set page_size to 100 if possible. But the maximum is 100, so setting page_size=100 would get all tokens. However, the default is 20, but the user wants all, so specifying page_size=100 would make sense. Also, the user didn't mention expired tokens, so include_expired should stay as default False.\n\nAnother function is 'CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens', but that's for shareable tokens, not all tokens. So the correct one is the APITokenApi's get_api_tokens. The user ID isn't needed here because the function doesn't require it. Wait, the parameters for get_api_tokens don't have a user_id parameter. The required parameters for the APITokenApi.get_api_tokens are none, as per the JSON. So the user ID might not be necessary here. But the user provided their user ID as 12345, but the function doesn't require it. Maybe the function is per user, but the parameters don't include user_id. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to retrieve all tokens for the current user, and the user ID is not needed. So I can call the get_api_tokens function without the user_id parameter.\n\nSo the function call would be api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with page=1, page_size=100, and include_expired=False. That should retrieve all tokens. The user ID is provided but not needed here, so it's okay to omit it."}

The user is asking for a reminder, so set_alarm seems appropriate. The parameters for set_alarm include alarm_time, which can be in various formats. The user provided the date as 2023-12-1 and time as 7:00 AM. The alarm_time parameter accepts 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM AM/PM'. So the date and time should be formatted as '2023-12-01 07:00 AM' to match the required format. The purpose is 'meeting' as specified.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which might be a typo. But the date is 2023-12-1, so the day is the 1st. The time is 7:00 AM. So the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00 AM'. The purpose is 'meeting'. \n\nThe set_alarm function has a default purpose of 'reminder', but the user specified 'meeting', so I should include that. So the function call would be set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00 AM', purpose='meeting'). \n\nI need to make sure the date is correctly formatted. The user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", but the date is 2023-12-1, so the day is the 1st. So the date part is correct. The time is 7:00 AM, which is in the correct format. \n\nNo other functions are needed here. The user didn't mention a countdown, so set_countdown isn't necessary.
