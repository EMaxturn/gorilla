ChaFod: for changing food items. It takes `foodItem`, `newIngredients`, `removeIngredients`, and `specialInstructions`.\n  2. ChaDri.change_drink: for changing drink orders. It takes `drink_id` and `new_preferences`.\n\nWe can break the request into two separate function calls.\n\nFor the food change:\n  - foodItem: \"Caesar salad\"\n  - removeIngredients: \"anchovies\"   (since we are removing anchovies)\n  - We don't have new ingredients or special instructions, so we can omit them or set to default.\n\nFor the drink change:\n  - drink_id: \"123\"\n  - new_preferences: a dictionary that should include:\n        size: \"large\"\n        temperature: \"hot\"\n        sweetness: \"regular\"   (assuming \"regular\" is an acceptable value for sweetness)\n        milk: \"almond milk\"    (or perhaps a key for milk type)\n\nHowever, note that the function `ChaDri.change_drink` expects a dictionary for `new_preferences`. We must structure the dictionary appropriately.\n\nWe are not told the exact keys for the preferences, but from the context, we can assume:\n  - size: string\n  - temperature: string\n  - sweetness: string\n  - milk: string\n\nSo we'll create a dictionary:\n  new_preferences = {\n      \"size\": \"large\",\n      \"temperature\": \"hot\",\n      \"sweetness\": \"regular\",\n      \"milk\": \"almond milk\"\n  }\n\nNow, we can make two function calls.\n\nBut note: the functions are from different modules (or at least have different namespaces). The drink function is `ChaDri.change_drink` and the food function is `ChaFod`.\n\nTherefore, we'll call:\n  1. ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\")\n  2. ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"})\n\nWe must output in the <TOOLCALL> format without any extra text.\n\nHowever, note that the function `ChaFod` has default parameters for `newIngredients` and `specialInstructions`. We are not using them, so we can omit or set to empty string. Since they have default values, we can omit.\n\nSimilarly, for `ChaDri.change_drink`, we are providing all necessary keys in the dictionary.\n\nLet's write the tool calls accordingly."}

Let's break it down:\n\n Step 1: Clone the repository\n   We are to clone the repo from `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git`\n   We don't have a destination specified, so we'll use the default (current directory). Also, we don't need recursive or depth.\n\n Step 2: Analyze the contents of the repo and create/update:\n   2.1: Create/update a Dockerfile based on the analysis.\n   2.2: Create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push to the repo.\n\n However, note that the functions available are:\n   clone_repo\n   create_a_docker_file\n   create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n   analyse_repo_contents\n   push_git_changes_to_github\n\n We must note:\n   - The `clone_repo` function requires `repo_url` and optional `destination`, `recursive`, `depth`.\n   - We don't have a function to \"add all changed files to git\" because the `push_git_changes_to_github` function automatically adds all changes (as per its docstring: \"automatically git add all changes\").\n\n So the plan:\n\n 1. Clone the repository.\n    - We are given the repo URL: `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git`\n    - We'll use the default destination (current directory) and no extra flags.\n\n 2. We need to analyze the repo to determine the language so that we can create the appropriate Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n    - However, note that the `create_a_docker_file` function does not require the language? It just creates a Dockerfile in the specified directory. \n    - But the problem says \"based on the analysis\". We have an `analyse_repo_contents` function that returns the predominant programming language.\n\n    However, the `create_a_docker_file` function does not take the language as an argument. It seems to be a fixed function? \n    Actually, the function `create_a_docker_file` only requires the `directory_name`. So it might be creating a generic Dockerfile? \n\n    But the instructions say \"based on the analysis\". So we must first analyze the repo to know the language? But the function `create_a_docker_file` doesn't use the language. \n\n    Let me reexamine the functions:\n\n    - `analyse_repo_contents`: returns the predominant programming language (but we don't have a function that uses that language to create a Dockerfile?).\n\n    So what should we do? \n\n    We are to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. The functions we have are:\n\n      create_a_docker_file(directory_name)\n      create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name, ... other optional parameters)\n\n    But note: the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has parameters that we might not know? For example, the image_name? \n\n    The steps do not specify the image name, replicas, port, or service type. We are to base on the analysis? \n\n    However, the `analyse_repo_contents` function only returns the language. We don't have a function that returns the port or other details.\n\n    Given the constraints, we must assume:\n\n      - For the Dockerfile: we can create it without knowing the language? But the function `create_a_docker_file` does not take the language. So it must be that the function is smart enough to look at the directory? Or it creates a generic one? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". So we might need to use the analysis to choose the right base image? But our function doesn't do that.\n\n    Since the available functions are fixed, we have to use `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` as they are.\n\n    But note: the `create_a_docker_file` function is described as: \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory\". It doesn't say it uses the language. So we must assume it is generic? \n\n    Alternatively, the `analyse_repo_contents` might not be needed for creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs? The problem says \"based on the analysis\", but if our functions don't require the analysis, then we can skip the analysis? \n\n    However, the problem requires us to do step 2: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we must call the analysis function? \n\n    But the analysis function returns the language. We don't have a function that uses the language. \n\n    Therefore, we have two possibilities:\n\n      a) We call `analyse_repo_contents` to satisfy the step, even though we don't use the result for the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n      b) We don't call it because we don't have a function that uses the result? \n\n    But note: the step says \"analyse the contents ... and create ...\". So we must do the analysis. We can call it and then proceed to create the files without the result? \n\n    However, the problem says \"based on the analysis\", meaning the creation should use the result. But our functions don't take the language. \n\n    Given the available functions, we have to do:\n\n      Step 2.1: create_a_docker_file(directory_name) -> without the language? \n      Step 2.2: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(...) -> without the language?\n\n    So we must assume the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` internally do the analysis? Or they are designed to work without the language? \n\n    Alternatively, the problem might be that we are missing a function? But we are constrained by the given functions.\n\n    Since the problem says we must use the steps, and we have an analysis function, we will call it. But we don't have a function that uses the result? \n\n    Let's read the function `create_a_docker_file`: it only takes `directory_name`. So it must be that the function itself does the analysis? \n\n    Similarly, `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` only requires the directory name and some optional parameters? \n\n    Therefore, we can skip calling `analyse_repo_contents` because the other functions might do it internally? \n\n    But the problem step says: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create ...\". So we are required to do the analysis? \n\n    We have two choices:\n\n      Option 1: We call `analyse_repo_contents` and then ignore the result? But that doesn't make sense.\n\n      Option 2: We interpret that the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` do the analysis internally? \n\n    Given the ambiguity, we will follow the steps as written:\n\n      We must do step 2: \"analyse the contents ... and create ...\". So we will:\n\n        - Call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language? (even though we don't use it in the next functions)\n        - Then call `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` without the language.\n\n    But note: the problem does not say we have to use the result of the analysis. It just says we have to do the analysis and then create. So we are doing the analysis (by calling the function) and then creating.\n\n    Alternatively, if we are not allowed to call `analyse_repo_contents` because we don't use the result, then we skip it? But the step requires it.\n\n    We decide: we will call `analyse_repo_contents` and then proceed to create the files without the result? \n\n    However, the problem says \"based on the analysis\". So we must use the result? But we don't have a function that uses it. \n\n    This is a conflict. Since the available functions don't take the language, we have to assume that the creation functions do the analysis themselves? \n\n    Therefore, we might not need to call `analyse_repo_contents` at all? \n\n    But the step says to do the analysis. So we must do it? \n\n    Let me re-read the step: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". The word \"and\" means we do both, but it doesn't necessarily say the creation uses the analysis? \n\n    We decide: we will do the analysis and then create, even if the creation functions don't use the analysis result? \n\n    However, the problem says \"based on the analysis\", meaning the creation should be based on it. \n\n    Given the constraints of the available functions, we have to assume that the `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` functions are implemented in a way that they do the analysis internally? \n\n    Therefore, we can skip the explicit analysis? \n\n    But the step says we must do the analysis. \n\n    Alternatively, we can call `analyse_repo_contents` and then pass the result to the other functions? But the other functions don't take the language. \n\n    This is a problem with the function set. We must point it out? \n\n    But note the instruction: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n    We are not at a point where we cannot proceed? We can still call the creation functions without the analysis? \n\n    However, the problem requires the analysis. \n\n    Let's try to interpret the step: step 2 is \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". The step doesn't say we must use the result. It just says we must do the analysis. So we can do:\n\n        Step 2: \n          a) analyse_repo_contents(directory_name)   -> we do the analysis\n          b) then create_a_docker_file(directory_name) and create_kubernetes_yaml_file(...)   -> we create the files\n\n    We don't use the result of the analysis, but we did the analysis. \n\n    So we will do:\n\n        Step 1: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n        Step 2: \n            a) analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')   [because when we clone without destination, it creates a directory named 'nodejs-welcome']\n            b) create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n            c) create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')   [with default parameters?]\n\n        Step 3 and 4: Then push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', ...)\n\n    But note: the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has more parameters. We are not provided with:\n\n        deployment_name: we are told to use default if not provided -> so we can omit and it will use default?\n        image_name: default is 'latest' -> but we haven't built any image? This might be a placeholder? We are not building the image, just generating the YAML? \n        replicas: default 1\n        port: default 80\n        service_type: default 'ClusterIP'\n\n    We don't have any information about the port? We can leave it at default 80? \n\n    However, the application in the repo might use a different port? But we don't have a way to know. \n\n    We can assume that the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function will do the analysis to set the port? But the function doesn't say so. \n\n    Given the ambiguity, we will use the default parameters for `create_kubernetes_yaml_file`.\n\n    So:\n\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', \n                                    deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment',   # but note: the function says \"use Defaults if not provided\" -> so we can omit and it will use a default?\n                                    image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest',   # but wait, the function doesn't say how it forms the image name? It just takes an image_name string. \n                                    # We don't have an image built yet? So we leave it as a placeholder? \n                                    # However, the problem doesn't specify. We'll use the default image_name which is 'latest'? But that is just a tag? \n                                    # Actually, the function has a default for image_name: default='latest'. But that is not a full image name.\n\n        This is a problem. The function expects an image_name. We don't have one. We are only generating the YAML. \n\n        The function description: \"Generates a Kubernetes deployment and service YAML file based on the provided directory name.\" and the image_name is an argument. \n\n        We are not told what image name to use. We must point out that the parameter is required? But the function has a default: 'latest'. \n\n        However, 'latest' is not a valid image name (it is a tag). We need at least a repository name? \n\n        Since the problem doesn't specify, we can use the directory name as the image name? But the function doesn't say it does that. \n\n        The function signature: image_name (str, default='latest'). So if we omit, it uses 'latest'. That might be invalid? \n\n        We have to provide a value? But we don't have one. \n\n        Alternatively, we can set image_name to be the directory name? For example, 'nodejs-welcome'. \n\n        But note: the function doesn't say it uses the directory name for the image. \n\n        We decide: we will set the image_name to the directory name (which is 'nodejs-welcome') and use the tag 'latest'? \n\n        However, the function only has one argument for image_name. We can set it to 'nodejs-welcome:latest'. \n\n        But the function's default for image_name is 'latest'. We are allowed to override? \n\n        We'll set: image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest'\n\n        For deployment_name, we can set to 'nodejs-welcome-deployment' or omit? The function says \"use Defaults if not provided\". We don't know what the default is? \n\n        We can omit and let the function choose? \n\n        Similarly, we'll use the defaults for replicas, port, and service_type.\n\n    So:\n\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', \n                                    image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest')\n\n    But note: the function also requires `deployment_name`? Actually, the function has:\n\n        Args:\n            directory_name (str): ...\n            deployment_name (str): ... use Defaults if not provided -> meaning it is optional? But in the function signature, it doesn't have a default? \n\n    Let me check the function definition:\n\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name, deployment_name, image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP')\n\n    Wait, the function definition in the docstring says:\n\n        Args:\n            directory_name (str): ...\n            deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n\n    But in the function signature, `deployment_name` does not have a default? So it is a required argument? \n\n    This is conflicting. The docstring says \"use Defaults if not provided\", meaning it should be optional? But in the function signature we see it as required? \n\n    We must assume the function implementation will use a default if we don't pass? But in the tool call we must pass something? \n\n    Since the docstring says \"use Defaults if not provided\", we can omit? But the tool call requires all required parameters? \n\n    How is the function defined? We don't have the code. We are only given the docstring. \n\n    The docstring for the function:\n\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name, deployment_name, image_name='latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP')\n\n    This shows that `deployment_name` is a required argument because it doesn't have a default? \n\n    But the docstring says for `deployment_name`: \"use Defaults if not provided\". This is confusing.\n\n    We must resolve: the function requires a value for `deployment_name`. We don't have one. We can set it to a default string? For example, the directory name + '-deployment'? \n\n    So we set: deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment'\n\n    Therefore, we call:\n\n        create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', \n                                    deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment',\n                                    image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest')\n\n    The rest will be default.\n\n 3. Step 3: \"add all changed file to git changes\" -> the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does this automatically.\n\n 4. Step 4: commit and push. We'll call `push_git_changes_to_github` with the directory_name and a commit message. We can use the default commit message and branch.\n\n So the sequence of function calls:\n\n  1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n  2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n  3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n  4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment', image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest')\n  5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n But note: the step 2.1 and 2.2 are part of step 2. We are doing the analysis (step 2) and then the creation (step 2.1 and 2.2).\n\n However, the function `push_git_changes_to_github` will add, commit, and push.\n\n We must note: the step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", but the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does that. So we don't need a separate step.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We assume that after cloning, the repository is in a directory named 'nodejs-welcome' (the last part of the repo URL without the .git).\n\n   Therefore, we use directory_name='nodejs-welcome' for the subsequent steps.\n\n   However, what if the clone creates a different directory? The clone function uses the repo name by default? \n\n   The repo URL is `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git` -> the repository name is `nodejs-welcome`. So the directory will be `nodejs-welcome`.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n Let's write the tool calls:\n\n   We are to output a series of function calls in one <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n   Format: <TOOLCALL>[func1(...), func2(...), ...]</TOOLCALL>\n\n   We have 5 function calls? But note: the system will execute them one by one? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n   We are to output all the function calls in one turn? \n\n   Since the problem says \"Do all the following\", we output all the steps in one go.\n\n   But note: the functions depend on each other. We must clone first, then analyze and create, then push.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n      clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n      analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n      create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n      create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment', image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest')\n      push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n   For the push, we use the default commit message and branch.\n\n   We are not forcing the push (force_push=False by default).\n\n   We are not specifying the destination for clone -> so it will be the current directory and the directory will be created as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n   This should work.\n\n However, note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` has other parameters we are omitting? We are setting:\n\n        replicas: default 1\n        port: default 80\n        service_type: default 'ClusterIP'\n\n   So we don't need to specify.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n      <TOOLCALL>[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment', image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]</TOOLCALL>\n\n   But note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also has the parameters replicas, port, service_type. We are not passing them, so they will use the defaults? \n\n   However, the function signature in the docstring shows they have defaults. So we can omit.\n\n   But in the tool call, we are passing by keyword. We are only passing the required ones and the ones we want to set? \n\n   Actually, the function has:\n\n        directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type\n\n   We are setting directory_name, deployment_name, and image_name. The rest are optional and have defaults.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, note: the function `push_git_changes_to_github` has optional parameters: commit_message, branch_name, force_push. We are using the defaults.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But note: the step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". We are not explicitly calling a function for that because the push function does it.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let's output the tool call block."}

We set `search_string` to 'CellResult', `case_sensitive` to False (default) and `include_subdirectories` to True (since we are asked to include subdirectories).\n\n For the second task, we are to get the signatures of two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can use `get_signature` for each method. Note that we need to call it twice: once for 'setCellValue' and once for 'getCellValue'. We assume the class name is 'AbstractCellHandler'. We don't know the module, but the function `get_signature` does not require the module name (the function `get_signature` only requires class_name, method_name, and include_private). However, note that the function `get_signature` is defined to retrieve the signature of a method in a given class. We are not told about the module, so we hope that the class is in the current context. If not, we might have to adjust later.\n\n But note: the user is working on a Java project. The functions we have are designed for a Python context? The function `get_signature` says it retrieves the signature including parameter names and types, which is language-agnostic in concept.

Call `get_signature` for the method 'setCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n 3. Call `get_signature` for the method 'getCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n\n However, note that the function `get_signature` has an argument `include_private` which we can leave as default (False) because we are interested in public methods.\n\n But wait: the user is extending a class and overriding methods. These methods are likely public. So we set `include_private` to False.\n\n Let's write the tool calls accordingly.\n\n Important: We are to output only the tool calls in the <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n We have three function calls. We can put them in one <TOOLCALL> block as a list.\n\n Format:\n <TOOLCALL>\n   [\n     get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True),\n     get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"),\n     get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")\n   ]\n </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function `get_relevant_classes` also has a parameter `case_sensitive` which we can leave as default (False). Similarly, `get_signature` has `include_private` which we leave as default (False).\n\n Alternatively, we can explicitly set the defaults? The problem says: if the function has default parameters and we are okay with the default, we can omit them? But the format requires to pass by name. We are allowed to omit if we are using the default? Actually, the function definitions have defaults. We can omit them if we want the default.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"You MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\". So we must pass by name. But we can skip parameters that have defaults? The problem does not say we must pass every parameter. So we can skip the ones that have defaults and we are using the default.\n\n Therefore, for `get_relevant_classes` we skip `case_sensitive` (default False) and set `include_subdirectories=True`. For `get_signature` we skip `include_private` (default False).\n\n Let's write:\n\n <TOOLCALL>\n [\n   get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True),\n   get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"),\n   get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")\n ]\n </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function name in the function list is `get_signature` (with an 'a')? The function is defined as `get_signature` (without the extra 'a'). So we must write `get_signature`.\n\n Correction: the function is named `get_signature` in the provided list.\n\n So the correct calls are:\n\n   get_signature(...)\n\n We are done."}

Calculate the area of a square with side 5 cm.\n 2. Get the current weather in Queenstown, Singapore.\n\n For the first part, we can use the function `get_area_of_square` with `size=5`.\n However, note that the function `get_area_of_square` does not take a unit. The unit is provided for clarity but the function just returns the area in square units of the input.\n Since the input is 5 cm, the area will be 25 cm\u00b2. But the function doesn't require the unit, so we just pass the number.\n\n For the second part, we can use the function `get_current_weather` with `location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\"`.\n We are not given a unit for temperature, so we can use the default (fahrenheit) or if we want to change, we could specify. But since the user didn't specify, we can use the default.\n\n However, note: the function `get_current_weather` expects a location string in a specific format. We are using \"Queenstown, Singapore\", which should be acceptable.\n\n Therefore, we need to make two function calls.\n\n But note: the system expects one <TOOLCALL> block that can contain multiple function calls.\n\n Let's structure the tool call as:\n <TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note that the function name is `get_area_of_square` (without the 'u' in square) as per the provided function.\n\n Correction: the function is named `get_area_of_square` (correct spelling). So we use that.\n\n Also, note that the `get_current_weather` function has an optional `unit` parameter. Since not specified, we can omit it and it will default to 'fahrenheit'. Alternatively, if we know the user might prefer Celsius, we could set unit='celsius'. But the user did not specify. Since Singapore typically uses Celsius, we might want to use that? However, the problem does not specify. We can either leave it to default or ask? But the instruction says: if the given question lacks parameters, point it out? Actually, the function has a default, so we don't have to. But the user didn't specify, so we can use default.\n\n However, the problem says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. But the `unit` is optional. So we don't have to point it out.\n\n But note: the user might be expecting Celsius? However, the instruction does not allow us to ask for more parameters in the middle. We are to output the function calls. We can use the default and then when we get the result, we can convert? But we are only allowed to call the functions.\n\n Since the user did not specify, we will use the default.\n\n Alternatively, we can use our best judgment. Since Queenstown, Singapore is in a country that uses Celsius, we can set unit='celsius'. But the function call does not require it and we are free to choose. However, the problem does not specify. Let's stick to the default? Or be safe and use Celsius? Actually, the problem says: if the question lacks parameters, point it out. But the user didn't ask for a specific unit, so we are free to choose? Actually, the function has a default, so we can omit.\n\n However, let me re-read the function description: it says the unit is default 'fahrenheit'. So if we don't specify, it will return in Fahrenheit. Since the user is asking about Singapore, which uses Celsius, it might be better to return in Celsius. But the user didn't specify. We are not forced to use one. \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we are to fulfill the purpose, we can choose to use Celsius for Singapore. So we can set unit='celsius'. \n\n Alternatively, we could note that the user did not specify and use the default? But I think for better user experience, we can use Celsius for locations outside the USA. However, the function does not have that logic. We have to pass the unit.\n\n How about we do: \n   get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')\n\n But the function description says the unit is either 'fahrenheit' or 'celsius'. So we can do that.\n\n So let's do:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')]</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note: the function `get_area_of_square` (which is actually `get_area_of_square`) does not take a unit. So we just pass the number.\n\n But wait: the user said \"5 cm\". The function doesn't take unit, so the result will be 25. But we know it's 25 cm\u00b2. However, the function doesn't return the unit. We can only return the number. Then when we present the result, we can add the unit? But the problem doesn't say we have to return the unit. We are just calling the function.\n\n We are only required to call the functions. The system will then use the results and we can present in the next step? But the current instruction is only to output the function calls.\n\n So we'll do two calls.\n\n However, note: the system expects one <TOOLCALL> block. We can put both function calls in one block.\n\n Let's write:\n\n <TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit='celsius')]</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function names must be exactly as provided. The first function is `get_area_of_square` and the second is `get_current_weather`.\n\n Also, the parameters are passed by keyword.\n\n Let me check the function definitions:\n\n   get_area_of_square: size (float) -> we are passing 5 (which is integer but will be converted to float)\n\n   get_current_weather: location (str) and unit (str) -> we are passing a string for location and a string for unit.\n\n So this should be acceptable."}

Since the function has a default for is_unisex, we can omit it and use the default.\n\n But note: the user's request is to both search and book.

But the booking request is independent. We are asked to do both.\n\n 2. Then, we'll call Services_1_BookAppointment to book the appointment.\n\n But note: the booking requires the stylist_name. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' which is the salon name. We assume that's acceptable.\n\n However, what if the search does not return Elegant Styles? The user still wants to book there? The booking function doesn't require that the salon is in the search result. \n So we can book independently.\n\n Therefore, we can make two independent calls.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have all the parameters for both.\n\n However, the search function requires the city in the format 'City, State (abbr)'.

The given functions are named exactly as: \n   Services_1_BookAppointment\n   Services_1_FindProvider   -> Note: it's \"FindProvider\", not \"FindProvider\" in the docstring? Actually the docstring says \"Services_1_FindProvider\", so we use that.\n\n However, in the docstring for Services_1_FindProvider, the function name is written as \"Services_1_FindProvider\".
