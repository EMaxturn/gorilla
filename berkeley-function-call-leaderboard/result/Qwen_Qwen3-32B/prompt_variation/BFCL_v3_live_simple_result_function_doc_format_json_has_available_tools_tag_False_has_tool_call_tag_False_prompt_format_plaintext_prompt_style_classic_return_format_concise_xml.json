The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. \n\nNext, the district_name should be Sankampang, and sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating needs to be 4.5. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't mentioned, so they can be left as default. Also, has_late_check_in defaults to False, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. The function requires the parameters in a specific format. Let me structure the function call with the necessary parameters filled in."}

So I can call the book_flight function with these details."}
