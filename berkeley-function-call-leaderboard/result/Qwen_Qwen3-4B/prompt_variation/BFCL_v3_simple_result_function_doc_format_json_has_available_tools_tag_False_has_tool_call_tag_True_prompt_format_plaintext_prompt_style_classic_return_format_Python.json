Initial velocity is zero, which is the default, so maybe I don't need to specify it. But the user mentioned it explicitly, so maybe include it for clarity. Gravity is 9.81 by default, which is correct for Earth. So the function call should have height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. Wait, but the parameters for the function: initial_velocity is an integer, but gravity is a float. The user didn't mention gravity, so using the default is fine. So the parameters would be height=150, initial_velocity=0. Since gravity is optional and defaults to 9.81, we can omit it.

Since each roll is independent, rolling it twice in a row would be (1/6) multiplied by (1/6), which is 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the available functions, there's a function called probability.dice_roll. Let me check its parameters. The required parameters are desired_number and number_of_rolls.

The status has a default of 'ongoing', so if the user specifies 'ongoing', we can omit it, but since they mentioned \"ongoing lawsuits\", maybe it's better to include it explicitly.\n\nThe company is Google. The start_date is after January 1, 2021. Wait, the function's start_date parameter is in MM-DD-YYY format. The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 2, 2021? Or does the function accept a range? Wait, the function's description says \"start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So maybe the start_date is the beginning of the range. But the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021. So the start_date should be January 2, 2021? Or maybe the function allows a date range, but the parameter is just the start. Hmm, the function's parameters only have start_date and location. So perhaps the user's query is to set start_date as January 1, 2021, but since it's \"after\" that date, maybe the start_date is January 1, 2021, and the end date isn't specified. Wait, but the function doesn't have an end_date parameter. So maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end is not specified. But the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021. So perhaps the start_date should be January 2, 2021? Or maybe the function's start_date is inclusive. The user's instruction says \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the function's parameter is a string in MM-DD-YYY format.

But the user says \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the user might not have specified that.
