The given function is requests.get, which sends a GET request. The parameters required for this function are 'url' and 'params'. The 'url' should be the base path without query parameters, and 'params' is a dictionary of query parameters.\n\nThe user's parameters include fabricName (Network1), nodeId (12), podId (10), interfaceType (Ethernet), and infoType (Speed). The function's parameters for the GET request include these as part of the 'params' dictionary. The enum for interfaceType includes 'ethernet' (lowercase), but the user provided 'Ethernet' with a capital E. I need to make sure to use the correct enum value, so I should convert it to lowercase. Similarly, the infoType has an enum value 'Speed', which the user provided correctly.\n\nThe base URL should be constructed with the IP address and the path. The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example has 'api/api/telemetry'? That might be a typo, but since the function's parameters require the base path, I'll use the provided IP and the given path. So replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67, the url becomes 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nThen, the params dictionary should include all the user's parameters. But the function's parameters for 'params' include fabricName (string), nodeId (integer), podId (integer), interfaceType (from enum, so lowercase 'ethernet'), and infoType (from enum 'Speed'). The user's interfaceType is 'Ethernet', which needs to be converted to 'ethernet' as per the enum. The other parameters are integers, which are correct as 12 and 10. The infoType is 'Speed', which matches the enum.\n\nSo the function call should be requests.get with the url as constructed and the params including all the parameters with the corrected interfaceType. I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted as a dictionary. Also, check if all required parameters are present. The function's required parameters for 'params' are fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType.
