The user wants me to perform several tasks on a Git repository. First, I need to clone the repo from the given URL. The function clone_repo is available for that. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination isn't specified, so I'll use the default, which is the current working directory.\n\nNext, after cloning, I need to analyze the repo contents to determine the primary programming language. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the default destination). The analysis will help in creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\nThen, based on the analysis, I need to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name. But wait, the analysis might tell me if a Dockerfile already exists. However, the user's instruction says to create/update it, so maybe the function handles both cases. I'll call create_a_docker_file with the directory name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory name. The parameters for Kubernetes include deployment name, image name, replicas, port, and service type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use the defaults. The deployment name might default to the directory name, image name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, and service type ClusterIP.\n\nThen, add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can add all changes, but wait, the parameters for that function include directory_name, commit message, branch, and force push. However, the user wants to add changes, commit, and push. The push function automatically adds all changes, so I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name, a commit message (default is 'Update changes'), branch (default main), and force push false.\n\nWait, but the steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is part of the push function's process. So the push function will handle adding, committing, and pushing. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name 'nodejs-welcome', commit message as per the user's step 3, which says \"commit / push to repo\". The commit message in the function has a default, but the user might want a specific one. However, the user didn't specify, so using the default 'Update changes' is acceptable.\n\nSo the sequence of function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination (default).\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and default parameters.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', default commit message, branch, and force push.\n\nBut wait, the analysis step is needed before creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. However, the functions don't have a dependency on the analysis result. The create functions might not use the analysis result, but the user's instruction says to create them based on the analysis. However, the functions provided don't take the analysis result as a parameter. So maybe the analysis is just a step to determine the language, but the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML creation are done regardless. The user might have intended that the Dockerfile is created based on the repo's language, but the function create_a_docker_file doesn't take parameters for that. It just creates a Dockerfile in the specified directory. So perhaps the analysis is just a step to confirm the language, but the actual creation is done without using that info. The functions don't have parameters that link the analysis result to the Dockerfile or YAML creation. Therefore, the analysis might be a separate step, but the subsequent steps proceed regardless.\n\nSo the order is: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push changes. The functions need to be called in that order. However, the user's step 2.1 and 2.2 are to create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. But the functions don't take the analysis result into account. So maybe the analysis is just a step to check the language, but the Dockerfile and YAMLs are created regardless. The user might have intended that the Dockerfile is tailored to the repo's language, but the function doesn't have parameters for that. Therefore, the functions are called as per the user's instructions, even if the analysis isn't directly used in the function parameters.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, clone the repo.\n\nThen, analyze the repo contents.\n\nThen, create Dockerfile in the directory.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs in the directory.\n\nThen, push the changes.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says to add all changed files to git changes, which is part of the push function's process. So the push function will handle adding, committing, and pushing.\n\nSo the correct sequence of function calls is:\n\n1. clone_repo\n2. analyse_repo_contents\n3. create_a_docker_file\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n5. push_git_changes_to_github\n\nBut the user's step 2.1 and 2.2 are part of step 2, which comes after step 1. So the order is correct.\n\nNow, checking parameters for each function:\n\nclone_repo: repo_url is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, destination is default '.'.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_a_docker_file: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', other parameters use defaults.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message default, branch default, force_push default.\n\nSo the function calls should be in that order."}

First, they mentioned a compilation error in their Java project involving the class 'StringNumberHandler' extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. Also, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The function 'get_relevant_classes' is designed for this. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified 'CellResult' as the search term and wants to include subdirectories. So, I'll set 'search_string' to 'CellResult', 'case_sensitive' to false (default), and 'include_subdirectories' to true.\n\nNext, the user needs the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. However, this function requires 'class_name' and 'method_name'. Since there are two methods to check, I'll need to call 'get_signature' twice: once for each method. The parameters for each call would be 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. Also, the 'include_private' parameter defaults to false, which is acceptable here unless the methods are private, but the user is overriding them, so they should be public or protected.\n\nWait, but the user is working in Java. The functions provided are for Python 3 syntax, but the user is using Java. However, the functions might still work if they're analyzing the code structure regardless of the language. The 'get_signature' function's parameters don't mention language, so maybe it's language-agnostic. But the 'get_imports' function does have a language parameter. However, the user's main request is about method signatures and class search, so the other functions might not be affected by the language. The functions might be designed to handle multiple languages, but the descriptions mention Python 3 syntax. Hmm, but the user is using Java, so maybe the functions can still be used as they analyze the code structure. Alternatively, maybe the functions are specific to Python. Wait, the 'get_imports' function has an enum for language, but the others don't. The user's question is about Java, but the functions might not be tailored for Java. However, the user is asking for class names and method signatures, which are common across languages. The functions might be designed to work with any language, but the descriptions mention Python 3 syntax. This could be a problem. However, the user is using Java, but the available functions might not support that. Wait, the 'get_relevant_classes' function's description says it's for the repository, which might be language-agnostic. The 'get_signature' function's description mentions Python 3 syntax, but maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the functions are designed to work with any language. Since the user is using Java, but the functions don't have a language parameter except for 'get_imports', perhaps the other functions can still be used. The user's main need is to find classes related to 'CellResult' and get method signatures. So proceed with the function calls as per the parameters.\n\nSo, first call 'get_relevant_classes' with 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then call 'get_signature' for each method in 'AbstractCellHandler'."}

I'll call that function with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a location in the format 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. Queenstown is a town in Singapore, so the location should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll use the default, which is Fahrenheit. But maybe the user expects Celsius? Well, the default is Fahrenheit, but since Singapore uses Celsius, maybe I should specify that. Wait, the function's parameters have a default of Fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify. Hmm. The function's enum allows 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. Since Singapore uses Celsius, perhaps it's better to set unit='celsius' explicitly.

The user didn't specify a particular type, so maybe I should check both, but the function allows specifying one type at a time. Wait, the parameters require event_type as a single string. So perhaps I need to make two separate calls: one for 'Music' and one for 'Theater'. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types, but according to the parameters, it's a single enum value. So I'll have to call it twice. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly."}

The user wants two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider for searching stylists. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so city is set. They didn't mention unisex preference, so the default 'dontcare' should be used.\n\nThen, for booking, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is required. The parameters here are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' as the salon name, 15:00 as the time, and 2023-05-10 as the date. All required parameters are present.\n\nI need to make two separate function calls. First, call FindProvider with city Sunnyvale, CA and is_unisex default. Then, call BookAppointment with the given details. Check if all parameters are correctly formatted. The date is in YYYY-MM-DD, time in HH:MM, and stylist name is provided. Looks good. No missing parameters here."}
