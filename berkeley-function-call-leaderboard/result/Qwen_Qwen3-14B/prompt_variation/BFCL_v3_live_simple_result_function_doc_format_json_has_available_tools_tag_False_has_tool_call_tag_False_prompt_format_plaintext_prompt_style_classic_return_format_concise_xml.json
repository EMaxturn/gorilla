The parameters given are fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType. The function's parameters include these, so I can map them directly. The interfaceType in the function's enum is 'ethernet', but the user provided 'Ethernet' with a capital E. Need to check if the enum allows that. The enum lists 'ethernet' in lowercase, so maybe the user's input should be converted to lowercase. But the function's parameters might be case-sensitive. Wait, the enum in the function's parameters for interfaceType includes 'ethernet', so the user's 'Ethernet' might need to be adjusted. However, the user might have provided it as is, so maybe the function expects lowercase. Hmm, but the user's parameter is 'Ethernet', so perhaps the API expects that. Wait, the enum in the function's parameters says the interfaceType can be 'gigabitethernet', 'fastethernet', 'ethernet', 'serial'. So the correct value should be 'ethernet' in lowercase. The user wrote 'Ethernet' with a capital E, so I should convert that to 'ethernet' to match the enum. Otherwise, the API might not recognize it.

The district_name should be \"Sankampang\" and sub_district_name \"Ton Pao\". The rating needs to be 4.5. \n\nWait, the parameters have defaults for district and sub-district, but the user specified them, so I should include those. Also, the rating is a float between 0.0 and 5.0, so 4.5 is valid. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't mentioned, so they can be left as default. Has_late_check_in isn't specified, so default to False.\n\nSo the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name=\"Sankampang\", sub_district_name=\"Ton Pao\", rating=4.5. That should filter the professionals meeting those criteria."}
