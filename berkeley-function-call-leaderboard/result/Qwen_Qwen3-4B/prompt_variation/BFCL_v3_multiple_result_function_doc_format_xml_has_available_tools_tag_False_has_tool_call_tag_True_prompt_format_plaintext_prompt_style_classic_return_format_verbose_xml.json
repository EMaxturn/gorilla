The functions available are calculate_displacement and calculate_final_speed. Since the question is about displacement, I should use the calculate_displacement function.\n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. There's no mention of rounding, so I can omit that parameter or set it to a default. The function requires integers for these parameters, and the values given are all integers. So I just need to plug those values into the function. No need to call any other function since the question is straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The user didn't specify any rounding, so the result can be left as is or rounded to zero decimals if needed. But since the function's rounding is optional, I'll exclude it. So the correct function call is calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5."}

The user is asking to find the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The question mentions the object started from rest, so initial speed is zero. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's for when an object starts from rest. \n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest: it requires distance (integer) and time (integer). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional but since it's starting from rest, that's zero. But the function's parameters say initial_speed is an integer, but the user didn't specify it. However, since the object starts from rest, maybe we can omit it or set it to zero. Wait, the function's description says \"starts from rest\", so maybe initial_speed is not needed here. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as optional. But the description says the object starts from rest, so initial_speed is zero. But the function might not require it because it's already accounted for in the description. So maybe we can just provide distance and time. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires distance and time, both integers. The user provided 20 meters (integer) and 4 seconds (integer). So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is not needed here because the function is designed for objects starting from rest. \n\nSo the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4. That should give the final speed."}

Since they're the same gas, the molar quantities are the main factors here. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of the same gas are mixed is based on the law of conservation of energy, where the heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're gases, maybe it's about the weighted average temperature based on moles.\n\nWait, the function provided is called calculate_final_temperature, which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2.
