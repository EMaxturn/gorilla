The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe we can leave it out. So I need to call the calculate_displacement function with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. The rounding parameter isn't mentioned, so maybe it's defaulting to 0 or something. But the function allows it, so perhaps include it as 0 to avoid rounding. Wait, the user didn't mention rounding, so maybe it's better to not include it. But the function's parameters say rounding is optional. So the function call would be with the three required parameters. So the tool call should be kinematics.calculate_displacement with those values."}

The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might show if it's on sale, but the user is asking for the cheapest price. However, the store_price function gives the current price, which could be the cheapest. But maybe there's a sale price that's lower. But the question is about the cheapest selling price, so perhaps the store_price function is the one to use here.\n\nThe parameters required for store_price are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call video_games.store_price with those parameters. The region is optional, but since the user specified United States, I should include it. So the function call would be store_price with those values. The on_sale function might not be necessary here because the user isn't asking about sales status but the price. So the correct function to use is store_price."}

The user is asking to find out the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about finding the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's \"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\" which takes distance, time, and initial speed. The parameters required are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function should calculate the speed using the formula v = u + at, but since it's starting from rest, maybe it's using s = ut + 0.5at\u00b2 to find v. Wait, but the function's description says it calculates speed from rest over a distance, so maybe it's using s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2 to find acceleration first, then v = a*t. But the function's parameters are distance, time, and initial speed. So the function might take distance and time, and initial speed, which is 0 here. \n\nSo the user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, initial_speed=0. The function requires distance and time as integers. The user's input has those values. So the function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nWait, but the parameters for the function are: distance (integer required), time (integer required), and initial_speed (optional). So the user's question specifies that the object started from rest, so initial_speed is 0. Therefore, the function call should include all three parameters. \n\nSo the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, and initial_speed 0. That should give the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, might not be needed here because the question is about finding speed, not acceleration. So the answer is to call calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

The user specified ascending, so order should be 'asc'.\n\nThe elements given are ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack']. The function needs the elements parameter, which is provided. The order is optional but here we'll set it to 'asc'. So the function call should be sort_list with elements and order. Wait, the order parameter is optional, so maybe it's okay to omit it, but the user specified ascending, so including it makes sense. Let me check the function's required parameters. The order is required? No, the required parameter for sort_list is elements. The order is required? No, the required parameters are only elements.

That should sort them in ascending order. The other functions, like filter_list or sum_elements, don't apply here since the task is about sorting, not filtering or summing.

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability.\n\nThe dice_roll_probability function seems relevant here. Let me check its parameters. The required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a sum of 7, so desired_sum is 7. The default for sides_per_die is 6, which is standard for a die. Since the question doesn't specify a different number of sides, I can use the default. The n_rolls parameter is optional and defaults to 1, but since they're asking about two dice, maybe I should set n_rolls to 2? Wait, the function's description says it's for rolling two dice, but the parameters have n_rolls as optional. Wait, the function's parameters: the first param is desired_sum, then n_rolls (optional, default 1), and sides_per_die (required). So if the user is asking for two dice, maybe n_rolls should be 2. But the function's description might be a bit ambiguous. However, the function's parameters allow n_rolls to be set. So to be precise, I should set n_rolls to 2. But the default is 1. So the user is asking for two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. Therefore, the function call would be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Because the sides_per_die is required and defaults to 6, but maybe the user expects that. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6.
