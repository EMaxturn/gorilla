The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned changing from a food item to Caesar salad. The function ChaFod requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I should set newIngredients to exclude anchovies. The default for removeIngredients is an empty string, so maybe that's okay. The specialInstructions might be optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nThen, for the drink order, the user provided drink_id 123 and new_preferences. The function ChaDri.change_drink takes drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences should be a dictionary with key-value pairs. The user mentioned \"regular sweetness and almond milk,\" so the preferences should include those. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. For the food function, the arguments should be foodItem as \"Caesar salad\", newIngredients as \"anchovies\", removeIngredients as \"anchovies\", and specialInstructions as empty. Wait, the user wants without anchovies, so maybe removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". But the default is empty. So maybe the parameters are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are foodItem (str), newIngredients (str, default ''), removeIngredients (str, default ''), specialInstructions (str, default ''). So for the food, the user wants to remove anchovies, so newIngredients would be \"anchovies\", and removeIngredients would be \"anchovies\"? Or maybe the removeIngredients is the ingredients to remove, so if they want to remove anchovies, maybe the newIngredients is the ingredients to add, and removeIngredients is the ones to remove. Wait, the function's description says \"newIngredients (str, default='') a comma-separated list of new ingredients to include in the food item, if any. removeIngredients (str, default='') a comma-separated list of ingredients to remove from the food item, if any.\" So the user wants to add Caesar salad and remove anchovies. So newIngredients would be \"Caesar salad\", and removeIngredients would be \"anchovies\". But the default for removeIngredients is empty. So maybe the parameters are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. \n\nSo for the first function call, ChaFod with foodItem \"Caesar salad\", newIngredients \"anchovies\", removeIngredients \"anchovies\", and specialInstructions empty. Then for the drink, ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id \"123\" and new_preferences as {\"regular sweetness\": \"regular\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"almond milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nWait, the user said \"regular sweetness and almond milk\". So the preferences should be a dictionary with those two keys. So the new_preferences would be {\"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"almond_milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nSo the two function calls are:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<function name=\"ChaFod\"><param name=\"foodItem\">Caesar salad</param><param name=\"newIngredients\">anchovies</param><param name=\"removeIngredients\">anchovies</param><param name=\"specialInstructions\">empty string</param></function>\n<function name=\"ChaDri.change_drink\"><param name=\"drink_id\">123</param><param name=\"new_preferences\">{'sweetness': 'regular', 'almond_milk': 'almond milk'}</param></function>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

The user wants to perform several actions on a GitHub repository. First, they need to clone the repo. The first step is to use the clone_repo function. The parameters required are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. The user provided the URL as git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so I'll set the destination to the current directory since it's the default. The other parameters can be left as default.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes a directory_name. The user hasn't specified the directory, but maybe the default is okay. I'll assume the default is used here.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Since the analysis is done, I need to use that directory. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the directory name yet. Oh, but maybe after cloning, the directory is already set. Or perhaps the directory_name is the same as the cloned directory. I need to check the parameters again. The function's default is to use the current working directory, so maybe the directory_name is the same as the cloned path. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with the directory_name as the cloned path.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user hasn't provided these details, but maybe the default values are acceptable. The default for deployment_name is 'default', image_name is 'latest', etc. So I'll use those defaults.\n\nAfter that, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't specified commit message or branch, so defaults are used. The default commit message is 'Update changes', and branch is 'main'. Force push is default False.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. So after creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML, they need to push the changes. So the push step is necessary. All these steps need to be executed in order.\n\nI need to make sure that each function is called with the correct parameters. Let me structure the function calls accordingly."}

The functions available are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nFor the first part, finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The get_relevant_classes function seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The user mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve the method signatures. The parameters required are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user wants both methods, so I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method.\n\nWait, but the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found. However, the problem is that the user is trying to override methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' which is the superclass of 'StringNumberHandler'. The error message is about 'CellResult', which might be a different class. But the user's question includes that part, so I need to address both parts.\n\nSo, the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search_string as 'CellResult', include_subdirectories true. Then call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with method names 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue', and include_private true for both. Also, check if the get_imports function is needed if there are missing imports, but the user hasn't mentioned that yet.

The user wants two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider which can search for a stylist in a city with an optional unisex filter. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so that's the city. The salon name is 'Elegant Styles', so I need to include that in the search. The is_unisex parameter is a boolean, but the user didn't mention it, so maybe leave it as default or set it to true if they want unisex. Wait, the default is 'dontcare', so maybe just set it to true if they want unisex. But the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it as default. So the first function call would be Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex 'dontcare' or maybe leave it as default. Wait, the default is 'dontcare', so maybe the user didn't specify, so we can use that. So the first function call is Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex 'dontcare'.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the user provided the salon name as 'Elegant Styles' and the time as 15:00 and date as 2023-05-10. The Services_1_BookAppointment function requires stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The stylist_name is 'Elegant Styles', the time is '15:00', and the date is '2023-05-10'. So the second function call would be Services_1_BookAppointment with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the date format in the function's parameters is 'YYYY-MM-DD', which matches the user's input. So both function calls are needed. Let me check if all parameters are correctly provided. For the first function, the city is Sunnyvale, CA, and the is_unisex is 'dontcare' (default). For the second, the stylist name is 'Elegant Styles', time is '15:00', date is '2023-05-10'. Yes, that should work."}
