For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance. Multiplying them together gives (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. But wait, the user specified twice in a row, so that's two successes in a row. The function provided is probability.dice_roll, which calculates exactly this. Let me check the parameters. The function needs desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides. The default for die_sides is 6, which matches the question. So desired_number is 6, number_of_rolls is 2. Since the die is six-sided, I don't need to specify die_sides.

The hotel_booking function requires location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences. The required parameters are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. Preferences are optional but the user specified \"pet friendly\", which is one of the enum options.\n\nThe location should be \"Manhattan, New York\". Room type is \"single\". Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023, which I should format as a string, maybe \"2023-03-10\". Preferences need to include \"pet_friendly\". Since the user didn't mention other preferences, I'll only include that one. The function allows an array, so even though there's only one, it's okay.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. Let me double-check: location, room_type, duration, start_date. Yes, all there. The preferences are optional, but since the user specified pet-friendly, I should include it. So the function call should have those parameters. I'll format the start_date as \"2023-03-10\" to match a standard date format. The preferences array will have \"pet_friendly\"."}

Let me check the available functions. There's a convert_currency function that requires base_currency, target_currency, and amount. The parameters are all required.\n\nThe base_currency here is Japanese Yen, which is JPY. The target_currency is USD. The amount is 20000. So I need to call the convert_currency function with these parameters. I should make sure the currency codes are correct, like using JPY for Japan and USD for the US. The amount is given as 20000, which is an integer, so that's valid. No missing parameters here. I think that's all. Let me structure the function call properly."}
