The user wants to perform several actions on a GitHub repository. First, they need to clone the repo. The first step is to use the clone_repo function. The parameters required are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. The user provided the URL as git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so I'll set the destination to the current working directory by default, which is probably correct.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes a directory_name. The user hasn't specified the directory, but since the clone was done, the destination might be the same as the directory. Wait, the initial clone command uses git@github.com, so maybe the directory is the same as the repo's directory. But the user's instruction says to use the steps provided, so I should assume that the directory is the same as the repo's location. So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with the directory name as the repo's directory.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The user hasn't provided the directory, but since the clone was done, maybe the directory is the same. Wait, the initial clone command's destination is the current working directory. So perhaps the directory_name here is the same as the repo's directory. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the repo's path. Similarly, create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name. The user's steps mention creating Kubernetes YAMLs, so I'll use the same directory as the repo.\n\nAfter that, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't provided these details, but the initial clone was done, so maybe the commit message is \"Update changes\" and the branch is \"main\". The force_push is default false, so I'll use those defaults unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push_git_changes_to_github function does that by default. So I don't need to specify force_push unless needed. So the parameters for push_git_changes_to_github would be directory_name (same as the repo's directory), commit_message (default), branch_name (default), and force_push (default).\n\nPutting it all together, the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination as current working directory.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with the directory name.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, commit message, branch, and force push.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For example, the directory_name for the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs should match the repo's directory. Since the user hasn't specified the exact path, I'll use the default values as per the clone command. So the final function calls should be in the required format."}

The user is trying to fix a compilation error in their Java project. The error is that the method 'getNumericValue()' isn't found in 'CellResult'. They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the get_relevant_classes function seems relevant. The parameters for that function include a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case-sensitive parameter can be set to true if the user wants to match case, but since the error is about 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is needed. The include_subdirectories parameter should be set to true to include subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. The class here is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the methods are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter can be set to true if the user wants to include private methods, but since the error is about the methods, maybe just including them is sufficient. However, the function's default is false, so setting it to true would include private methods.\n\nWait, the user is overriding these methods in their class. So the get_signature function should retrieve the signatures of those methods. The parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private. So for 'setCellValue', the method name is 'setCellValue', and for 'getCellValue', it's 'getCellValue'. Including private would be good to ensure the signatures are correct, even if they are private.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search string 'CellResult', include subdirectories, and get_signature for both methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. Also, check if the parameters are correctly set. The user might need to make sure that the parameters are passed correctly, like the class names and method names. Also, the get_relevant_classes function's parameters are case-sensitive, so if the user's search is case-sensitive, that's important. The user's error is about 'CellResult', so the search string should be that. Including subdirectories is necessary to find all relevant classes, including those in subdirectories.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"get_relevant_classes\">\n    <param name=\"search_string\" value=\"CellResult\" />\n    <param name=\"include_subdirectories\" value=\"true\" />\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"get_signature\">\n    <param name=\"class_name\" value=\"AbstractCellHandler\" />\n    <param name=\"method_name\" value=\"setCellValue\" />\n    <param name=\"include_private\" value=\"true\" />\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"get_signature\">\n    <param name=\"class_name\" value=\"AbstractCellHandler\" />\n    <param name=\"method_name\" value=\"getCellValue\" />\n    <param name=\"include_private\" value=\"true\" />\n</function>\n</functions>\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The include_private is a boolean, so in the function calls, it's set to true. Also, the parameters are strings, so the values are correctly passed. The user might need to check if the methods are indeed private, but since the function includes private, that's covered."}

The user provided 5 cm, so I need to convert that to a float. 5 cm is 5.0 meters if we consider centimeters as units, but the function expects a float. So I'll use 5.0 here.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location parameter. The user specified Queenstown Singapore, so I should pass that as the location. The unit isn't mentioned, so I'll leave it as the default 'fahrenheit' if it's not specified. \n\nWait, but the default unit is 'fahrenheit', so maybe I should check if the user wants a specific unit. However, since the question doesn't mention it, I'll use the default. So the parameters would be location: \"Queenstown, Singapore\" and unit: 'fahrenheit' (or maybe leave it out as default). But the function's default is 'fahrenheit', so including it might be redundant.
