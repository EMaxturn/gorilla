Let me check the available functions. There's a function called Weather_1_GetWeather that retrieves weather info for a city and date. The parameters needed are city and date. The default date is 2019-03-01, but the user provided April 25th, 2023. So I need to replace the default date with the user's input. The city is Foster City. So I should call the function with city='Foster City' and date='2023-04-25'. Let me make sure the date format is correct. The function expects 'YYYY-MM-DD', so 2023-04-25 is correct. No other parameters are needed. Alright, that's all the functions required here."}
