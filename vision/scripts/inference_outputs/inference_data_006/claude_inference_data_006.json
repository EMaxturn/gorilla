To answer this question, I would need to search for information about the Paris 2024 Olympics surfing competition results. I can see this is from Paris 2024, and the person has an American flag on their board, so they're likely representing Team USA.

Since I can't identify the specific person, I'll need to search more generally. Actually, looking more carefully at the image, I can see the surfer is wearing what looks like a competition jersey with the Paris 2024 Olympics branding. They have an American flag on their surfboard, suggesting they're representing Team USA. Without being able to identify the specific individual, I cannot provide their specific score. I should search for USA surfing results from Paris 2024 Olympics to try to get more context, but without knowing which specific athlete this is, I won't be able to give their exact score."

The user is asking about what rank \"she\" placed in this debut Olympic event.
