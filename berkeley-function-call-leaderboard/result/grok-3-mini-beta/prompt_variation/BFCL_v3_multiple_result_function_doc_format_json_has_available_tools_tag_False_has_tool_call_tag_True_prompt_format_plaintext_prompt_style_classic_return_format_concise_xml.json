It's for calculating the future value of an investment.\n\n3. **create_histogram**: This is for creating a histogram, not relevant here.\n\nSo, I need to use **finance.calculate_future_value**.\n\nLet's check the parameters for this function:\n\n- **initial_investment**: Type is integer. User provided $20,000, so I can use 20000.\n\n- **rate_of_return**: Type is float. User provided 8%, which is 8.0 as a float.\n\n- **years**: Type is integer. User provided 5 years.\n\n- **contribution**: This is optional, and the user didn't mention any, so I can omit it or use the default (0).\n\nThe required parameters are: initial_investment, rate_of_return, and years.

I need to confirm if the function expects it as a percentage or decimal.\n\nThe function description says: \"The annual rate of return.\" It doesn't specify, but in finance, rates are often input as decimals (e.g., 0.08 for 8%). However, the user said \"8%\", so I should convert it to 0.08.\n\nLooking back at the function description: \"Calculate the future value of an investment given an initial investment, annual rate of return, and a time frame.\" It doesn't specify the format, but in standard financial formulas, it's a decimal.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume it's a decimal, as that's common in such functions. So, 8% should be 0.08.\n\nIn the parameters, it's just \"float\", and the description doesn't specify. But in the user's query, it's \"8%\", so I need to interpret it.\n\nIn my response, I should use the correct value. I'll convert it to 0.08.\n\nThe function is in Python 3 syntax, and typical future value calculations use decimal rates.\n\nSo, for rate_of_return, I'll use 0.08 as a float.\n\nInitial_investment: 20000 (integer)\n\nYears: 5 (integer)\n\nNo contribution mentioned, so omit it.\n\nThis seems to be all I need for this task.

It's a string for the month of exhibition. The user said \"in the upcoming month\", and the description says \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, I don't need to specify this if it defaults to upcoming.\n\n- **user_ratings**: Optional. It's a string with enum values: 'low', 'average', 'high'. The user said \"top rated\", which likely means high ratings. The default is 'high', so if I don't specify, it will use 'high'.\n\nThe function description: \"Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\". Since the user wants \"top rated\", I should ensure it's set to 'high', but it's already the default.\n\nRequired parameters: Only 'location' and 'art_form' are required.\n\nSo, for this call, I need to provide at least 'location' and 'art_form'.\n\nMy function call should include:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\" (to match the example)\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (since it's a sculpture exhibition)\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will default to upcoming.\n\n- user_ratings: Not specified, so it defaults to 'high', which matches \"top rated\".\n\nThe user said \"modern sculpture\". Is \"modern\" part of the art form? The parameter is just \"art_form\", and the description says e.g., \"sculpture\".
