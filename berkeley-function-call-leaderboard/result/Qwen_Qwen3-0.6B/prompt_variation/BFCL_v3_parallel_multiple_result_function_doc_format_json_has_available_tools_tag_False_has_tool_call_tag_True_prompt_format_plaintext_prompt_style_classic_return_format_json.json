The glucose conversion efficiency is 10%, and the energy per mole is 2800 kJ. So, I need to multiply 5 moles by 2800 kJ/mol and then by 0.1 (the efficiency). The function 'biological.calc_energy' seems right here. The parameters required are 'mols', 'substance', and 'joules_per_mol'. The substance here is glucose, which is C6H12O6.

So I need to call that function with the energy from the first part and 0.1.\n\nThird part: Calculate work done by the machine. The machine moves 2 meters. The function 'physical.calc_work' requires 'energy' and 'distance'. So I need to use that function with the energy from the second step and 2 meters.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned the first part as the total energy, then biomass, then work.

The efficiency is 0.1, which is 10%.\n\nThird function, 'physical.calc_work', requires energy and distance.

The user specified all three, so I'll use that.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly with the right parameters. Let me check again: yes, all required parameters are present. No missing info. So the three function calls should cover all parts of the user's question."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the first part about fish collectables: there's 'get_collectables_in_season' which requires game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'Animal Crossing' and 'Summer' season, so I need to set game_name to 'Animal Crossing', season to 'Summer', and item_type to 'fish'. That should cover that.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The 'game_score.highest' function needs game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia. So parameters would be game='Fortnite', platform='PlayStation', region='Asia'.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The 'lawsuit_details.find' function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided Apple Inc. and 2018, but case_type isn't mentioned. The default is all, so maybe case_type can be omitted. So parameters would be company_name='Apple Inc.', year=2018.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The 'calculate_binomial_probability' function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user specified 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So parameters are number_of_trials=10, number_of_successes=3, probability_of_success=0.7.\n\nI need to check if all parameters are present. For each function, the required parameters are covered. No missing parameters here. So all four function calls should be made."}
