The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user specified \"Caesar salad without anchovies\". The ChaFod function requires foodItem, and optionally newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients mentioned, so that's empty. Special instructions might not be needed here since it's just removing an ingredient. So I'll call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user mentions updating order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences as a dict. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences include \"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\". So new_preferences should be a dictionary with those keys. I'll structure that into the function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For ChaFod, the parameters are strings. For the drink, the new_preferences is a dict. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I think that's all. Both functions are necessary here. No missing parameters, so the calls should work."}

The function call should be in the format of <function name=\"create", "input_token_count": 1004, "output_token_count": 4096, "latency": 101.5449845790863, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the clone_repo function. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents requires the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or the default path. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination defaults to '.', so the repo will be in the current directory. So the directory_name for analysis would be '.' or the actual folder name. But the function expects a path relative to the repo root. Maybe the directory_name is just the folder name. Let me assume it's 'nodejs-welcome' unless specified otherwise. But the user didn't mention a specific directory, so maybe the default is the current directory. Hmm, but the function's argument is directory_name, which should be a valid path. Let me check the function's parameters again. The analyse_repo_contents function's directory_name is a string, so I need to pass the correct path. Since the repo was cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be the name of the cloned folder. Wait, when you clone a repo, it creates a folder with the repo's name unless the destination is specified. So if the URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, the cloned directory would be 'nodejs-welcome' by default. So directory_name should be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter analyzing, step 2.1 says to create/update Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires directory_name. So using the same directory_name from the analysis, which is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen 2.2 is creating Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user didn't specify these, so use defaults. Deployment name might default to the directory name, image name defaults to 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type ClusterIP. So the parameters would be directory_name='nodejs-welcome', and others as defaults.\n\nStep 3 is adding all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The user didn't specify commit message or branch, so use defaults: commit_message 'Update changes', branch_name 'main', force_push False. So directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' again.\n\nFinally, step 4 is commit and push, which is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function.\n\nWait, but the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might refer to git add, but the push function automatically git adds. So maybe after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we need to run git add, but the push function does that. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. So the functions to call in order are clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github. \n\nBut need to make sure the parameters are correct. For the analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. Then create_a_docker_file uses the same directory. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same, and other parameters default. Then push with directory_name, commit message, etc.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url, destination default.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and other defaults.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and defaults.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changes to git\" (git add). However, the push_git_changes_to_github function automatically git adds, so maybe that's covered. So the functions are as above.\n\nNow, check if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is same. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same, others default. For push, directory_name same, others default. So all parameters are present. So the function calls should be in that order."}

The user is facing a compilation error in their Java project. The class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', 'getExcelType', and 'getDefaultExcelFormat'. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'.\n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True. The search_string would be 'CellResult'.\n\nNext, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll have to call it twice, once for each method. The parameters would be class_name='AbstractCellHandler' and method_name for each respective method. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe include_private is False by default, but since the methods are public, it's safe to assume they are not private.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' doesn't have that method, so they need to check if there's a related class that does. But the first part of the query is about finding classes related to 'CellResult', so using get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True should help find possible classes.\n\nSo, the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', case_sensitive=False (default), include_subdirectories=True. Then, call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. The user didn't mention case sensitivity, so default is False. For the get_signature calls, include_private is default False, which is correct unless the methods are private, which they probably aren't since they're being overridden.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature for class 'AbstractCellHandler' method 'setCellValue'.\n3. get_signature for class 'AbstractCellHandler' method 'getCellValue'."}

The user is asking two things: the area of a square with a side length of 5 cm and the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. \n\nFirst, for the area of the square. I remember there's a function called get_area_of_square that takes a size parameter. The size here is 5 cm, so I should use that function with size=5. The unit is given as cm, but the function might just need the numerical value, so I'll input 5 as a float.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore, so the location parameter should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The unit isn't specified, so I'll use the default, which is Fahrenheit. Wait, but Singapore uses Celsius typically. However, the function's default is Fahrenheit, but maybe the user wants Celsius. Wait, the function's unit parameter has a default of 'fahrenheit', but the user didn't specify. Hmm, but the function allows specifying the unit. Since the user didn't mention the unit, maybe I should use the default. However, in Singapore, weather is usually reported in Celsius. But the function's default is Fahrenheit. Should I assume the user wants Fahrenheit or maybe the function can handle Celsius? Wait, the function's unit parameter is a string, and the default is 'fahrenheit'. But the user might expect Celsius. Wait, but the function's documentation says the unit can be specified, but the user hasn't mentioned it. So maybe I should call the function with the default unit, but perhaps the user expects Celsius. Wait, the problem says to use the functions as given. The function's unit parameter has a default of 'fahrenheit', so if the user doesn't specify, we use that. But maybe the user wants Celsius. However, since the user hasn't specified, I should use the default. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept 'celsius' as a valid unit. The documentation doesn't specify, but the parameter is a string. So perhaps the function can take 'celsius' as a valid value. But since the user didn't specify, maybe it's safer to use the default. Wait, the user is asking for the weather in Singapore, which is in Southeast Asia, where Celsius is standard. But the function's default is Fahrenheit. However, the function's parameters allow specifying the unit. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe we should call the function with the default unit, but perhaps the user expects Celsius. Wait, but the function's default is Fahrenheit. So maybe the user would get Fahrenheit, but the actual weather in Singapore is in Celsius. However, the function's parameters might not have a way to specify that. Wait, the function's unit parameter is a string, so maybe the user can pass 'celsius' as the unit. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps we should use the default. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both. But since the user hasn't specified, I should use the default. Wait, but the user might not care about the unit as long as it's correct. Hmm. But the function's default is Fahrenheit, so I'll proceed with that. So the location is \"Queenstown, Singapore\" and unit is 'fahrenheit'.\n\nSo, the two function calls needed are get_area_of_square with size=5 and get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\" and unit='fahrenheit'."}
