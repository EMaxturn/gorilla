First, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time.\n\nThe location given is in Vietnamese, but the example format in the function description uses English. However, the function's param description for loc says it's a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The user's address is \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\". I should probably use that as is, even if it's in Vietnamese, since the function doesn't specify that the address needs to be in English. But maybe the system expects English addresses. Wait, the example given in the function is '123 Main St, Springfield, IL', so maybe the function expects English. However, the user's input is in Vietnamese. Hmm, but the function's parameters don't specify language, so maybe it's okay to use the address as provided. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle Vietnamese addresses. But since the function's example is in English, perhaps the user's address should be converted. Wait, but the user's address is written in Vietnamese, so maybe the function expects the address in the same language. But I'm not sure. However, the function's parameter description says it's a string in the format 'Address, City, State', so maybe the address part can be in Vietnamese. So I'll proceed with the given address.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which matches the parameter. The time is 10 minutes. So the parameters would be loc: \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\", type: \"Plus\", time: 10. All required parameters are present.

The user specified brewery as Creek, style as porter. Taste is slightly bitter, aroma is rich and chocolatey. Color is dark. The other parameters like ABV, IBU, pairings are optional and the user said standard, so maybe we can leave them out or use default values.

The other parameters are optional.\n\nThe user specified \"today\" and \"Mumbai\". The function's description says that if no date is provided, it defaults to the current date. Since the user mentioned \"today\", I don't need to specify the date unless there's a need to confirm. But according to the function's parameters, movie_date has a default of today's date. So, even if I don't include it, it should use today's date. However, the user explicitly said \"today\", so maybe it's better to include it to be explicit, but the function's default is already today. \n\nWait, the system bot is supposed to calculate the current date in India. So the function will automatically use today's date if not provided. Therefore, in this case, the parameters needed are city: \"Mumbai\", and since the date is today, we can omit movie_date. The other parameters like cinema_hall, movie_language, movie_format are not mentioned, so they are optional and can be left out.\n\nSo the function call should be get_movies with city set to \"Mumbai\". The date is already defaulting to today, so no need to include it. The user didn't mention any other filters like language or cinema hall, so those are not needed. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to use get_movies with the city parameter as \"Mumbai\"."}

The parameters required are the URL and params as a dictionary.\n\nThe URL should be constructed with the base path. The example given in the function description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

The user mentioned node ID 12 in pod 10. The params dictionary should include these. The keys might be 'pod' and 'node_id', with values 10 and 12 respectively.

The user didn't specify the exact parameter names, but based on the context, pod and node_id are likely the correct keys.

I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted as a dict. The IP is given, so that's in the URL. The pod and node_id are in the params. I think that's all. Let me check if there are any missing parameters or if the URL is correct.

The url should be the endpoint without query parameters. The example given is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

However, the user hasn't provided other functions, so perhaps the get_service_id is the only step here. \n\nWait, the user's question is to \"help find a housekeeper,\" but the available function is get_service_id. So maybe the function is used to get the service ID for ironing in that area, which would then be used to find the housekeeper. But since the user hasn't provided other functions, maybe the answer is to call get_service_id with the given parameters. \n\nSo, the parameters would be service_id=2 (ironing), province_id=1 (Bangkok), district_name=Chatuchak, and rating=4.5. The function requires service_id as a required parameter, so that's provided. The other parameters are optional but relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is get_service_id with those parameters."}

The user is asking for a housekeeper who provides ironing services in Chonburi Province with a review score of 4.5 stars or more, available on March 12, 2024, between 4 PM and 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function given is get_service_providers. Let me look at its parameters. The service_id is required, and it's an integer. Since the user mentioned ironing services, I need to find the correct service_id. From the description, service_id 2 is ironing. So that's set.\n\nNext, the location is Chonburi Province. The province_id is an integer, with examples like 1 for Bangkok. But the user specified Chonburi, which in the example is province_id 3. So I should use province_id 3 here.\n\nThe user didn't mention a specific district or sub-district, so those parameters can be omitted. The rating is 4.5, which is a float. The start_available_date is 12/03/2024 16:00, but the format required is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. So I need to convert that date to 2024-03-12 16:00:00. The end_available_date is not specified, so maybe leave it as default or set it to the same date but end time? Wait, the user said available on that date from 16:00 to 18:00. So the end_available_date should be 2024-03-12 18:00:00. But the function's end_available_date has a default of no specific end date. However, the user specified a time frame, so I should include both start and end dates.\n\nPutting it all together: service_id is 2, province_id is 3, rating is 4.5, start_available_date is 2024-03-12 16:00:00, end_available_date is 2024-03-12 18:00:00. The other parameters like district_name and sub_district_name are not provided, so they can be left out. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The start_available_date is in the correct format. The rating is a float. The province_id is correct. So the function call should include these parameters."}
