Wait, the parameters say the modification_request is a string, and if there are multiple requests, separate with comma and no space. The user's input has a comma with a space, but the function's example shows comma with no space. Wait, the user wrote \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space after the comma. But the function's description says to separate using comma with no space between. So maybe I should remove the space. But the user's request is verbatim. Hmm, the function's parameters say \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So the correct way is to have \"nopeanuts,extracheese\" without spaces. But the user wrote \"no onions, extra cheese\". Should I adjust it to \"no onions,extra cheese\" without the space after the comma? Or stick to the user's exact words? The function's note says to separate using comma with no space. So maybe the correct parameter is \"no onions,extra cheese\". But the user's input has a space after the comma. Wait, the user's modification is verbatim, so maybe they want exactly \"no onions, extra cheese\". But according to the function's instructions, the comma should have no space. So perhaps the function expects \"no onions,extra cheese\" without the space. But the user's request is to use the modification verbatim. This is a bit conflicting. However, the function's parameter description says to separate with comma and no space. So the correct way is to remove the space. Therefore, the modification_request should be \"no onions,extra cheese\". But the user wrote \"no onions, extra cheese\". Maybe the function can handle it either way, but according to the function's instructions, it's better to follow the format. So I'll format it as \"no onions,extra cheese\".

The function's loc parameter expects a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The user's address includes the street, city, state, and ZIP code. The example in the function's description uses '123 Main St, Springfield, IL', so maybe the ZIP code is optional. But the user provided it, so I should include it as part of the address. So the loc parameter would be \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\".\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which is in the enum ['plus', 'comfort', 'black'].

So the function call should be uber.ride with these parameters. I don't see any missing parameters or issues. The ZIP code might be included even though the example doesn't have it, but the function's description says the format is 'Address, City, State', so including the ZIP might be acceptable here.

The function available is get_movies, which requires the city parameter. The user specified Mumbai as the city, so that's covered. The date is mentioned as \"today,\" so I need to set the movie_date to today's date in India. Since the function's default for movie_date is the current date, but the user is asking for today, I should explicitly set it to today's date. Wait, the function's default is already the current date, so maybe I don't need to include it. But the user might be referring to the same day, so including it would be safe. Let me check the parameters again. The parameters for get_movies include city (required), cinema_hall (optional), movie_date (optional, default current date), movie_language (optional), and movie_format (optional, default 2D). The user didn't mention cinema hall, language, or format, so those can be omitted. So the function call should be get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to today's date. But since the default is current date, maybe just city is enough. However, the user specified \"today,\" so to be precise, I should include the movie_date parameter with today's date. Let me confirm the current date in India. Assuming today is 2023-10-05, but since the actual date isn't provided, the function will handle it. Wait, the system bot is supposed to calculate the current date in India. So the function's default is set to today's date, so maybe the user's \"today\" is already covered. Therefore, the function call would be get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\". But the user might be referring to the same day, so including the movie_date parameter with today's date is better. However, since the default is already today's date, maybe it's redundant. But the user explicitly said \"today,\" so including it would make it clear. So the correct function call is get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to today's date. But how to represent today's date? The function expects a string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. So I need to generate that. Since the system bot is supposed to calculate the current date, I'll use that. Let's say today is 2023-10-05. So the parameters would be city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date=\"2023-10-05\". But since the default is already today's date, maybe the user's question doesn't need the date parameter. However, the user specified \"today,\" so including it is better. Therefore, the function call should include both city and movie_date. But the function's default for movie_date is the current date, so maybe it's optional. But the user is asking for today, so including it ensures that the date is correctly set. Therefore, the correct function call is get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date set to today's date."}
