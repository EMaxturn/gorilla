First, they want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. Looking at the available functions, there's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the foodItem. They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they didn't specify any, maybe we can omit that or set it to default.\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences include size: large, temperature: hot, sweetness_level: regular, milk_type: almond. The special_instructions aren't mentioned, so we can leave that as default. \n\nWait, the function parameters for ChaDri.change_drink have new_preferences as a dict with those properties. So I need to structure the new_preferences accordingly. Also, check if all required parameters are present. The required fields are drink_id and new_preferences. So for the drink function, drink_id is 123, and new_preferences includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, and milk_type. \n\nSo two function calls are needed: one for the food and one for the drink. Let me make sure I didn't miss any parameters. For the food, foodItem is Caesar salad, removeIngredients is anchovies. For the drink, drink_id is 123, new_preferences with the specified attributes. Looks good."}

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or the default directory. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination defaults to '.', so the repo will be in the current directory. So the directory_name for analysis would be the name of the cloned repo. But the user didn't specify a different directory, so maybe the directory_name is the repo's name. Let me assume the directory is named 'nodejs-welcome' after cloning. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce analyzed, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, same directory. So call that with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'. The analysis might determine the language, but the function doesn't take that as a parameter. Wait, the user says to create/update Dockerfile based on the analysis. But the function doesn't have parameters for the language. Maybe the function uses the directory name to generate the Dockerfile, assuming the analysis has already been done. So after analysis, call create_a_docker_file with the directory name.\n\nThen create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. The parameters include deployment_name, image_name, etc., but they have defaults. So call that with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', and use defaults for other parameters unless specified. The user didn't mention specific names, so defaults should be okay.\n\nAfter creating the files, add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, etc. The user says to add all changed files, so the function's git add is automatic. The commit message can be default, and branch 'main' as default. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but the steps mention adding all changed files to Git. The push function automatically adds changes, so that's covered. Then commit and push. So the functions needed are clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and push_git_changes_to_github. \n\nCheck if all parameters are present. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is the repo's directory. Assuming the cloned repo is in a directory named 'nodejs-welcome', that's correct. The other functions use the same directory name. So the function calls should be in order."}

The user is working on a Java project and encountering a compilation error. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They need two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I should check the available functions. The user provided a list of functions. Let me see which ones can help. The 'get_relevant_classes' function can search for classes related to 'CellResult' with include_subdirectories set to true. That should address the first part.\n\nNext, for the method signatures, the 'get_signature' function requires the class name and method name. The user mentioned 'AbstractCellHandler' and the methods 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. So I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. But wait, the parameters for get_signature include 'class_name' and 'method_name', and optionally 'include_private'. Since the user is overriding methods, they might be public, but maybe the methods are private? The default for include_private is false, so unless specified, it'll exclude private methods. But the user wants to ensure they're overriding correctly, so maybe the methods are public. So I'll call get_signature for each method.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. So the methods in AbstractCellHandler should be present. But the error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', which might be a different class. But the user's main request is about finding related classes to 'CellResult' and the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true to find related classes.\n2. Use get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' to get their signatures.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correct. For get_relevant_classes, the required parameter is search_string, which is provided. include_subdirectories is set to true. For get_signature, class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is the respective method. The include_private parameter is optional, default false. So the function calls should be correct.\n\nI should check if any parameters are missing. The user didn't mention the module name for get_class_info, but since they're using Java, maybe that's not relevant. Wait, the functions provided are for Python, but the user is working in Java. Wait, the functions are described as Python 3 syntax, but the user is using Java. Hmm, that might be a problem. Wait, the get_imports function has a language parameter with enum including Java. But the other functions like get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes\u2014do they apply to Java? The descriptions mention Python 3 syntax, but maybe the functions are generic? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, the user is asking about Java, but the functions are for Python. That might be an issue. However, the user might be using these functions in a context where they can handle Java code, or maybe the functions are supposed to work across languages. But the descriptions say Python 3. This could be a problem. However, the user is asking for method signatures in a Java class, so maybe the functions are supposed to work for Java. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a tool that abstracts the language. Since the user is asking for help, I'll proceed with the functions as given, assuming that they can be applied to Java code, even though the descriptions mention Python. Alternatively, maybe the functions are part of a code analysis tool that works with multiple languages. \n\nIn any case, the user's request is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get method signatures for 'AbstractCellHandler'. So the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true.\n\nThen, two calls to get_signature: one for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue, another for getCellValue.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"get_relevant_classes\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"search_string\" value=\"CellResult\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"include_subdirectories\" value=\"true\" type=\"boolean\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n<function name=\"get_signature\">\n<param name=\"param1\" value=\"param1\" type=\"string\"/>\n</function>\n</functions>"}

The unit here is centimeters, but the function doesn't mention units in its parameters, just the numerical value. So I'll call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned \"Queenstown Singapore\", which might be a typo. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but Singapore has a Queenstown area? Or maybe they meant Singapore's Queenstown? Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake and they meant Singapore City. But I should use the exact location given. The location parameter format is 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So Queenstown, Singapore would be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, defaulting to fahrenheit. But since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default. So call get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore' and unit='fahrenheit' or default. Wait, the function's parameters have unit as optional with default 'fahrenheit'. So I can include it or not. But the user might expect Celsius, but since it's not specified, better to use the default. So the function call would be get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore'.\n\nWait, but is Queenstown, Singapore a valid location?
