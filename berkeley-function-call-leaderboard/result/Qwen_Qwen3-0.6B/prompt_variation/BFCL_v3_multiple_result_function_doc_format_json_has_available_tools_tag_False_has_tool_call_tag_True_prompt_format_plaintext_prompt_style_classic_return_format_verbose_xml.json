The user wants to calculate the displacement of a car. The car starts at 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. The motion is along a straight line.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are kinematics.calculate_displacement and kinematics.calculate_final_speed. The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nLooking at the parameters required for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. The rounding parameter is optional, but since the question doesn't specify, maybe we can leave it as default. \n\nWait, the default for rounding is 2 decimals. So I can call the function with those values. Let me make sure there are no missing parameters. All required parameters are present. So the function call should include initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No need for rounding unless specified. \n\nI don't see any issues here. The displacement can be calculated using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Plugging in the numbers: 20*5 + 0.5*10*(5)^2 = 100 + 125 = 225 meters. The function should return that. So the correct function call is to use calculate_displacement with those parameters."}

Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, and time is 4 seconds. The formula for speed when starting from rest is probably the one that relates initial velocity, acceleration, and time. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest.
