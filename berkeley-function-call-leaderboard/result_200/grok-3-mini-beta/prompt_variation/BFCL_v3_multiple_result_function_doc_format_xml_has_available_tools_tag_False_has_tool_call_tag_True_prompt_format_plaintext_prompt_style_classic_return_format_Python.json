Default value will return upcoming events.\" If I don't specify it, it defaults to upcoming events. But the user specified \"upcoming month\", so perhaps I should leave it out to get upcoming ones.\n\n- user_ratings: The user wants \"top rated\", and the default is 'high', which probably means high ratings. So, I can leave it as default or specify 'high'.\n\nTo make it precise:\n\n- Set location to \"New York\"\n\n- Set art_form to \"sculpture\" (since \"modern\" might not be exact, but it's the closest)\n\n- For month, since it's \"upcoming month\", and default is upcoming, I might not need to specify. But if I want to be specific, I don't know the exact month. The query says \"in the upcoming month\", which implies the next month from now. However, the function expects a string like a month name, e.g., \"October\". Since I don't know the current date, I should probably leave it out to use the default.\n\nThe function's description: \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, not specifying month should give upcoming events, which aligns with the user's request.\n\nFor user_ratings, default is 'high', which matches \"top rated\".\n\nSo, I need to call **find_exhibition** with at least location and art_form.\n\nRequired parameters: location and art_form. I have those.\n\nMy response should only be the <TOOLCALL> section with the function call.\n\nFormat: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this: <TOOLCALL>[find_exhibition(location=\"New York\", art_form=\"sculpture\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI think that's sufficient. If needed, the system can follow up based on the response.\n\nOne potential issue: The user said \"modern sculpture\". Is \"sculpture\" enough? Probably, as the function might handle subcategories, or it's the best we have.\n\nAlso, ensure the params are correctly formatted: key=value pairs."}
