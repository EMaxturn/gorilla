The interfaceType enum includes 'ethernet' in lowercase, but the user provided 'Ethernet' with a capital E. Wait, the enum options are gigabitethernet, fastethernet, ethernet, serial. So the correct value should be 'ethernet' in lowercase. But the user specified 'Ethernet', which might be a typo. However, the function's parameters expect the enum values as specified. So I should use 'ethernet' instead of 'Ethernet' to match the enum. But the user might have intended 'Ethernet' as the interface type. Hmm, this could be an issue. However, the function's parameters require the enum values, so I should use 'ethernet' as per the enum. But the user input is 'Ethernet', which might not match. Wait, the user's Parameter_interfaceType is Ethernet, but the enum includes 'ethernet' in lowercase. So maybe the user made a mistake here. But the function requires the exact enum value. So I should use 'ethernet' in the params. However, the user might have intended 'Ethernet' as the value. But according to the tool's definition, the interfaceType must be one of the enum values. So I need to use 'ethernet' as the value for interfaceType. But the user wrote 'Ethernet', which is different. Should I correct it or use as is? The function's parameters are strict about the enum, so using 'Ethernet' might cause an error. Therefore, I should use 'ethernet' as the value. But the user's input is 'Ethernet', so maybe they made a typo. However, the task is to use the parameters as provided. Wait, the user's parameters are given as Parameter_interfaceType: Ethernet. But the function's enum expects 'ethernet'. So perhaps the user's input is incorrect, but the function requires the correct enum value. Therefore, I should use 'ethernet' in the params. But the user might not have intended that. However, the function's parameters are strict, so I have to follow that. So the correct param would be interfaceType='ethernet'.\n\nSimilarly, the infoType is 'Speed' as per the user, and the enum for infoType includes 'Speed', so that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the URL is constructed with the IP, and the params include fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType as 'ethernet', and infoType as 'Speed'.\n\nTherefore, the function call would be requests.get with the URL and the params as specified."}

Wait, the description says the function retrieves the service ID based on service type and location. But the parameters include service_id as a required parameter. That seems a bit confusing.

So I should call the function with both city and date parameters. Let me make sure I have all the required parameters. The city is required, and the date is provided. So the correct function call is Weather_1_GetWeather with city='Foster City' and date='2023-04-25'."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city and an optional date parameter. The city is provided as Rutherford, NJ. The date needs to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user specified April 22nd, 2023, which converts to '2023-04-22'. So I should call the function with city='Rutherford, NJ' and date='2023-04-22'. The default date is 2019-03-01, but since the user provided a specific date, I need to use that. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. No other functions are available, so this should be the correct call."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function. The parameters required are directed_by, genre, and cast, but they're all optional with defaults set to 'dontcare'. Since the user specified the director as James Gray, I should set directed_by='James Gray'. The genre and cast aren't mentioned, so I'll leave them as default. The function should retrieve the list of movies directed by him. I need to make sure I'm not missing any parameters. The user didn't mention genre or cast, so no need to include those. Just call the function with directed_by set to James Gray."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the play_spotify_song function. The parameters required are query, shuffle, and volume. The query needs to be in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName'. So I should structure the query as 'track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar'. The shuffle and volume have defaults, so unless the user specifies otherwise, I can use the defaults. The user didn't mention shuffle or volume, so I'll omit those parameters. Just need to make sure the query is correctly formatted."}
