However, if there are recent related events, it might work, but HNA_WQA.search seems more appropriate for general queries.\n\n- cookbook.search_recipe: Not relevant here.\n\nFor the weather:\n\n- Function: OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\n\n- Parameters: location='Seoul, South Korea', units='metric' (since Celsius is metric)\n\nFor turning on the air conditioner:\n\n- Function: ControlAppliance.execute\n\n- Parameters: command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' (based on the example)\n\nFor information on the Imjin War:\n\n- This is a historical topic, but the user said \"up-to-date information\", which might mean recent discussions or related current events. HNA_WQA.search is for web searches on topics that change, so it's suitable.\n\n- Function: HNA_WQA.search\n\n- Parameters: keyword='Imjin War' (or something similar)\n\nI need to make multiple function calls in one response if necessary. The format is to list them in <TOOLCALL> like: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, I should call all relevant functions now.\n\nResponse format: Only include the <TOOLCALL> section with the functions.\n\nFinal function calls:\n\n1. OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather(location='Seoul, South Korea', units='metric')\n\n2. ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589')\n\n3. HNA_WQA.search(keyword='Imjin War')\n\nFor HNA_WQA.search, I can use defaults for other parameters.\n\nMake sure the command for ControlAppliance is exactly as specified in the enum or description.\n\nThe enum for command is: ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0']\n\nSo, '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' matches perfectly.\n\nPut it all in the <TOOLCALL> tag."}

Other parameters like destination, recursive, depth are optional.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It requires 'directory_name', which would be the path where the repo is cloned.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It requires 'directory_name'.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It also requires 'directory_name'.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 3 and 4. It requires 'directory_name', and it will automatically git add all changes, then commit and push.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, it handles adding, committing, and pushing in one go.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\n1. First, I need to clone the repo. So, call clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\n2. After cloning, I need to analyze the contents. So, call analyse_repo_contents with the directory where it was cloned.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, create/update Dockerfile. The analyse_repo_contents will tell us the predominant language, which can inform the Dockerfile. So, after analysis, call create_a_docker_file.\n\n4. Similarly, create Kubernetes YAML. Call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n5. Finally, add, commit, and push. Call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nThe user said: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following. 2.1 create/update dockerfile based on the analysis. 2.2 kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nIn my tools, analyse_repo_contents just analyzes and determines the language, but it doesn't directly output anything for me to use. However, in this setup, I assume that once I call analyse_repo_contents, the system will handle the output, and I can proceed to call the creation functions.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to output all necessary function calls in sequence for this turn.\n\nFor clone_repo, the default destination is '.', so if I don't specify, it clones to the current directory. I should probably specify it if needed, but the user didn't.\n\nAfter cloning, the directory name would be something like './nodejs-welcome' or whatever the repo name is. For analyse_repo_contents, I need to provide 'directory_name', which is the path relative to the root.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so when cloned, it might create a directory named 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nI need to assume that. So, for subsequent calls, I can use 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory_name.\n\nIn clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it's '.', which means it will clone into the current directory, probably creating a subdirectory with the repo name.\n\nTo be precise, I'll use 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory_name for the other functions.\n\nNow, for create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so I can use defaults.\n\nSimilarly for push_git_changes_to_github, it has defaults for commit_message and branch_name.\n\nSo, in my response, I need to output a <TOOLCALL> with all the necessary functions in sequence.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params), ...]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should list them in the order they need to be executed.\n\nOrder:\n\n1. clone_repo\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents\n\n3. create_a_docker_file\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github\n\nIs that correct? The user said: after analyzing, create dockerfile and k8s yamls, then add/commit/push.\n\nYes.\n\nOne potential issue: Does analyse_repo_contents return something that I need to use for creating the Dockerfile? In this setup, I don't think so; I just call the functions in sequence, and the system handles it.\n\nAlright, let's specify the parameters:\n\n- clone_repo: repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming that's the directory created)\n\n- create_a_docker_file: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome' (and use defaults for others)\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome', and use defaults for commit_message and branch_name.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, the branch_name default is 'main', which is fine.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n[\n\nclone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'),\n\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'),\n\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n]\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(...)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nYes, like that.\n\nI think that's it.

User said 20 degrees, so that's fine.\n\n- Other parameters: image_format (default 'JPEG'), keep_original (default True). No specifics from user, so use defaults.\n\nThe function description says: \"Rotates the image clockwise by a specified degree of angle.\" It doesn't specify which image to rotate. Looking back at the available tools, none of them explicitly take an image as input except for getRecommendationsAction which takes image_data, and removeBackgroundAction which takes image_path.\n\nFor rotateImageAction, the parameters are: degrees, image_format, keep_original. It doesn't list an image input. That's odd. In the description: \"Rotates the image clockwise by a specified degree of angle.\" But in parameters, no image is required. Maybe it's assumed to operate on a default image or something, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLooking closely: In the available tools, for rotateImageAction, the parameters are: {'type': 'dict', 'required': ['degrees'], 'properties': {...}} So, only degrees is required, but how does it know which image to rotate? This might be an oversight, but based on the given info, I have to assume it's handled internally or something. The user didn't provide an image, so perhaps I need to point out that it's missing.\n\nThe human message is: \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally.\" It implies there's an image, but no details are given.\n\nFor flipImageAction, it requires: flip_direction, which is 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.\n\nAgain, no image specified.\n\nThis is a problem. None of the functions except removeBackgroundAction and getRecommendationsAction require an image path or data.\n\nFor flipImageAction and rotateImageAction, they don't have parameters for specifying the image. That means I might not be able to call them without knowing which image.\n\nBut in the task, it says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor these functions, the required parameters are only flip_direction and degrees, respectively. So technically, I can call them as is.\n\nHowever, that doesn't make sense in practice. Perhaps the system assumes an image is already in context.\n\nTo follow the instructions strictly, I should just call the functions with the available parameters.\n\nSo, for rotateImageAction: degrees=20\n\nFor flipImageAction: flip_direction='horizontal'\n\nI can include both in one TOOLCALL.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nYes.\n\nAfter calling these, if there's more needed, I can continue, but I think this fulfills the request.\n\nOne potential issue: The functions might need to be called in sequence, like first rotate, then flip, or vice versa.

The function allows me to specify one event_type per call.\n\nAlso, city: \"Los Angeles\" \u2013 I need to format it as 'Los Angeles, CA' based on the description: \"formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'\".\n\nThe description says: \"The name of the city where the event is happening, formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. For example, 'New York, NY' or 'Paris'. Use short form for the state.\"\n\nFor Los Angeles, it's in California, so 'Los Angeles, CA' is appropriate.\n\nDate: The user said \"on March 10th? this year is 2023\", so that's March 10, 2023. In YYYY-MM-DD format: '2023-03-10'.\n\nI can pass this as the date parameter.\n\nSince the user wants both Music and Theater, I should make two separate calls: one for 'Music' and one for 'Theater'.\n\nThe task says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can output multiple function calls in one response.\n\nIn the tool call format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I can include both in one <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nTherefore, I'll call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once with event_type='Music' and once with event_type='Theater', both with city='Los Angeles, CA' and date='2023-03-10'.\n\nFinally, format the response correctly. Only include the <TOOLCALL> section with the function calls."}
