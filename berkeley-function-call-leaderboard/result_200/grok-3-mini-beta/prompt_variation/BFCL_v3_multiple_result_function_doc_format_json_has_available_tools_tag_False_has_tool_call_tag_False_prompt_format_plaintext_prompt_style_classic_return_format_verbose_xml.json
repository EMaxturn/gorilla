The user specified \"modern sculpture\", but the parameter is just \"art_form\", so I can use \"sculpture\" as it's the closest match.\n     - month: String, for the month of exhibition. Default is upcoming events. The user said \"upcoming month\", which might imply the next month, but since default is upcoming, I might not need to specify if it's not exact.\n     - user_ratings: String with options ['low', 'average', 'high'].

I'll use \"sculpture\" since that's what's given.\n\n- month: The user said \"upcoming month\". The description says: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, if I don't specify, it defaults to upcoming. But the user specified \"upcoming month\", which might mean the next month. However, since it's not exact, and default is upcoming, I might not need to specify it.\n\n- user_ratings: User said \"top rated\", so I should set this to 'high'.\n\nRequired are only location and art_form, so I can call the function with at least those.\n\nI need to format the response as specified: Only return the function calls in the exact XML-like format.\n\nSo, for **find_exhibition**, I'll call it with:\n\n- location: \"New York\" (or \"New York, NY\"? I'll go with \"New York\" as per user input)\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\"\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will default to upcoming.\n\n- user_ratings: \"high\" for top rated.\n\nThe function's parameters don't have a direct way to specify \"modern\", but art_form is \"sculpture\", which might include modern ones.
