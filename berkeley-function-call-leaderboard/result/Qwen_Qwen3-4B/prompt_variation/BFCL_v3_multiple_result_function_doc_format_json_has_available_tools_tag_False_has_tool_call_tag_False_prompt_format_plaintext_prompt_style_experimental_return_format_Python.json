The functions available are calculate_displacement and calculate_final_speed. Since the question is about displacement, I should use the calculate_displacement function. The parameters required are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The user didn't mention rounding, so the default of 2 decimals should be used. Let me check the parameters again: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. All required parameters are provided. So the function call should be kinematics.calculate_displacement with those values."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the 'store_price' function. It requires the game title, platform, and region. The user specified all three: game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I should call store_price with these parameters. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the cheapest price. But the function 'store_price' might return the current price. However, the function description says it fetches the selling price. Maybe there's a sale, but the user wants the cheapest available. But the functions available are store_price, on_sale, and store_currency. \n\nThe 'on_sale' function checks if the game is on sale. If it is, then the price might be lower. But the user wants the cheapest, so maybe first check if it's on sale. But the question is about the selling price, which could include sales. However, the user might be looking for the current price, which could be the sale price if applicable. \n\nBut the functions don't have a 'get all prices' or 'find minimum price' function. So the best approach is to call store_price with the given parameters. That should give the current price, which might already be the cheapest available. Alternatively, if there's a sale, the store_price function might return the discounted price. \n\nSo the correct function to use here is store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'. The other functions aren't needed unless we need to check if it's on sale, but the user is asking for the price, not whether it's on sale. Therefore, the answer is to call store_price with those parameters."}

The available functions are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The question is about finding the final speed when starting from rest, so the calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant. \n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest: it requires distance and time. The user provided both: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the \"started from rest\" part. So I can use this function with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed is 0 by default. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have distance as an integer and time as an integer. The user provided 20 (which is an integer) and 4 (also integer), so that's fine. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, which is correct here.\n\nSo the correct function call should be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed isn't needed since it's zero. That should give the final speed."}

The question is about mixing gases and finding the final temperature, so the calculate_final_temperature function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_final_temperature: it requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided all these values: quantity1 is 2, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3, and temperature2 is 400 K. All required parameters are present. \n\nI don't see any missing information here. The function should be called with these values.

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. The user's query is about dice, so the relevant function is dice_roll_probability.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, and sides_per_die is also required. The user mentioned two dice, so n_rolls is 2. But wait, the default for n_rolls is 1, but the user is rolling two dice. Wait, the parameter n_rolls is the number of dice to roll. So if they're rolling two dice, then n_rolls should be 2. But the function's description says n_rolls is the number of dice to be rolled, default 1. So in this case, the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls=2. However, the parameters required are desired_sum and sides_per_die. The user didn't specify the number of sides on the dice, but standard dice are 6-sided. So I should assume sides_per_die is 6 unless specified otherwise. \n\nSo the function call would be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the parameters for the function: the required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. The n_rolls is optional, with default 1. Wait, the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. But the function's parameters have n_rolls as optional, so I need to include it.

But the function's parameters for n_rolls is optional, so I need to include it. Wait, the function's parameters: the required are desired_sum and sides_per_die. The n_rolls is optional, default 1. So if the user is rolling two dice, then n_rolls should be 2. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. But the user didn't mention the number of sides, so I have to assume standard dice, which are 6 sides. Therefore, the function call is dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's n_rolls is the number of dice, so if you roll two dice, n_rolls is 2.
