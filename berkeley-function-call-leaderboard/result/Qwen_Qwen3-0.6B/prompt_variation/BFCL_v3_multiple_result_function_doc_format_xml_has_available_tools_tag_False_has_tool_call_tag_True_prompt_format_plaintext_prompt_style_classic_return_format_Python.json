The motion is along a straight line.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function can handle this. The available functions are kinematics.calculate_displacement and kinematics.calculate_final_speed. The question is about displacement, so the first function is more appropriate. \n\nThe parameters required for calculate_displacement are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, and time as 5 seconds. The rounding parameter is optional, but since the question doesn't specify, maybe we can omit it. \n\nI should make sure all required parameters are present.

So the function call would be calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. \n\nWait, the parameters are all required except rounding.

The user provided coverage_rate as 400, but didn't specify length and height. Wait, the problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. So maybe the length is 30 and the height is 12? Or maybe the wall is 30 feet in one direction and 12 feet in another. But the function requires both length and height. So perhaps the user expects me to assume that the wall's dimensions are 30 and 12, so length is 30 and height is 12. Then calculate the area as 30*12=360 square feet. Then divide by 400 to get gallons needed. But the function requires coverage_rate, length, and height. The user provided coverage_rate, but didn't specify length and height.
