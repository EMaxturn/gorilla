It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are given here as 20 meters and 4 seconds. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's optional and the function's description says it starts from rest, maybe it's not needed. Let me check the function's parameters again. The 'initial_speed' is required as false, so it's optional. So the call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4). That should compute the final speed using the formula for constant acceleration starting from rest. The formula is probably v = (2d)/t, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, using the equation s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2, but since u=0, s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Then, final velocity v = u + a*t = a*t. Combining these, a = 2s/t\u00b2, so v = 2s/t. So with s=20, t=4, v=2*20/4=10 m/s. So the function should return 10. Therefore, the correct function call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4."}

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability, it requires desired_sum and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a sum of 7, so desired_sum is 7. The number of dice rolled is two, but the parameter n_rolls has a default of 1. Wait, the function's n_rolls is the number of dice, right? So if the user is rolling two dice, I need to set n_rolls=2. But wait, the default is 1, so if not specified, it would be 1. But the user is using two dice, so I must include n_rolls=2. Also, sides_per_die is required. The problem doesn't specify the number of sides, but typically dice have 6 sides. So sides_per_die should be 6. \n\nSo putting it all together: desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. The function call should be dice_roll_probability with those parameters. Let me double-check. The function calculates the probability for a specific sum with n_rolls dice, each with sides_per_die sides. Yes, that's correct. The user didn't mention any different number of sides, so 6 is safe.
