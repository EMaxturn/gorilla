The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers in a specific order. First, they want the HCF of 45 and 60. Then, use that result to find the HCF with 90 and 120. Then, do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, so the first step is to compute HCF(45, 60). Let me note that down. The function provided is math.hcf, which takes two integers. So I can call that function for each pair.\n\nOnce I have the HCF of 45 and 60, let's call that result A. Then I need to compute HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120)? Or wait, the wording says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". Hmm, maybe it's HCF of (A, 90, 120)? But the function only takes two numbers. So perhaps the user means to take the HCF of the previous result with each new pair. Wait, the original question says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\".
