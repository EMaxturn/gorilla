The user wants to modify two things: their food order and their drink order. \n\nFirst, for the food part: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be \"without anchovies\", but the function's specialInstructions parameter is a string, so maybe that's where it goes. Wait, but the function's parameters have newIngredients and removeIngredients as separate. So maybe the specialInstructions is for other notes. But the user specifically said \"without anchovies\", which is a removal. So perhaps removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". The function's parameters have removeIngredients as a string, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the drink order: update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function is ChaDri.change_drink. The parameters required are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences include size: \"large\", temperature: \"hot\", sweetness_level: \"regular\", milk_type: \"almond\". The special_instructions parameter is part of new_preferences as well, but the user didn't mention any, so it can be left as default. So the new_preferences dictionary should have those four keys.\n\nSo, two function calls are needed: one for ChaFod with the food changes, and another for ChaDri.change_drink with the drink details. Let me check the parameters again to make sure. For ChaFod, foodItem is \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". For ChaDri, drink_id is \"123\", and new_preferences includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. All required parameters are present. The user didn't mention any special instructions for the drink, so that's omitted. The functions should be called with these parameters."}

The user is asking for the latest news reports for two different locations: Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland.

There's get_news_report which requires the location, category, and language. The parameters for location are 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, France, since it's a city in a country, that's acceptable. Letterkenny, Ireland would be 'Letterkenny, Ireland' as well. The category needs to be one of the enums, and the user specified technology. The language is English, which is the default, so maybe it's optional, but the user mentioned it explicitly, so I should include it.\n\nSo, I need to call get_news_report twice. First for Paris, France, category Technology, language en. Then for Letterkenny, Ireland, same category and language. Wait, the function's location parameter says if state isn't available, use 'City, Country'. So both locations are valid. The parameters are correct. The category is Technology, which is in the enum. So both function calls should work. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The user said \"again in English\" for the second one, so maybe they want the same as before.

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I'll start by calling the clone_repo function with that URL. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory.\n\nNext, step 2 involves analyzing the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents requires the directory name. Since we cloned the repo into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory_name. After analyzing, the user wants to create or update a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name, which should be the same as the repo's directory. So I'll call that function with the directory_name set to the repo's directory.\n\nThen, creating Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name, which again is the repo's directory. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., aren't specified, so they'll use defaults. I'll set directory_name to the repo's directory here as well.\n\nAfter setting up the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files, the user wants to add all changed files to Git. But the functions available don't include a 'add changes' step. The push_git_changes_to_github function adds changes, but the user might need to run git add first. However, the provided functions don't have a git add command. Wait, the push function says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe that's the step. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be the same as git add. However, the available function is push_git_changes_to_github, which does git add. So maybe that's the step. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. But the functions available don't have a commit function. The push function includes committing? Let me check the function description: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So the push function does git add and commit? Or just push? The description says \"automatically git add all changes\" and then push. So maybe the user's step 3 is to add changes (git add) and then commit and push. But the available functions don't have a commit function. However, the push function might handle adding and committing. So perhaps the user's step 3 is covered by the push function. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is git add, and then commit and push. But the available functions don't have a commit function. However, the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe the user's step 3 is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name and a commit message. The user's step 4 is to commit and push, which the push function handles. So the steps would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name (the repo's directory, which is the current directory)\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name (same as repo's directory)\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name (same as repo's directory)\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name (same as repo's directory), commit_message, branch_name, and force_push as needed.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is git add, but the push function does that. So the push function would handle that. However, the user's step 4 is to commit and push. The push function's description says it will push after adding changes. So the push function would handle both adding and pushing. Therefore, the steps would be:\n\nAfter cloning, analyzing, creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes files, call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name, commit message, branch name, etc.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, then step 4 is to commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a commit function. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes and then push. So the user's step 3 and 4 can be handled by the push function. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is git add, but the push function does that. So the push function is the one that does the adding and pushing. Therefore, the correct function calls are as above."}

They're getting a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They need help finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, the user asked to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters required are 'search_string', which would be 'CellResult', and they want to include subdirectories, so 'include_subdirectories' should be True. The default for that is False, so we need to set it explicitly.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can be used here. But wait, 'get_signature' requires the class name and method name. However, the user is asking about methods in 'AbstractCellHandler', so we need to call 'get_signature' twice: once for 'setCellValue' and once for 'getCellValue', both with 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'include_private' parameter is optional and defaults to False, which is fine unless the methods are private, but the user mentioned overriding them, so they're likely public.\n\nWait, but the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' is part of a different class or package. But the user's main request is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get the method signatures. So first, call get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True. Then, call get_signature for each method in AbstractCellHandler.\n\nBut the user also mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods. So maybe 'AbstractCellHandler' has those methods. The user needs to ensure they're overriding them correctly. So getting the signatures of those methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' is crucial.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True to find classes related to CellResult.\n2. Use get_signature for 'setCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n3. Use get_signature for 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nThat should address both parts of the user's request: finding relevant classes and getting the method signatures."}

The function available is get_area_of_square, which requires the size parameter. The user provided 5 cm, so I'll use that. The unit is cm, but the function's parameter is just a float, so 5.0 should be fine. No need for unit conversion here since the function only needs the numerical value.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is actually in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. Maybe they made a typo? But the function get_current_weather requires a location. The user specified \"Queenstown Singapore\", which might be a mistake. However, the function can take a location string like \"City, Country\". So I'll use \"Queenstown, Singapore\" as the location. The unit isn't specified, so the default is fahrenheit. But since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the default. \n\nSo I need to call both functions. First, get_area_of_square with size 5.
