There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', which is one of the allowed enums (plus, comfort, black). The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So all required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2. The parameters required are loc and type. The loc here needs to be in the format 'City, State', but the user provided a full street address. Also, uber.ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, which matches. However, the loc format doesn't fit because it's a street address, not just city and state. So uber.ride2 might not be the right choice here.\n\nTherefore, the correct function to use is uber.ride. The parameters are loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type as 'plus', and time as 10. All required parameters are met, and the formats are correct."}

But the function's language parameter options are EN, ES, FR, DE. There's no Korean option. The default is EN, but the user might want Korean results. Hmm, but the function doesn't support Korean language. So the search might still return relevant info in English or other languages. I'll proceed with the given parameters, using the keyword in Korean and result_format as text, max_results 10. The language parameter can't be set to Korean, but maybe the search engine can handle the Korean keyword regardless.

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include http_request, which can make a web request. Maybe I can search the web for his birthday. Let me check if there's a function that can do that. The http_request function allows making a GET request to a search engine. Let me use that.\n\nSo, I'll use http_request with method GET and a URL like a search engine query for \"Shishir Patil birthday\". The response might give the date. Once I get the birthday, I can then use send_message to send the congrats. But wait, the user didn't provide his contact info. The send_message function requires a recipient. Hmm, the user might expect me to know his contact details, but I don't have that. Maybe the user wants me to send it through another method, but according to the functions available, send_message is the only way. Since the recipient is required, but not provided, I might need to ask the user for his contact information. However, the user's question doesn't include that. Maybe I should proceed to find the birthday first, then inform the user that I need his contact details to send the message.

However, the user's question is to send a message to Shishir Patil, so the recipient parameter is missing. Therefore, after finding the birthday, I need to inform the user that I can't send the message without his contact details. But the user might have intended to provide that, but didn't. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use another method. Wait, the functions available don't include social media APIs, so the only way is send_message, which requires a recipient. Since the user didn't provide Shishir's contact info, I can't proceed to send the message. Therefore, after finding the birthday, I need to tell the user the birthday and ask for his contact details to send the message.

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for a specific period. They provided details like the account number, name, start and end dates, balances, deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, the account number, the account type is checking, the full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. For the transaction_overview, they need total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned $7,132.76 in deposits and $5,927.40 in withdrawals. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So that fits into the transaction_overview dict.\n\nThen, the user also wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just the totals. So maybe we can't use that function unless we have the list of transactions. However, the user might expect the summary to be generated from the totals. But the function requires individual transactions. Hmm. Since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, maybe we can't call that function. Alternatively, maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve the transactions for the period. The Alltransactions function needs the statement_period and include_pending. The statement period here is October 2019, so '2019-10'. But the user hasn't mentioned pending transactions, so include_pending would default to False. Once we get the transactions from Alltransactions, we could then pass them to transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, maybe we need to first call Alltransactions to get them. However, the user's question is to provide the overview and summary, so maybe the assistant is supposed to generate the summary based on the totals provided. But the transaction_summary.generate function requires individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the assistant can't generate the summary. But the user is asking to include a summary, so maybe the assistant should first retrieve the transactions using Alltransactions and then generate the summary. However, the user's message doesn't include the actual transactions, so maybe the assistant can't proceed. Wait, the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals but not individual transactions. So perhaps the assistant can't generate the transaction summary because it requires individual transactions. Therefore, maybe the assistant should only call BankStatementOverView and note that the transaction summary can't be generated without individual transactions. But the user might expect that the summary is possible with the given totals. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the totals to create a summary, but the function requires individual transactions. This is a bit of a problem. Let me check the parameters again. The transaction_summary.generate function requires an array of transactions, each with amount, vendor, and date. Since the user hasn't provided those, the assistant can't generate that part. So the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and then perhaps inform the user that the transaction summary can't be generated without the individual transactions. But according to the instructions, the assistant should only return function calls. So maybe the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and then Alltransactions to get the transactions for the period, then use those to generate the summary. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't know them. Therefore, the assistant should call Alltransactions for the statement period (October 2019) and then use that data to generate the summary. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only make function calls, not process the data. So the assistant would need to call Alltransactions first, then pass the result to transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't do that. Therefore, the assistant can only call BankStatementOverView and then note that the transaction summary requires individual transactions which aren't provided. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should make the necessary function calls. So perhaps the correct approach is to call BankStatementOverView and then Alltransactions to retrieve the transactions for the period, then use those to generate the summary. However, the user's question is to provide the overview and summary, so the assistant needs to make those calls. Therefore, the assistant should first call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, then call Alltransactions for the statement period (October 2019), and then call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions obtained from Alltransactions, along with the other parameters. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't know them. Therefore, the assistant can only call the functions that can be called with the given information. The Alltransactions function can be called with the statement_period '2019-10' and include_pending=False. Then, once the transactions are retrieved, the summary can be generated. However, in the current step, the assistant can only make the function calls, not execute them. So the assistant should first call BankStatementOverView and then Alltransactions. Then, in a subsequent step, after Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant can call transaction_summary.generate. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make all necessary function calls in the current turn. However, since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't generate the summary yet. Therefore, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions. Then, once the transactions are retrieved, the summary can be generated. But in the current response, the assistant can only make the function calls that are possible with the given information. So the correct function calls are BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions. Then, after Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant can call transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't do that yet. Therefore, the assistant should first call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions. Let me check the parameters again for BankStatementOverView. The required parameters are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, transaction_overview. The user provided bank_name as U.S. Bank, account_number is 1-523-1713-5704, account_type is checking, full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview needs to include total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided total_deposits as $7,132.76, total_withdrawals as $5,927.40, start_date is October 1, 2019 (formatted as '2019-10-01'), end_date is October 31, 2019 (formatted as '2019-10-31'). So that's all the required parameters for BankStatementOverView. Then, Alltransactions requires statement_period as '2019-10' and include_pending is optional, defaulting to False. So the assistant should call Alltransactions with statement_period '2019-10'. Once that's done, the transactions can be passed to transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't do that yet. Therefore, the correct function calls are BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions. The assistant should return those two function calls."}

Its description says it retrieves the list of technologies Adriel was working on, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

The question doesn't mention anything about tools, but the default for include_tools is False, so maybe we don't need to include it. Also, there's no specific date mentioned, so as_of_date can be left as the default (current date). \n\nSo the function call should be get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\". The other parameters can use their defaults. I don't need to specify include_tools or as_of_date unless the user asks for them. \n\nWait, the function's required parameter is employee_id, which the user provided.

The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors.\n\nThe user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which probably corresponds to the 'moderate' price range in the enum. Also, they want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires it in 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and the state is NY, the location should be 'New York, NY'. \n\nThe category isn't specified, so maybe I can leave it out or choose a general one. Wait, the function requires 'category' as a required parameter. The user didn't specify a cuisine type, so maybe I should pick a general category like 'American' or 'Bistro'? But the user didn't mention any specific category, so perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for a general search without a specific category. Wait, no, the 'category' is required. Hmm, the user didn't specify, so maybe I should use a default or general category. Looking at the enum list, 'American' might be a safe choice as a general category. Alternatively, maybe 'Brasserie' or 'Bistro' could work, but the user didn't specify. Since the user is looking for any restaurants with the given criteria, perhaps the category can be left as a common one. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for a wildcard, but the parameters don't mention that. Since 'category' is required, I have to pick one. Let me check the enum list again. The options include 'American', which is a broad category.

The other parameters like has_vegetarian_options are optional and default to False, which is okay since the user didn't mention vegetarian options. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with those parameters."}

The user wants to book a hotel for studio sessions. They mentioned booking on the 15th of July and staying for 5 days. First, I need to figure out which function to use. The available hotel functions are Hotels_4_ReserveHotel and Hotels_4_SearchHotel. Since the user is asking to book, it's likely ReserveHotel. But wait, do they need to search first or directly reserve? The Reserve function requires place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location, and number_of_rooms. The user provided the check-in date as July 15th, stay length 5 days, but didn't specify the location or hotel name. The location is missing. Also, the number of rooms isn't mentioned. The user might assume default values, but the function parameters have defaults. For example, place_name and location in ReserveHotel have defaults of 'dontcare'. But to book, you usually need the specific hotel. Maybe the user expects to search first. However, the user's message is a bit unclear. They might need to search for hotels first using SearchHotel, then reserve. But the user directly says \"book\", so maybe they have a specific hotel in mind. However, since the location isn't provided, I can't proceed. The user didn't mention the city or state for the hotel. Without location, the required parameters for ReserveHotel (location) are missing. So I need to ask for the location. Wait, the user is going to studio sessions\u2014maybe the location is implied by another part of the trip, like the flight destination? But the user hasn't provided flight info yet. So the necessary parameters for the hotel reservation are missing: location and possibly place_name. Therefore, the correct step is to inform the user that the location is required. But according to the instructions, if parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user might expect me to use the functions as per the given info. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location. The user provided check_in_date (July 15th, which I can format as '2023-07-15'), stay_length (5 days), but not place_name or location. So without location, I can't call the function. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the location is missing. But the user might have intended to provide the location in their message. Let me re-read the user's query: \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe there's a typo, like \"2staying\" which could be \"2nd\" or something else. But the main issue is the location. Since the user hasn't provided the location, I can't proceed. So the correct response is to point out that the location parameter is missing. However, the user might have intended to mention the location but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the location is inferred from a previous conversation. But since this is the first turn, there's no prior context. Therefore, the function call can't be made due to missing parameters. So the answer should state that the location is required but not provided."}

The Services_1_FindProvider function seems relevant here because its description mentions searching for a hair stylist in a specified city with an option to filter for unisex salons. \n\nLooking at the parameters for Services_1_FindProvider: it requires a 'city' parameter and has an optional 'is_unisex' boolean parameter with a default of False. The user specified \"unisex\" so I should set is_unisex to True. The city is Pleasanton, but the function's example uses \"New York, NY\". I need to format the city correctly.

The other parameters like artist and genre can be left as default since they're not mentioned. \n\nWait, the function's parameters have defaults: artist and album default to 'dontcare', but since the user specified the album, I should set that. Also, the year is a string in the enum, so '2019' is valid. Let me check the parameters again. The 'album' parameter is a string with default 'dontcare', so setting it to 'High Expectations'. The 'year' parameter has an enum that includes '2019', so set that. The other parameters like genre and artist can stay as default. \n\nSo the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019'. That should retrieve the relevant songs. I don't need to use PlayMedia yet because the user just wants to look up the songs first."}

The event_type can be 'Music' or 'Theater', which matches the user's request. The city is New York, so I'll format that as 'New York, NY'. The date is March 10th, which should be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so '2023-03-10'. The user didn't specify a date preference, but they mentioned March 10th, so I should use that date. The default for date is 'dontcare', but since they have a specific date, I need to set it accordingly.\n\nWait, the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents: the date parameter has a default of 'dontcare', but the user specified March 10th. So I should set date to '2023-03-10'. Let me make sure the function allows that. Yes, the description says if 'dontcare' is specified, any date is considered, but otherwise, it uses the given date. So the parameters would be event_type (either 'Music' or 'Theater'), city 'New York, NY', and date '2023-03-10'. Since the user mentioned both concert (Music) and play (Theater), maybe we should check both types. But the function requires a single event_type. Hmm, maybe the user wants either, so perhaps we need to call the function twice, once for Music and once for Theater. But the user might prefer a single call. Wait, the enum for event_type is ['Music', 'Theater'], so we can't combine them. So perhaps the best approach is to call the function once with event_type as 'Music' and another with 'Theater' to cover both possibilities. However, the user might want both types, so maybe two separate calls. Alternatively, maybe the system allows specifying both, but according to the parameters, event_type is a single string. Therefore, to cover both, we need two function calls. But the user's message says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so they are open to either. However, the function can only handle one event_type at a time. Therefore, I should make two separate calls: one for Music and another for Theater, both in New York, NY on 2023-03-10. But the user might not want to make two separate requests. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept both, but according to the enum, it's either/or. So the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents twice, once with event_type 'Music' and once with 'Theater', same city and date. However, the user might not want to do that. Wait, maybe the user is okay with either, so perhaps the first step is to check for both types. Therefore, the assistant should generate two function calls here. Let me check the instructions again: the user can have multiple function calls in one turn. So the correct response would be two function calls for Events_3_FindEvents with different event_types. That way, both possibilities are covered. So the parameters for each would be event_type: 'Music' and 'Theater', city: 'New York, NY', date: '2023-03-10'. That should retrieve both music concerts and plays on that date."}

Therefore, the correct first step is to call LookupMusic with the available parameters to find the track. Let me check the parameters again. The genre enum includes Country, which is the closest to Hillbilly. The album is specified as \"Gotta Be Me\", and the year is 2019. So the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with artist='dontcare', album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Country', year='2019'. That should retrieve the relevant songs. Once that's done, the next step would be to use the track name from the lookup result to call PlayMedia.

So the date would be 2023-10-27.\n\nSo putting it all together: restaurant_name is Balthazar, location is New York, NY (assuming the state is NY), time is 20:00, date is 2023-10-27, and number_of_seats is 4. All required parameters are present. The function call should include these parameters. Let me check the parameters again to make sure. The required ones are restaurant_name, location, time, date. All are provided. The number_of_seats is optional but needs to be set to 4. So the function call should be correct."}

The available functions are Buses_3_FindBus, Buses_3_BuyBusTicket, Hotels_4_ReserveHotel, and Hotels_4_SearchHotel. Since the user is asking about a bus itinerary, the relevant functions are the Buses ones.\n\nLooking at Buses_3_FindBus, it requires from_city, to_city, departure_date, and optionally num_passengers and category. The user specified Fresno, CA as the departure city and Los Angeles as the destination. The date is March 10, 2023, which should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY, so 03/10/2023. They mentioned traveling alone, so num_passengers is 1. The category isn't specified, so it will default to 'direct'. \n\nThe Buses_3_BuyBusTicket function requires departure_time, which the user hasn't provided yet. Since they're just asking to find the itinerary, not purchase tickets yet, the correct function to use here is Buses_3_FindBus. \n\nSo the parameters needed are from_city: \"Fresno, CA\", to_city: \"Los Angeles, CA\", departure_date: \"03/10/2023\", num_passengers: 1. The category can be omitted as it's optional and defaults to 'direct'. \n\nI should make sure the date is correctly formatted. The user wrote \"10th of march 2023\", which converts to 03/10/2023. The cities are correctly formatted with state abbreviations. The num_passengers is 1 since they're traveling alone. \n\nNo other parameters are provided, so the other functions aren't needed here.

The user specified \"debit card\" as the payment method, $90 as the amount, and \"Alice\" as the receiver.

Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the journey_start_time is 1 day before the date_of_journey? But the date_of_journey is fixed as May 15. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is the previous day, which doesn't make sense.

Let's take the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as the time on that day. The user might have meant the start time is the previous day, but that's not feasible. Maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14, but the date is written as May 15. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the journey to start on May 15, and the start time is the previous day's time, which is not possible. This is a bit confusing. \n\nAssuming the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is the time on that day. The user says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the start time is the previous day, but that would require the date_of_journey to be May 14. However, the user wrote May 15. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is the previous day's time, which is not possible. I'll proceed with the given date and assume that the journey_start_time is the time on May 15. \n\nThe number_of_adults is 4, trip_protection is True, and _class is Business. \n\nSo the function call would be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with parameters _from=Portland, OR, to=Seattle, WA, date_of_journey=2023-05-15, journey_start_time=... but the user didn't specify the exact time. Wait, the user said \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the start time is the previous day's time, but that's conflicting. Since the user didn't provide the exact time, maybe we need to use a default or ask for clarification. However, the function requires journey_start_time. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps we can't proceed. But the user might have intended the start time as the previous day's time, but the date is May 15. That's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14, but wrote May 15. In that case, the date_of_journey would be 2023-05-14. But the user wrote May 15. This is unclear. Since the function requires journey_start_time, and the user didn't provide it, perhaps we can't proceed. However, the user might have intended to leave the start time unspecified, but the function requires it. Therefore, the function call can't be made without the journey_start_time. \n\nWait, but the user might have made a mistake. Let me check the original question again. The user says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". So the journey is on May 15, but starts one day before, which would be May 14. That's conflicting. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14, but wrote May 15. Alternatively, perhaps the journey is on May 15, and the start time is the previous day's time, which is not possible. \n\nIn this case, since the function requires journey_start_time, and the user didn't provide it, the function can't be called. However, the user might have intended to provide the start time as the previous day's time, but the date is May 15. This is a problem. Therefore, the function call can't be made without the journey_start_time. \n\nBut the user might have intended to use the date as May 14, but wrote May 15. Alternatively, maybe the start time is the previous day's time, but the date is still May 15. That's not possible. Therefore, the function call can't be made as the journey_start_time is required and not provided. \n\nWait, but the user might have intended to leave the start time unspecified. However, the function requires it. Therefore, the function can't be called. \n\nBut the user might have made a mistake in the date. Let's assume that the journey is on May 14, and the user wrote May 15 by mistake. Then the date_of_journey would be 2023-05-14, and the journey_start_time is the time on that day. But without the exact time, we can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to book for May 15, and the start time is the previous day's time, but that's not possible. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The user provided _from, to, date_of_journey (May 15, 2023), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (True), and _class (Business). However, journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called without that parameter. \n\nBut the user might have intended to leave the start time unspecified. However, the function requires it. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nWait, but maybe the user intended to use the date as May 15, and the journey_start_time is the previous day's time, but that's not possible. Therefore, the function call can't be made. \n\nSo the answer is that the function can't be called because journey_start_time is missing."}

The user is asking for all their API tokens and provided their user ID as 12345. They're pretty urgent with \"NOW!!!\" so I need to act quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There are two functions related to API tokens: CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. \n\nThe first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user provided their user ID, so that's covered. The second function, get_api_tokens, doesn't require any parameters but has options like include_expired, page, and page_size. \n\nSince the user wants \"ALL\" tokens, I should make sure to retrieve all pages. The default page_size is 20, but maybe they have more than 20 tokens. However, the user didn't specify if they need pagination, but to get all, perhaps we should use the maximum page_size allowed, which is 100. But the function's default is 20. Also, include_expired is a parameter; the user might want expired ones too. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention anything about expired or revoked tokens. The first function's include_revoked defaults to False, and the second's include_expired also defaults to False. But since the user wants all, maybe we should set include_expired to True. However, the user might not have access to expired tokens if they're revoked. \n\nBut the user's main goal is to get all their API tokens. The first function is for shareable API tokens, which might be a subset. The second function is for all API tokens. Since the user provided their user ID, maybe both functions are applicable. But the second function (get_api_tokens) doesn't require the user_id as a parameter. Wait, the parameters for get_api_tokens don't include user_id. That's odd. How does it know whose tokens to retrieve? Maybe the user is authenticated, so the API knows the user's tokens based on their session or token. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the first function is the correct one. \n\nWait, the user's user ID is 12345. The first function requires user_id, so that's necessary. The second function doesn't take user_id as a parameter. So perhaps the second function is for the current authenticated user. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe they want to retrieve tokens for that specific user. However, the second function doesn't have a user_id parameter. Therefore, the correct function to use here is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with the user_id provided. \n\nBut the user might have both shareable and non-shareable tokens. The second function, get_api_tokens, might retrieve all tokens, but since it doesn't take a user_id, perhaps it's for the current user. If the user is the one making the request, then using get_api_tokens without parameters would get their tokens, but since they provided their user ID, maybe they want to confirm it. However, the function that requires the user_id is the first one. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the function descriptions. \n\nCustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens: Retrieve shareable API tokens for the user's account. Requires user_id. \n\napi_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens: Retrieve a list of API tokens associated with the user's account. No parameters required. \n\nSo, the second function might be the right one here because it's for the user's account, and the user provided their user ID, but the function doesn't require it. Maybe the user ID is already known via authentication. However, the user might be using this to specify another user's tokens, but the function doesn't take a user_id parameter. \n\nGiven that the user provided their user ID, but the function that requires it is the first one, which is for shareable tokens. The user might want all tokens, including non-shareable ones. But the second function's description says \"associated with the user's account,\" which could include all tokens. \n\nBut since the user is urgent, perhaps the best approach is to call both functions to cover all possibilities. However, the user might not need shareable tokens specifically. Alternatively, maybe the second function is sufficient. \n\nWait, the user's exact words are \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So they want all tokens for their user ID. The first function requires user_id and retrieves shareable tokens. The second function doesn't require user_id but retrieves API tokens for the user's account. If the user is authenticated, then the second function would get their tokens. However, the user provided their user ID, which is required for the first function. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to call both functions to ensure all tokens are covered. But the second function might not need the user_id. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a context where their user ID is already known, so the second function is sufficient. \n\nBut given that the user explicitly provided their user ID, and the first function requires it, it's safer to call the first function with the provided user_id. However, the second function might return more tokens. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Since the user wants all tokens, and the first function is for shareable ones, maybe the second function is the one that returns all tokens. But without knowing the exact scope of each function, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the function names, get_api_tokens is more general, while get_shareable_api_tokens is a subset. So to get all tokens, the user should use get_api_tokens. But since the user provided their user ID, which is required for the first function, but not for the second, perhaps the second function is the right one. \n\nWait, the user's user ID is 12345. The first function's parameters require user_id, so we must use that. The second function doesn't take user_id, so maybe it's for the current authenticated user. If the user is authenticated as user 12345, then calling get_api_tokens would get their tokens. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe they want to ensure it's for that user. However, the function doesn't take user_id. \n\nIn this case, since the user provided their user ID, and the first function requires it, perhaps the correct function to call is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345. But the user might want all tokens, not just shareable ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused and the correct function is get_api_tokens. \n\nGiven the urgency, perhaps the best approach is to call both functions. But the user might not need shareable tokens. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have made a mistake in providing the user ID, but the correct function is get_api_tokens. \n\nSince the user's main goal is to get all API tokens, and the second function's description says \"Retrieve a list of API tokens associated with the user's account,\" which is more general, and the user is the one making the request (so their user ID is already known), then the correct function is get_api_tokens. However, the user provided their user ID, which is required for the first function. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. To cover all bases, perhaps call both functions. But the user might not need shareable tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi and needs shareable tokens, but the main API tokens are retrieved via the other function. \n\nGiven the function names, I think the user wants all API tokens, so the correct function is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. Since the user provided their user ID, but the function doesn't require it, perhaps it's redundant, but the function will still return their tokens. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to use get_api_tokens with parameters to ensure all tokens are retrieved. Since the user wants all, set include_expired=True and page_size=100 to get as many as possible in one call. However, the default page is 1 and page_size is 20. To get all, maybe multiple pages are needed, but the user didn't specify. Since the user is urgent, perhaps just retrieve the first page with maximum page_size. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens\"><param name=\"include_expired\" type=\"boolean\">True</param><param name=\"page_size\" type=\"integer\">100</param></function>\n\nBut the user provided their user ID, which is 12345. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take user_id as a parameter. So maybe the user is in a context where their user ID is already known, so the function can proceed without it. \n\nAlternatively, if the user needs to specify the user_id, then the first function is required. But since the first function is for shareable tokens, and the user wants all, perhaps both functions should be called. \n\nIn conclusion, to cover all possibilities, call both functions. First, get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345, and then get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and max page_size. \n\nBut the user might not need shareable tokens. However, since they provided the user ID, which is required for the first function, it's better to include it. \n\nSo the final answer is to call both functions."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS).

The enum for that parameter includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. Perfect, that matches the user's query. \n\nThe parameters needed are 'experience_or_education_type' and optionally 'experience_or_education_name'. Since the user specified the education at UNS, I'll set the type to that. The name isn't mentioned, so it can default to 'Not specified' as per the function's default. \n\nI should call 'detail_experience_and_education' with the type set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'.

The user provided the date as 2023-12-1, which is correct. Combining that with 7:00 AM, the time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' or maybe '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. The function's description says it accepts 12-hour format with AM/PM. So using '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' might be better. The purpose is for a meeting, so I'll include that. The default purpose is 'reminder', but the user mentioned a meeting, so specifying 'meeting' makes sense. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The required parameter is alarm_time, and purpose is optional. So the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time='2023-12-01 7:00 AM' and purpose='meeting'. I think that's all."}
