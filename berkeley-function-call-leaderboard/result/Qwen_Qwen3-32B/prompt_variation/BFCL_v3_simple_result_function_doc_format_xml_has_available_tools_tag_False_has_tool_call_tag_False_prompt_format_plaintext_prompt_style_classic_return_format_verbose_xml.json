However, since the parameter is optional, maybe the system has a default. But the user hasn't provided the database name here.

The required parameters are company, start_date, and location. The status is optional with a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe company is clearly 'Google'. The start_date is after January 1, 2021, so I should format that as MM-DD-YYYY, which would be 01-01-2021. The location is California, which is the full state name. Since the status is 'ongoing', which is the default, I don't need to include it unless the user specifies a different status. The user did mention 'ongoing', so maybe include it explicitly? Wait, the default is already ongoing, so maybe it's optional. But the user specified it, so including it would be better to be safe. Wait, the parameters say status is required=false, default is 'ongoing'. So if the user wants ongoing, we can omit it. But since the user explicitly said 'ongoing', maybe include it to be clear. Hmm, but according to the function's parameters, if status isn't provided, it defaults to 'ongoing'. So including it is optional. But to make sure, maybe include it. Wait, the user's query says \"ongoing lawsuits\", so the status is definitely 'ongoing'. So whether to include it or not. The function allows it to be omitted. But maybe including it is better for clarity. Let me check the function's parameters again. The status parameter is required=false, so it's optional. The default is 'ongoing'. So if the user wants the default, we can leave it out. But since the user specified 'ongoing', maybe it's better to include it. But according to the function's design, it's not necessary. So the function call can either include status=\"ongoing\" or omit it. Either way, it's correct. But to be precise, perhaps include it as the user specified. Wait, but the user's instruction says \"filed after January 1, 2021\". The start_date parameter is the start of the date range. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after that date, the start_date should be 01-01-2021. But does the function interpret the start_date as inclusive or exclusive? The description says \"filed in the format of MM-DD-YYYY\", but doesn't specify if it's inclusive. Assuming that the function includes the start_date, so if the user wants after, maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021? Wait, the user says \"after January 1, 2021\", which is after that date. So if the lawsuit was filed on January 1, 2021, it's not included. So the start_date should be the next day. But the user might have intended to include from that date onwards. However, the exact interpretation depends on the function's implementation. Since the function's parameter is called start_date, perhaps it's the earliest date to include. So if the user wants after, maybe the start_date is 01-01-2021, but the function might include that date. But the user's wording is \"after\", which is ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, we have to use the start_date as provided. So I'll use 01-01-2021 as the start_date. \n\nSo the parameters would be company: \"Google\", start_date: \"01-01-2021\", location: \"California\", status: \"ongoing\". But since status is optional and default is ongoing, maybe omit it. But the user explicitly said 'ongoing', so including it is better. Wait, but the default is already ongoing, so including it is redundant. However, the user's query includes it, so perhaps the function call should include it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The status parameter is required=false, so it's optional. The default is 'ongoing'. Therefore, if the user wants the default, we can omit it. But since the user specified 'ongoing', maybe it's better to include it. However, according to the function's definition, it's not required. So the correct approach is to include it only if the user specifies a different status. Since the user is asking for ongoing, which is the default, we can omit it. Therefore, the function call should have company, start_date, location, and not include status. \n\nSo the final function call is lawsuit_search with company=\"Google\", start_date=\"01-01-2021\", location=\"California\"."}
