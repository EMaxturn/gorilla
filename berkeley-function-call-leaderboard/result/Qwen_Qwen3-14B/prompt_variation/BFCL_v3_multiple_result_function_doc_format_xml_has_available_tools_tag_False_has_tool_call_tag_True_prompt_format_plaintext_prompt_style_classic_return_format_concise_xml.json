It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and an optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. There's no mention of rounding, so I can omit that. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_displacement are all integers. The user's inputs are all integers, so that's fine.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are given here as 20 meters and 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest, so initial_speed might be set to 0 by default. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed isn't needed here because it's already accounted for in the function's logic. \n\nAlternatively, if I use the other function, 'calculate_acceleration', but that requires initial and final speed, which we don't have. The user is asking for final speed, so that function might not help directly. \n\nSo the correct function to use is 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance 20 and time 4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's optional and the function is designed for starting from rest, it's probably handled. So the parameters needed are distance and time, both integers. The answer should be the final speed calculated by that function."}

Let me calculate that: 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.\n\nNext, the paint coverage is 400 square feet per gallon. So, the amount of paint needed is the total area divided by the coverage rate.
