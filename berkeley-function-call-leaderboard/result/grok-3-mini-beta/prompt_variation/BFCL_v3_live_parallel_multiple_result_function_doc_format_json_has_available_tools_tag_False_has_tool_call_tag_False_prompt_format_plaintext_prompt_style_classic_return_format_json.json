Since the function can only be called once per invocation, I might need to call it twice: once for each location.\n\nThe response format is an array of function calls, so I can include multiple in one response.\n\nSo, I should prepare two function calls:\n\n1. For Paris, France:\n\n   - location: 'Paris, France'\n\n   - category: Not specified, so use default 'General'\n\n   - language: 'en' (English)\n\n2.

Wait, no, the parameters list it as optional, but to be precise, if I want General, I don't have to specify.\n\n    In the function definition, 'category' has a default, so I can omit it.\n\n    Similarly, 'language' defaults to 'en', but the user specified \"in English\", so I should include it for clarity.\n\n    The prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here, all required are present.\n\n    For safety, I'll include 'language' as 'en'.\n\n  }\n\nSecond call:\n\n- function: \"get_news_report\"\n\n- parameters: {\n\n    \"location\": \"Letterkenny, Ireland\",\n\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n\n    \"language\": \"en\"\n\n  }\n\nI should include 'language' in both for explicitness.\n\nThe enum for language includes 'en', so that's fine.\n\nIs there anything missing? The user said \"also for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news again in English\" \u2013 the \"again\" probably refers to in English, as previously mentioned.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nSo, my response will be:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"get_news_report\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"location\": \"Paris, France\",\n\n      \"language\": \"en\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"get_news_report\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"location\": \"Letterkenny, Ireland\",\n\n      \"category\": \"Technology\",\n\n      \"language\": \"en\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nThat seems correct."}

Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI have the following functions available:\n\n- clone_repo: This can clone the repository. It requires 'repo_url', which is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This analyzes the repo and determines the predominant language. It requires 'directory_name'.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory. It requires 'directory_name'.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This generates Kubernetes YAML files.

Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI should output one or more function calls in this response, and the system will handle the execution and come back if needed.\n\nLet me outline the sequence:\n\n1. First, clone the repo. I need to call 'clone_repo' with the repo_url.\n\n2. After cloning, analyze the repo contents. So, call 'analyse_repo_contents' with the directory name. From the clone_repo function, if I don't specify 'destination', it defaults to '.', but I should specify it for clarity.\n\n   In clone_repo, 'destination' defaults to '.', which is the current working directory. To make it clear, I might want to use a specific name, but the user didn't specify, so I'll assume it's cloned to a default location.\n\n   Then, for analyse_repo_contents, I need 'directory_name', which should be the path where the repo was cloned.\n\n   Problem: The clone_repo function doesn't return the directory name in a way I can use it directly. I have to assume that after cloning, I know the directory.\n\n   In the function parameters, for analyse_repo_contents, 'directory_name' is \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\n   That might be confusing. Looking back: \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\n   For a cloned repo, if I clone to '.', it might be the current directory. To be precise, let's say I clone to a specific directory.\n\n   In clone_repo, I can specify 'destination', so I'll set it to something like 'nodejs-welcome' for clarity.\n\n3. After analysis, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML.\n\n   The analysis function doesn't directly provide output that I can use; it's just a function call. In this setup, I have to assume that after calling analyse_repo_contents, I can proceed to call the creation functions.\n\n   The user says \"based on the analysis\", but in my tools, create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file don't take analysis results as input; they just need the directory_name.\n\n   So, I can call them after analysis.\n\n4. Finally, push the changes.\n\nThe user also says: \"add all changed file to git changes\" and then \"commit / push\".\n\nThe push_git_changes_to_github function says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, it handles the git add part.\n\nI can just call push_git_changes_to_github at the end.\n\nIn one response, I need to output a list of function calls. The format is a JSON array of objects.\n\nI should call them in sequence: first clone, then analyse, then create Dockerfile, then create Kubernetes YAML, then push.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete...\"\n\nSince this is one turn, I should output all necessary calls now.\n\nIn practice, functions might need to be executed sequentially because one depends on the previous.\n\nFor example, I can't analyze before cloning.\n\nI think I just list them in order.\n\nLet me specify the parameters:\n\nFirst: clone_repo\n\n- repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n- destination: Let's say 'nodejs-welcome' for clarity.\n\n- Other parameters default.\n\nSecond: analyse_repo_contents\n\n- directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming that's where it was cloned)\n\nThird: create_a_docker_file\n\n- directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\nFourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n\n- directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- Other parameters can use defaults.\n\nFifth: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n- directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- commit_message: Something like 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML'\n\n- branch_name: Default 'main'\n\nSo, my response should be a JSON array with these five function calls.\n\nThe format is: ```json [ {function calls} ] ```\n\nYes.\n\nOne potential issue: The user said \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis.\" But my function is just 'create_a_docker_file', which generates one based on the directory, presumably using some logic internally.\n\nSame for Kubernetes.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nAlright, let's write it out."}

The user mentioned \"Shishir\", so maybe set recipient to \"Shishir\" or assume it's the human.\n\nThe description says: \"The identifier of the recipient. This could be a username, phone number, or an email address\", and it defaults to 'default@example.com'. Since the user is talking about Shishir, I'll assume that's the recipient.\n\nFor query in recall_memory_search, I need a string. Something like \"Shishir's birthday\" should work.\n\nAfter searching, I might get results, but since I have to send the message regardless, I can just call both functions.\n\nIn one response, I can list multiple functions, and they might be executed in order.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"recall_memory_search\", \"parameters\": {\"query\": \"Shishir's birthday\"}},\n\n  {\"function\": \"send_message\", \"parameters\": {\"message\": \"Happy Birthday!\", \"recipient\": \"Shishir\"}}\n\n]\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIs \"Shishir\" the correct recipient? The human message is from the user, who might be referring to another person. But in context, it seems like Shishir is the one to congratulate, so probably yes.\n\nFor send_message, 'message' is required, and I can set 'urgent' if needed, but default is False.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nOne more thing: The user said \"when Shishir's birthday is\", so my query should be precise, like \"Shishir birthday\" or \"Shishir's birthday date\".\n\nI'll go with \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nAlright, I think that's it."}

The user wants both, so I might need to make two separate calls: one for Music and one for Theater.\n\nThe description says: \"The category of the cultural event.\" It's singular, so probably one at a time.\n\nFor the date: The user specified \"March 1st 2023\", which I need to format as 'YYYY-MM-DD', so '2023-03-01'.\n\nCity: \"San Diego, CA\" \u2013 that matches the required format.\n\nSo, for Events_3_FindEvents, I can call it with:\n\n- event_type: 'Music'\n\n- city: 'San Diego, CA'\n\n- date: '2023-03-01'\n\nAnd then another call for:\n\n- event_type: 'Theater'\n\n- city: 'San Diego, CA'\n\n- date: '2023-03-01'\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can output multiple function calls in one response, as the format allows an array of objects.\n\nSo, I should output two function calls: one for Music and one for Theater.\n\nFinally, the response format must be exactly:\n\n```json\n\n[{\n\n\"function\": \"func_name1\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\"param1\": \"value1\"}\n\n}, ...]\n\n```\n\nNo other text.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n[\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"Events_3_FindEvents\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"event_type\": \"Music\",\n\n\"city\": \"San Diego, CA\",\n\n\"date\": \"2023-03-01\"\n\n}\n\n},\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"Events_3_FindEvents\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"event_type\": \"Theater\",\n\n\"city\": \"San Diego, CA\",\n\n\"date\": \"2023-03-01\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n]\n\nThat seems correct."}
