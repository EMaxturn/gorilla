The function needed here is kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check the parameters required for that function. It needs initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. All the required parameters are provided: 20, 10, 5. Rounding isn't specified, so maybe leave it out. So the function call should be calculate_displacement with those values."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe functions provided are store_currency, on_sale, and store_price. The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price in the US, I need to call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. The on_sale function checks if it's on sale, but the question is about the cheapest price, which might involve checking if it's on sale and then the price. However, the user specifically mentions the selling price, so maybe store_price is sufficient. But wait, if the game is on sale, the store_price might return the discounted price. So I should call store_price with the given parameters. The region is specified as United States, so I'll include that. The parameters are game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'. That should get the current price. I don't think I need the currency function here because the store_price should already account for the region's currency. So the correct function call is video_games.store_price with those parameters."}

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, both integers. The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I should call that function with those parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here.

The user is asking to find the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question says the object started from rest, so initial speed is 0. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which are given as 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional but since it's starting from rest, I can include it as 0. \n\nSo, I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. That should compute the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speeds and time, which I don't have here. So the right choice is calculate_speed_from_rest."}

Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of thermal energy. The formula is (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2), where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters.

There's find_exhibition, which seems relevant here. The parameters required are location, art_form, month, and user_ratings. The user specified \"modern sculpture,\" so art_form should be \"sculpture\" and location is \"New York, NY.\" The month is \"upcoming,\" which the function can handle as the default. User ratings are mentioned as \"top rated,\" so I should set user_ratings to \"high\" as per the function's parameter description.\n\nWait, the function find_exhibition has a parameter for user_ratings with a default of 'high'. So if I include that, it should filter exhibitions with high user ratings. The month is optional, but since the user mentions \"upcoming month,\" maybe the default is set to return upcoming events. But the function's month parameter says the default returns upcoming events. So even if I don't specify the month, it should work. However, the user specifically says \"upcoming month,\" so maybe it's better to include month as \"upcoming\" to be explicit.\n\nSo the function call would be find_exhibition with location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", month=\"upcoming\", and user_ratings=\"high\". That should get the top-rated modern sculpture exhibitions in New York for the upcoming month.\n\nI don't think any other functions are needed here.
