But the user didn't specify a particular date, just \"after January 1, 2021\". However, the function's start_date is a string, so maybe the user wants the start date to be the earliest possible, but the function might handle it as a range.

But since the function only has start_date, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and end date, but the user didn't provide end_date. However, the user's instruction says \"after January 1, 2021\", so perhaps the start_date is set to that date, and the end_date is not provided. But the function's parameters don't have an end_date. This is a bit confusing. But according to the function's parameters, the user can only provide start_date. So maybe the function is designed to accept a start date and end date, but the user only provided start_date. However, the user's query is to find lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, so the start_date should be set to that date. The end_date is not specified, so maybe the function will handle it as a range from start_date to some future date. But since the function's parameters don't include end_date, perhaps the user is expected to provide start_date and end_date. But the user only provided start_date. Hmm. Maybe the function is designed to accept a start_date and end_date, but the user's input is incomplete. However, the user's query says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date is set to that date. The end_date is not specified, so maybe the function will handle it as a range from start_date to a default end date. But since the function's parameters don't include end_date, perhaps the user is expected to provide both. But the user only provided start_date. This is a problem. However, the user's instruction says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date is set to that date. The end_date is not provided, so maybe the function will use a default end date. But since the function's parameters don't include end_date, perhaps the user is expected to provide start_date and end_date. But the user only provided start_date. So maybe the function is designed to accept start_date and end_date, but the user's input is incomplete.

The end_date is not specified, so perhaps the function will use a default end date. But since the function's parameters don't include end_date, maybe the user is expected to provide it.

The user's query is to search for ongoing lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021 in California. So the parameters are correctly set.
