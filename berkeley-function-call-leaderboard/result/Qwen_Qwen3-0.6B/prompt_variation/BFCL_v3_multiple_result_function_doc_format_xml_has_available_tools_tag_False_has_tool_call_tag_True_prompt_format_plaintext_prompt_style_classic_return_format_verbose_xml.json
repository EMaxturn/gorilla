The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems appropriate here. \n\nLooking at the parameters required for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, and time as 5 seconds. The rounding parameter is optional, but since the question doesn't specify, maybe we can omit it. \n\nI should make sure all required parameters are present. The user didn't mention rounding, so maybe leave it out.

Wait, but the problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. Hmm, maybe the height is 12 feet? Or is the wall's dimensions 30x12? The problem doesn't specify the height, but maybe the height is the same as the length or width? Wait, the user just says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. So maybe the area is 30 * 12 = 360 square feet. But the problem doesn't mention the height. Wait, maybe the height is 12 feet? Or perhaps the height is the same as the length? Wait, the user might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The question says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. So maybe the height is 12 feet, making the area 30*12=360. But if the height isn't specified, maybe the user expects that the height is 12 feet. Alternatively, maybe the height is the same as the length, so 30 feet. But without knowing the height, how can we calculate the area? Wait, maybe the height is 12 feet, so the area is 30*12=360. But the problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. So perhaps the height is 12 feet. Therefore, the area is 30*12=360 square feet.\n\nNow, the paint coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. So the total gallons needed would be area divided by coverage rate. Let me calculate that. 360 / 400 = 0.9 gallons. But wait, maybe the user expects to round up? Because you can't have a fraction of a gallon. So 0.9 gallons would be 1 gallon if rounded up. But the problem says \"total quantity of paint needed\", so maybe they just want the exact value. But the function parameters require integer values. So the parameters would be coverage_rate=400, length=30, height=12. Then calculate the area as 30*12=360. Then divide by 400 to get the gallons. So the function calculate_paint_needed would be called with those parameters. Let me check the parameters again. The function calculate_paint_needed requires coverage_rate, length, and height. The user provided the wall dimensions as 30x12, so maybe the height is 12. So the parameters would be coverage_rate=400, length=30, height=12.
