The second one has loc, type, and time (optional). The user provided all three parameters: location, type as 'Plus', and time 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the first function's loc parameter requires 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided exactly. The second function's loc is 'City, State', but the user's address includes the street.

They specified that the results should be in text format and limited to a maximum of 10. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, HNA_WQA.search is for retrieving up-to-date info via web search, which fits for current events or topics that change frequently. The parameters include keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user mentioned the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', so that's the keyword. They want text format, so result_format should be 'text'. Also, max_results is 10. The language isn't specified, but since the query is in Korean, maybe default to Korean. \n\nAnother function is HNA_NEWS.search, but that's for recent events and news. The user is asking for information about a historical event, which might be more general rather than recent news. So HNA_WQA.search is more appropriate here. \n\nSo the correct function call should be HNA_WQA.search with keyword='\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format='text', and max_results=10. The language parameter is optional, but since the user's query is in Korean, maybe include language='ko' to ensure the results are in Korean. But the function's parameters don't require it, so maybe it's optional. However, the user didn't specify, so perhaps leave it out. Wait, the function's parameters have language as optional. The user's instruction is in Korean, so maybe the results should be in Korean. But the function might default to English. Hmm, but the user is asking for information in Korean, so maybe set language='ko'. But the function's description says the language preference is optional. \n\nAlternatively, since the user is using Korean, maybe the results are expected in Korean. So I should include language='ko'. But the function's parameters don't require it. However, the user hasn't specified, so maybe it's better to leave it out. But the user might expect Korean results. Let me check the function's parameters again. The language parameter is optional, so it's up to the function's implementation. Since the user is asking in Korean, perhaps the results should be in Korean. But the function might not support that. However, the user's instruction is to use the keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780' and get the results in text format. \n\nSo the correct function call is HNA_WQA.search with keyword='\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format='text', and max_results=10. The language parameter is optional, but since the user is using Korean, maybe include it. But the function's parameters don't specify that it's required. So maybe just the keyword, result_format, and max_results. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be HNA_WQA.search(keyword='\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format='text', max_results=10)."}

The user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday and wants a congratulatory message sent to him. First, I need to figure out how to get Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions don't include a direct way to look up personal information like birthdays from an external source. The functions provided are for sending messages, pausing heartbeats, managing memory, and making HTTP requests.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the 'recall_memory_search' function to search through conversation history for any mention of Shishir Patil's birthday. But the user hasn't provided any prior conversation where this information was mentioned. So that might not work. Alternatively, the 'archival_memory_search' could be used, but again, without any prior data in the archival memory, this might not help.\n\nSince the user is asking for information that isn't available through the provided functions, I need to check if there's a way to retrieve it. The 'http_request' function could be used to make an external API call to a database or website that has birthday information. However, the user hasn't provided any specific API endpoints or details on how to access such data. Without knowing the exact URL or method, this seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to have prior knowledge, but according to the functions, I can only use the ones listed. Since there's no function to fetch external data, I can't retrieve Shishir Patil's birthday. Therefore, I should inform the user that I can't access that information and suggest they provide the birthday details. But the user's instruction is to send a congratulatory message, so perhaps they expect me to proceed without the birthday. Wait, the message needs to include the birthday, so without that, I can't compose the message.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake and expects me to know the birthday. But according to the functions, I can't look it up. So the correct approach is to point out that I can't retrieve the birthday and thus can't send the message. However, the user might have intended for me to use the 'send_message' function with a placeholder or assume the birthday. But that's not accurate. Therefore, the answer is that I can't retrieve the birthday, so I can't send the message. But the user might have expected me to use the 'core_memory' functions. However, the core memory is initialized with the user's info, but in this case, the user hasn't provided that. So, the conclusion is that the necessary information isn't available through the provided functions, so I can't proceed."}

The account number is given, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions yet. Wait, the question mentions \"summary of transactions for this period,\" but the parameters for BankStatementOverView require a transaction_overview as a dictionary. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions. However, the TotalTransactions.calculate function might be used to calculate the totals, but the user already provided the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. Wait, the user's question includes all the necessary data for the BankStatementOverView. The transaction_overview parameter is a dictionary that should include the totals and counts. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_overview is just the totals. However, the function's description says it's a summary of transactions within the period, including totals and counts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to generate the summary. But the user is asking for an overview of the bank statement, which the BankStatementOverView function is designed for. The transaction_summary.generate might be used to generate the transaction details, but the user wants the overview, which includes the transaction summary. \n\nWait, the user's request is to provide an overview of the bank statement, which includes the account info and a summary of transactions. The BankStatementOverView function requires the transaction_overview as a parameter. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions. However, the user has given the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. Maybe the transaction_overview is a dictionary that includes these totals. \n\nBut the parameters for BankStatementOverView require the transaction_overview as a dict. So perhaps the user's provided data can be structured into that. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_overview is just the totals. But the function might require more detailed transaction data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the given totals as part of the transaction_overview. But the function's parameters don't specify what exactly is in the transaction_overview dict. The description says it's a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts. So perhaps the transaction_overview should include the total deposits, total withdrawals, number of transactions, etc. \n\nBut the user has provided the total deposits and withdrawals, starting and ending balances. The starting and ending balances are part of the BankStatementOverView parameters? Wait, no, the BankStatementOverView parameters are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The starting and ending balances are part of the transaction_overview. \n\nSo, the transaction_overview would be a dictionary that includes the starting balance, ending balance, total deposits, total withdrawals, and maybe the number of transactions. But the user hasn't provided the number of transactions. However, the user might not have that data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to generate the transaction summary, which would then be passed to the BankStatementOverView. But the user is asking for the overview, which includes the transaction summary. \n\nWait, the user's question is to provide an overview of the bank statement, which includes the account info and the transaction summary. The BankStatementOverView function is the one that provides that. However, the transaction_overview parameter is a dict that needs to be provided. The user has given the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be constructed with those values. \n\nBut the function's parameters don't specify the exact structure of the transaction_overview dict. However, the description says it's a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts. So maybe the transaction_overview should include the total deposits, total withdrawals, starting balance, ending balance, and the number of transactions. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the number of transactions. However, the user might not have that data. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used to generate the transaction summary, which would include the necessary data. \n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview of the bank statement, which includes the transaction summary. The BankStatementOverView function is the one that provides the overview. However, the transaction_overview parameter is required. Since the user has provided the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, perhaps those can be included in the transaction_overview. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_overview is just the totals. However, the function might require more detailed data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the given data, even if the transaction_overview is just the totals. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, including the transaction_overview as a dictionary containing the starting balance, ending balance, total deposits, total withdrawals. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the number of transactions, so maybe that's omitted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to generate the transaction summary, which would then be used in the BankStatementOverView. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_summary.generate can't be used. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have provided all the necessary data for the BankStatementOverView. \n\nSo, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n\naccount_type: \"checking\"\n\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n\ntransaction_overview: {\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the number of transactions, so that's missing. However, the function's description says the transaction_overview is a summary including totals and counts. So maybe the count is not provided, but the user hasn't given that data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_overview is just the totals, and the count is not required. \n\nIn that case, the function can be called with the given data. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nBankStatementOverView(bank_name=\"U.S. Bank\", account_number=\"1-523-1713-5704\", account_type=\"checking\", full_name=\"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\", transaction_overview={\"starting_balance\": 5532.01, \"ending_balance\": 6737.37, \"total_deposits\": 7132.76, \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40})\n\nBut the user also asked for a summary of transactions. However, the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview parameter is supposed to include that. So this should cover the request."}

The parameters required are employee_id, include_tools, and as_of_date. \n\nThe user provided the employee ID as \"Adriel\", so I need to check if the function expects a specific format for the employee_id. The parameter description says it's a unique identifier, so maybe \"Adriel\" is the correct value here. \n\nThe user didn't mention anything about tools specifically, but the function has an include_tools parameter. Since the question is about the tech stack in general, maybe including tools is necessary. However, the default might be to include them unless specified otherwise. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps it's safe to set include_tools to True to ensure all relevant techs are included.\n\nThe as_of_date parameter is optional and defaults to the current date.

That function's description says it exports VEX info for a project in CycloneDX format. The parameters required are uuid and download. The uuid is required, and download is optional.\n\nThe user didn't mention anything about downloading the file, just returning the VEX.

But the function's stay_length is the number of days they stay, so that's correct. The location isn't specified yet. The user hasn't mentioned the city. Also, they mentioned \"go to the studio sessions,\" but didn't specify the location. Maybe the location is implied by the context, but since it's not given, I need to check if the function requires it. The function does require location as a parameter. So the user hasn't provided the location yet. Therefore, I can't call the ReserveHotel function without the location. So I should ask for the location. But the user hasn't provided it.

However, maybe the function can handle it if the state is known. Alternatively, maybe the user is in Danville, CA, so I can assume that. But the user didn't specify, so maybe I should proceed with the given info. Alternatively, maybe the function can take just the city, but according to the parameters, it's required to be 'City, State'. So perhaps the user's input is missing the state. But since the user didn't provide it, maybe I need to proceed with the available info. Wait, the user's question is \"what's on\" at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville. So the location is Danville, but the function requires 'City, State'. So maybe the user's input is incomplete. However, maybe the function can handle it if the state is inferred. Alternatively, maybe the user is in Danville, CA, so I can use Danville, CA as the location. But the user didn't specify the state. Hmm. But the function requires the state. So perhaps the user's question is missing that. However, maybe the function can be called with just the city, but according to the parameters, it's required to be 'City, State'. Therefore, maybe the user's input is missing the state. But since the user didn't provide it, perhaps I need to proceed with the available info. Alternatively, maybe the function can be called with the city and state as Danville, CA. But the user didn't mention the state. This is a problem. However, maybe the function can be called with the city and state as Danville, CA, assuming that's the correct state. Alternatively, maybe the user is in Danville, CA, so that's the correct location. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, the user wants to find movies at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville (assuming Danville, CA). The function Movies_1_FindMovies requires location (as 'City, State'), theater_name (optional), genre (optional), and show_type (optional). The user specified show_type as Imax, and theater_name as Century Blackhawk Plaza. So the parameters would be location: \"Danville, CA\", theater_name: \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type: \"Imax\". The genre is not specified, so it can be left out. Therefore, the function call would be Movies_1_FindMovies with those parameters. That should retrieve the movies available at that theater with Imax show type."}

The user mentioned roundtrip, so the Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights function is the right choice. Let me check the parameters required for that function.\n\nThe parameters needed are origin_airport, destination_airport, departure_date, return_date, and optionally seating_class, number_of_tickets, and airlines. The user provided the departure date as March 12, 2023. The return date is a week later, so that would be March 19, 2023. \n\nThe origin is Atlanta, GA.

So the function call would be Weather_1_GetWeather(city=\"San Pablo, CA\", date=\"2023-04-11\"). \n\nI need to make sure that the date is correctly formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user specified the date as the upcoming Monday, so the calculation is correct. The function doesn't require any other parameters. So the correct function call is to use Weather_1_GetWeather with the city and the calculated date."}

The user wants to hear a Hillbilly style song from 2019 and mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" is good. First, I need to figure out which functions to use.\n\nThe user is asking to play a song, so the Music_3_PlayMedia function is relevant. But they also mentioned the genre (Hillbilly) and year (2019), which might be handled by Music_3_LookupMusic to find tracks first. Wait, but the user already knows the album, so maybe they want to play that specific album. However, the PlayMedia function can take artist, album, etc. But the user didn't specify an artist, just the genre and album. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user said \"Hillbilly style from 2019\" and the album \"Gotta Be Me\". So maybe first, use Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs in Hillbilly genre from 2019, then play them. But the user specifically mentioned the album, so maybe they want to play tracks from that album. However, the PlayMedia function can take the album parameter. But the user didn't mention the artist, so maybe the PlayMedia function can be called with the album name and genre. Wait, the PlayMedia function's parameters are track, artist, device, album. The user wants to play a song from the album \"Gotta Be Me\" which is Hillbilly style from 2019. But the PlayMedia function's description says it plays a specified track, optionally filtering by artist and album. So if the user wants to play a track from that album, maybe we need to first find the track using LookupMusic, then play it. But the user hasn't specified a track title yet. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play the album \"Gotta Be Me\" which is Hillbilly from 2019. But the PlayMedia function might require a track title. Wait, the PlayMedia function's track parameter is required. So maybe the user needs to specify a track. But the user hasn't given a track name. So perhaps the correct approach is to first use Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs in Hillbilly genre from 2019, then use PlayMedia with the found track. But since the user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\", maybe the LookupMusic can be used with album \"Gotta Be Me\", genre Hillbilly, year 2019. Then, once the tracks are found, play them. However, the user's message doesn't specify a track, so maybe the system needs to first look up the tracks and then play them. But the user's request is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the system should first look up the songs and then play them. But the functions need to be called in sequence. So first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once the tracks are found, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name from the lookup result. But since the user hasn't provided a track name, maybe the system needs to first perform the lookup. However, the user's message is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play the album \"Gotta Be Me\" which is Hillbilly from 2019. But the PlayMedia function requires a track. So perhaps the correct approach is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters to find tracks, then use that to play. But the user hasn't provided a track name, so the system might need to first look up the tracks. However, the user's message is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the system should first look up the songs and then play them. Therefore, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once the tracks are found, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name. But since the user hasn't specified a track, maybe the system can't proceed without that. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the album, so the PlayMedia function can be called with the album parameter. But the PlayMedia function's track is required. So perhaps the user needs to specify a track. But the user hasn't. Therefore, the correct approach is to first use Music_3_LookupMusic to find tracks that match the criteria, then play one of them. So the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once the tracks are found, the system can call PlayMedia with the track name. But since the user hasn't provided a track, the system can't proceed. However, the user's message is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the system should first look up the tracks and then play them. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. Then, the next step would be to play the found track. But the user's message is a single turn, so maybe the system should call both functions. Wait, but the user's message is in one turn. So the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls. So first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once that returns the tracks, call PlayMedia with the track name. But since the user hasn't provided a track name, the system can't call PlayMedia yet. Therefore, the first function call is LookupMusic to find the tracks. Then, the next step would be to play one of them. But the user's message is to \"hear a song\", so the assistant should first find the tracks and then play them. Therefore, the correct function calls are first Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters, then Music_3_PlayMedia with the track from the lookup. But since the user hasn't provided a track, the assistant can't call PlayMedia yet. Therefore, the assistant should first call the Lookup function. However, the user's message is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the assistant should call PlayMedia with the album parameter. But the PlayMedia function requires a track. Therefore, the assistant needs to first find the track using LookupMusic. So the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once that returns the tracks, the assistant can call PlayMedia with the track name. But in the current turn, the assistant can only make the first call. Therefore, the answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. However, the user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\", so maybe the assistant should include that in the Lookup. Therefore, the function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=Hillbilly, year=2019, album=Gotta Be Me. Then, once that's done, the assistant can play the track. But the user's message is to \"hear a song\", so the assistant should first find the tracks and then play them. Therefore, the correct function calls are first the Lookup, then the Play. But since the user hasn't provided a track, the assistant can't call Play yet. Therefore, the first function call is the Lookup."}

The category isn't specified, so I can leave it as \"dontcare\" or maybe specify a category like \"recreational parks\" but since the user didn't mention, better to use \"dontcare\" to include all categories. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for category have options like religious sites, parks, historical landmarks, etc. But the user didn't specify a category, so using \"dontcare\" is safer. So the function call would be Travel_1_FindAttractions with location=\"San Francisco, CA\", free_entry=\"True\", good_for_kids=\"True\", and category=\"dontcare\". That should fetch the required attractions."}

The user specified the amount as $90, the payment method is debit card, and the receiver is Alice. The parameters needed are all there.

The functions available are for hotels and trains. The user is asking about train tickets, so the relevant functions are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. Since they want to book tickets, the GetTrainTickets function is the right choice because it's for reserving tickets with specific parameters.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The user specified Portland, OR to Seattle, WA. The date is May 15, 2023, but the journey starts one day before. Wait, the date_of_journey is May 15, but the start time is one day before. Wait, the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so if the journey starts one day before, maybe the date is May 14? Or is the date_of_journey the actual date, and the start time is on that day? The user says \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But the function's date_of_journey is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user might mean that the journey starts on May 15, but the departure is one day before, which would be May 14. Wait, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before that day, so May 14. But the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so perhaps the user intended the journey to be on May 15, but the departure is at 12:00 AM on May 15, which is one day before May 16.

Wait, perhaps the user is saying that the journey is on May 15, but the train departs one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, meaning the departure is at 12:00 AM on May 15, which is the same day. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 14. But the user said \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". So perhaps the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before, meaning the departure is at 12:00 AM on May 15, which is the same day. So the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is 00:00. But that's not a day before. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But that's conflicting. Maybe the user intended the journey to be on May 14, but said May 15. This is a bit of a problem. However, given the information, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as 00:00, assuming that the user meant the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before the next day. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Maybe the user made a mistake. However, the function requires the date_of_journey as the date of the journey, so I'll use May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as 00:00. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the journey to be on May 14, but said May 15. But without more information, I'll proceed with the given date. \n\nNext, the number_of_adults is 4. The trip_protection is required and must be a boolean. The user said \"ensure trip protection is included\", so trip_protection should be True. The _class is business class, so _class is \"business\". \n\nSo the parameters would be: _from=\"Portland, OR\", to=\"Seattle, WA\", date_of_journey=\"2023-05-15\", journey_start_time=\"00:00\", number_of_adults=4, trip_protection=True, _class=\"business\". \n\nWait, but the user said \"starting at one day before\". If the journey is on May 15, then one day before would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. So maybe the journey starts on May 14, but the user said May 15. This is conflicting.

The function has an avg_rating parameter, so I'll set that to 4.5 or 5.0. \n\nNext, the location: Bangkok is the province, so province_id should be 1.

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the threshold is 5% error rate, and notifications should go to two emails.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The functions available are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application\", the create_global_application_alert_config is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (required), alert_type (required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (optional). The user provided the name, threshold as 5% (which is 0.05 as a float), and recipients as two emails. But wait, the alert_type isn't specified. The user mentioned \"error rate threshold\", so maybe the alert_type should be something like 'error_rate'. But the function requires alert_type, so I need to infer that. The user didn't specify, but the context implies it's an error rate. So I'll have to assume that. Alternatively, maybe the function expects a specific value, but since the user didn't provide it, perhaps it's part of the parameters. Wait, the user's question says \"for an error rate threshold of 5%\", so the alert_type is probably 'error_rate'. \n\nSo the parameters would be name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05, recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. The enabled parameter is optional, and the user didn't mention enabling it, so maybe leave it out or set to default (probably false). But the function requires the parameters listed, so as long as the required ones are there, it's okay. \n\nSo the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The other functions are for enabling or mobile apps, which don't fit here. So the correct call is the first function with the given parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user didn't mention anything about revoked tokens, so maybe I should default to not including them unless specified. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe include_revoked should be true? Wait, the function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Hmm, maybe that's not the right function.\n\nLooking at the other function, api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. This one also retrieves API tokens for the user. The parameters are include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe we need to set page and page_size appropriately. But the user didn't specify page or page size. The maximum page size is 100. If the user has many tokens, we might need to paginate, but the question says \"all\" so perhaps the function can handle that. However, the function's parameters don't mention a way to get all tokens in one call unless page is set to 1 and page_size to 100, but that's just a guess. The user might need to handle pagination if there are more than 100 tokens. But the user is asking for all, so maybe the function can return all when called with appropriate parameters. However, the user hasn't provided a username or password, which are required for the post_api_token function, but that's for creating tokens, not retrieving.\n\nWait, the get_api_tokens function doesn't require a username or password. It's for retrieving the user's tokens. But the user provided their user ID, not a username. The functions available are either using user_id or username. The get_shareable_api_tokens uses user_id, while get_api_tokens might use the username. But the user provided the user ID, so maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is the right one. However, the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. The get_shareable_api_tokens might only return shareable tokens, which might not be all. The other function, get_api_tokens, might return all tokens, but the parameters don't include user_id. Wait, looking at the parameters for get_api_tokens, there's no user_id parameter. The function's parameters are include_expired, page, and page_size. That's confusing. How does it know which user's tokens to retrieve? Maybe the username is used instead, but the user provided a user_id. Maybe the functions are designed such that the user is authenticated, so the API tokens are for the current user. But the user provided their user ID, so perhaps the get_api_tokens function is the right one, but the parameters don't include user_id. This is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens function is for shareable tokens, and the get_api_tokens is for all tokens. The user wants all, so maybe use get_api_tokens. But the user provided a user_id, but the function doesn't take it. Maybe the user is authenticated, so the function can retrieve their tokens without needing the user_id. But the user provided the user_id, so perhaps the get_shareable_api_tokens is the correct one. However, the user might not have provided the correct parameters for that function. Wait, the get_shareable_api_tokens requires user_id, which the user provided as 12345. So maybe that's the function to call. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So maybe that's not the right function. The other function, get_api_tokens, might return all tokens, but the parameters don't include user_id. So perhaps the user needs to use get_shareable_api_tokens with include_revoked=True to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the user might not have specified that. Alternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function is the correct one, but the user hasn't provided the necessary parameters like username. Wait, the user provided a user_id, but the functions don't take that. Maybe the user is authenticated, so the functions can retrieve their tokens without needing the user_id. But the user provided the user_id, so maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens is the right one. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's main request is to get all API tokens, and they provided their user ID. The get_shareable_api_tokens function requires user_id, so that's a possible candidate. The include_revoked parameter is optional. If the user wants all tokens, including revoked ones, then include_revoked=True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe default to False. However, the user might want all, so maybe set include_revoked=True. Alternatively, the get_api_tokens function might be the right one, but the parameters don't include user_id. So perhaps the user is supposed to use get_shareable_api_tokens with the provided user_id and include_revoked=True to get all tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function is for the current user, and the user_id is not needed because the user is authenticated. But the user provided the user_id, so maybe that's not the case. \n\nIn any case, the user provided the user_id, so the get_shareable_api_tokens function is the one that can be called with that parameter. The other function, get_api_tokens, might not take user_id. So the correct function to call is get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens. But the user might not have specified include_revoked, so maybe just call it without that parameter. However, the user wants all tokens, so including revoked ones. Therefore, the function call should be get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True."}

The first one seems to retrieve detailed info about specific experiences or education, while the second gives a list of experiences and education. The user is asking for details of a specific education, so maybe 'detail_experience_and_education' is more appropriate. \n\nThe parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' require the type (either experience or education) and an optional name. The user mentioned \"education at UNS\", so the type should be 'education' and the name would be 'Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters have 'experience_or_education_type' as a required field. So I need to set that to 'education' and 'experience_or_education_name' to the university name.

The user is asking for a reminder at a specific time, which sounds like an alarm. The set_alarm function can handle specific times, including dates and times in various formats.\n\nThe alarm_time parameter can be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format. The user specified December 1, 2023, which is '2023-12-01', and 7:00 AM. In 24-hour format, 7:00 AM is '07:00'. So the time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. The purpose is 'wake up' or 'meeting', but the user mentioned a meeting, so maybe 'meeting' is the purpose. However, the user said \"wake up early for a meeting\", so maybe the purpose is 'wake up'. But the function's purpose parameter is optional. Alternatively, maybe the purpose can be 'meeting'. But the main thing is the time.\n\nWait, the user says \"set a reminder for 7:00 AM\". The function set_alarm is for setting an alarm, which is similar to a reminder. So I should use set_alarm with the alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The user might want the purpose to be 'wake up' since they need to wake up for the meeting. But the purpose is optional, so maybe it's better to include it. Alternatively, maybe the purpose is 'meeting'. But the user's exact words are \"wake up early for a meeting\", so the purpose could be 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function's purpose is optional, so maybe just the time is enough. However, including the purpose might make it clearer. Let me check the function's parameters again. The purpose is optional, so it's not required. So the main thing is to set the alarm_time correctly.\n\nSo the correct function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The user might not have specified the purpose, but since they mentioned waking up for a meeting, maybe the purpose is 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function allows the purpose to be specified, so including it would be helpful. However, the user didn't explicitly mention the purpose, but the function's purpose is optional. So maybe just the time is sufficient. But the user might want to have the purpose as 'wake up' to indicate the reason. Alternatively, the purpose could be 'meeting'. But the user's main request is to set a reminder to wake up, so the purpose is 'wake up'. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00', purpose='wake up')."}
