The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. Wait, the calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest with constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). But wait, the function's parameters don't include acceleration. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe calculate_speed_from_rest function has args: distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (int, default 0). But how does that compute speed? Normally, if you have distance, time, and initial speed, you can calculate average speed, but to find final speed under constant acceleration, maybe they use the formula v = u + at, but they need acceleration. Alternatively, maybe they use the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2, but again, without acceleration, how?\n\nWait, maybe the function is designed to calculate the final speed using the given distance and time. Let me think. If the object starts from rest (u=0), then the distance s = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2. Solving for acceleration a = 2s / t\u00b2. Then, final speed v = u + a*t = 0 + (2s/t\u00b2)*t = 2s/t. So, v = 2*20 /4 = 10 m/s. But does the function calculate_speed_from_rest do that?\n\nThe function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest under constant acceleration over a specified distance. But the parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. Wait, maybe the function uses the formula v = 2s/t when initial speed is zero. But why is time a parameter? Because if you have distance and time, you can compute average speed, but under constant acceleration, the final speed would be 2s/t. So maybe that's what the function does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is using the formula s = (u + v)/2 * t. Since u=0, s = v*t/2 \u2192 v = 2s/t. Which is the same as before. So if the function is using that formula, then passing distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0 (default) would give v=2*20/4=10 m/s.\n\nSo the user's question is asking for the final speed, which would be calculated by calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default. So the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4. The parameters are integers, so 20 and 4 are okay. The initial_speed is 0, which is the default, so maybe it's not needed. But the function's parameters have initial_speed as an int with default 0. So including it or not is optional. But since the user says \"started from rest\", it's better to explicitly set initial_speed to 0.\n\nWait, but the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as an int with default 0. So the user's case fits here. So the function call would be:\n\n{\"function\": \"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\", \"parameters\": {\"distance\": 20, \"time\": 4, \"initial_speed\": 0}}.\n\nAlternatively, since initial_speed is default 0, maybe just distance and time are enough. But the user specified \"started from rest\", so including initial_speed=0 makes it explicit. However, the function's parameters have initial_speed as an int, but the user's input is 0, which is an int. So that's okay.\n\nSo the answer is to call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, initial_speed 0. The result would be 10 m/s."}
