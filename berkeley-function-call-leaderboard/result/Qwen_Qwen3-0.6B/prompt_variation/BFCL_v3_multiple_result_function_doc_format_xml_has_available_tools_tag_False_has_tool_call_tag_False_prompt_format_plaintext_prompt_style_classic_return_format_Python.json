The question is about displacement, so the first function is more appropriate. \n\nLooking at the parameters required for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, and time as 5 seconds. All required parameters are present. The rounding isn't specified, so maybe leave it out or set to a default. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters here. So the correct function call would be calculate_displacement with those values. The other function deals with final speed, which isn't needed here. So the answer should be that function call."}

The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region (optional, default US). The user specified the game title, platform (PlayStation), and region (United States). So I should call 'video_games.store_price' with those parameters. The other functions like 'video_games.on_sale' and 'video_games.store_currency' don't seem relevant here.

Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance is given as 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is asking for the final speed, which would be the final velocity.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check its parameters. The function requires distance, time, and optionally initial speed. The user provided all three: distance 20, time 4, and since it starts from rest, initial speed is 0. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have distance as an integer, time as an integer, and initial_speed as an integer. The user's data fits here. So I can call this function with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. \n\nAlternatively, the other function calculate_acceleration requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance.

Wait, but the problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. Hmm, maybe the height is 12 feet? Or is the wall's dimensions 30x12? The problem doesn't specify the height, but maybe the height is the same as the length or width? Wait, the user just says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. So maybe the area is 30*12 = 360 square feet. But the problem doesn't mention the height. Wait, maybe the height is 12 feet? Or maybe the height is the same as the length? Wait, the problem says \"a wall of 30 feet by 12 feet\". So perhaps the height is 12 feet, making the area 30*12 = 360 square feet. But if the height isn't specified, maybe the user expects that the height is 12 feet. Alternatively, maybe the height is the same as the length, so 30 feet. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here. Let me check again. The user wrote \"a wall of 30 feet by 12 feet\". So maybe the height is 12 feet. So the area is 30*12 = 360 square feet. \n\nNow, the paint coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon.
