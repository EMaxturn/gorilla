The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The required parameters are all provided here: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2 decimals. The user didn't specify rounding, so I'll use the default.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters match. The function expects integers for initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The given values are all integers. So the function call should include those three parameters. No need to include rounding since it's optional and the default is already 2.\n\nSo the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. That should compute the displacement using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Let me double-check the parameters. Yep, all required are present and correct. No other functions are needed here."}

The region has a default, but since the user specified it, I should include that. So I need to call store_price with those parameters.

Let me look at its parameters. It requires distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). The user provided distance=20 meters and time=4 seconds. Since initial speed is 0 (from rest), that's covered by the default. So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speed plus time, but we don't have final speed here. So yeah, the correct function is calculate_speed_from_rest."}

Yes, all four required parameters are given. So the correct function call is to use calculate_final_temperature with those values.

Let me calculate that: 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.\n\nNext, the coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. So, the amount of paint needed is the total area divided by the coverage rate.

The month is upcoming, so maybe the default value works, but the user specified \"upcoming month,\" so perhaps setting month to the current month or next? Wait, the default is upcoming events, so maybe leaving month as default is okay. But the user says \"upcoming month,\" so maybe specifying the month as the next month. However, the function's month parameter's default is to return upcoming events, so maybe it's better to set month to the current month or let it default. Also, user_ratings is set to 'high' by default, which aligns with \"top rated.\" So the parameters would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"sculpture\", and user_ratings: \"high\".
