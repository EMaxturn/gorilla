The user has three tasks here. First, calculate the total energy produced from consuming 5 moles of glucose with 10% efficiency. Second, find the biomass based on that energy and the efficiency. Third, calculate the work done by the machine using the energy and distance.\n\nStarting with the first task: The energy from glucose is 2800 kJ/mol per mole. So, 5 moles would be 5 * 2800 = 14,000 kJ. Then, since the efficiency is 10%, the biomass would be 14,000 * 0.1 = 1,400 kJ. That's the biomass.\n\nFor the third task, the work done is energy multiplied by distance. The energy is 14,000 kJ, and distance is 2 meters. So work = 14,000 * 2 = 28,000 J. Wait, but the units might need to be in joules. Let me check the parameters again. The energy is given as a float, and distance is a float. So yes, 14,000 * 2 = 28,000 J.\n\nNow, I need to structure these into function calls. The first function is biological.calc_energy, which takes mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The substance here is glucose (C6H12O6), and the energy per mole is 2800 kJ/mol. The user provided 5 moles, so mols is 5. The function requires substance and joules_per_mol.

So the first call would be biological.calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800.0).\n\nSecond, the biomass is energy * efficiency. The energy is 14,000 kJ, efficiency 0.1. So another function call would be biological.calc_biomass with energy=14000 and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, work is energy * distance. Energy is 14,000 kJ, distance 2 meters. So another function call: physical.calc_work(energy=14000, distance=2).\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. The first function uses the energy parameter, which is the total energy. The second function uses energy and efficiency. The third uses energy and distance. All required parameters are present.

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. The function available is get_collectables_in_season, which requires game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item type, so I'll use that.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The function game_score.highest needs game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia, so I'll input those parameters.\n\nThen, the lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided all these details, so I'll call that function with the given parameters.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability for 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided all three, so I'll use those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the right parameters. Let me check each step again to confirm there are no missing or incorrect parameters."}
