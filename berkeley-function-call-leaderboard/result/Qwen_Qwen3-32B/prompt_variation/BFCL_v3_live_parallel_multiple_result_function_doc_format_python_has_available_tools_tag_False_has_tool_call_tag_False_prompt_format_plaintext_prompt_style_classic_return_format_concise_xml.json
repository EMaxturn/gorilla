They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the Caesar salad, the function ChaFod seems appropriate. The foodItem is \"Caesar salad\". The user wants to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There are no new ingredients mentioned, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might include \"no anchovies\", but since removeIngredients is already handling that, maybe the specialInstructions can just note it again for clarity. But the function's parameters allow for removeIngredients as a separate field, so maybe just specify that.\n\nThen the drink order. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences need to be a dictionary. The user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. So the new_preferences would include \"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", and \"milk\": \"almond milk\". \n\nWait, but the function's new_preferences is a dict, so I need to structure all those parameters into that dict. The function's description says it's for updated preferences, so each key-value pair in the dict should represent a preference. So the drink_id is 123, and the new_preferences would have those four keys. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. For ChaFod, the removeIngredients is a comma-separated string. Since the user is removing anchovies, it's just \"anchovies\". For the drink, the new_preferences is a dictionary with the specified keys. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n2. ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nI need to check if all parameters are present. For ChaFod, the required parameter is foodItem, others are optional. The user provided that. For the drink, drink_id is required, and new_preferences is a dict. The user provided both. \n\nSo the final answer should have both function calls in the specified format."}

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is the right choice here. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so I'll set repo_url to that. The destination can be the current directory, so I can leave it as default. No need for recursive or depth unless specified, so those parameters can be omitted.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned to the current directory, the directory_name would be '.' or the default. But the user might have cloned it into a specific directory. Wait, the clone_repo's destination defaults to '.', so the directory_name for analysis would be '.' as well. \n\nOnce I know the language, I need to create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name. Again, assuming the repo is in the current directory, the directory_name is '.'.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory name. The deployment name, image name, replicas, port, and service type can be defaults unless specified. The user didn't provide specific values, so use defaults. The directory_name is '.' here too.\n\nAfter modifying files, push the changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory name, commit message, branch, and force push. The directory is '.', commit message can be default or custom, but the user says \"add all changed files\", so the commit message might need to reflect adding Docker and Kubernetes files. However, the function's default is 'Update changes', which should suffice. Branch is 'main' by default.\n\nWait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push function's description says it automatically adds all changes, so maybe that's covered. But the user might want to ensure that the changes are added, committed, and pushed. The push function handles add, commit, and push. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, calling push_git_changes_to_github should handle the rest.\n\nNow, check if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is '.' (since the repo is cloned to current dir). Then create_a_docker_file with directory_name '.'. Then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name '.', and other parameters as default. Finally, push with directory_name '.'.\n\nI need to make sure the order is correct: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. Each step depends on the previous.

The specific issue is that the method 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are the search string, case sensitivity, and whether to include subdirectories. Since they mentioned including subdirectories, I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and case sensitivity is probably not an issue here, so default to False.\n\nNext, the user needs the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to check their overrides. For each method, the 'get_signature' function is the right choice. The parameters required are the class name ('AbstractCellHandler'), the method name, and whether to include private methods. Since the user didn't mention private methods, I'll keep 'include_private' as the default False for both.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly specified.

Since the unit here is centimeters, but the function doesn't mention handling units, I'll just use the numerical value 5.0. So I'll call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, Country' or similar. Queenstown is a suburb of Singapore, so the location parameter should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to 'fahrenheit' as per the function's default.

So call get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore' and unit='fahrenheit'. Although, maybe the user expects Celsius. But since the function's default is fahrenheit, but the user might prefer Celsius. However, since the question doesn't specify, I should use the default. Or maybe the function can handle 'celsius' as well. The function's args say unit is a str with default 'fahrenheit'. So unless the user specifies, we use default.

I need to call this function with these parameters. Let me make sure all required arguments are included. The function doesn't mention any missing parameters. So, I'll structure the function call with event_type as \"concert\" and \"play\" separately? Wait, the function allows specifying one event_type at a time. Maybe I need to make two separate calls. But the user said \"any music concerts or theater plays\", so perhaps combining them. However, the function might not support multiple types in one call. Hmm, but maybe the event_type can accept multiple values. Wait, looking at the function definition, the event_type is a single string. So perhaps I should make two separate function calls. But the user might want both types. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle a list, but the parameters are defined as single strings. The function's Args for event_type is a single string.
