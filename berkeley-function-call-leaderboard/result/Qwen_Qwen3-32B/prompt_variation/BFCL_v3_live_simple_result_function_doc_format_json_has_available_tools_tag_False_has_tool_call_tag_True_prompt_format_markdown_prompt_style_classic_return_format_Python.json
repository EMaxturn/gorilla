The parameters required are url and params. The url should be the base path without query parameters. The example given in the function is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So I need to replace {ip} with the provided IP address, 192.120.45.67. That makes the url 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nNext, the params dictionary.

The example URL in the function's parameters seems a bit complex. Let me check if that's the correct path. The function's description mentions retrieving interface information from a network telemetry API. The example URL includes parts like 'sedgeapi', 'cisco-nir', 'telemetry', 'flowrules', and 'interfaceInfo'. But I'm not sure if that's the exact path for the Nexus Dashboard API.

Let me check if that's the correct path. Maybe the correct path is something like 'https://{ip}/api/v1/telemetry/interfaceInfo' or similar. But since the function's example is provided, perhaps the user is supposed to use that exact structure.\n\nWait, the function's parameters for the URL have an example with 'sedgeapi' and 'cisco-nir' parts. Maybe that's specific to a certain API structure. The user is asking about Cisco Nexus Dashboard, which might have a different API path. However, given that the available function is fixed, I have to use the URL format provided in the function's parameters. So the URL would be constructed by replacing {ip} with the given IP address. So the URL becomes 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nThen, the params dictionary should include all the parameters provided by the user: fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType. The function's parameters for 'params' include these as valid keys. The interfaceType has an enum, and the user provided 'Ethernet', which is in the enum list. The infoType has an enum, and 'Speed' is one of the options.
