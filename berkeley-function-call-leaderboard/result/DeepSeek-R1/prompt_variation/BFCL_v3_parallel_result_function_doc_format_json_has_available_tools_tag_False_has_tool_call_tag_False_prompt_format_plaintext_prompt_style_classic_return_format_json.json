It requires:\n   - location (string): e.g., \"San Diego, CA\"\n   - movie (array of strings): which should be from the enum: ['Tenet', 'No Time To Die']\n   - time (array of strings): show times for each movie\n\n However, note that the function expects an array for both 'movie' and 'time'. We have two movies and two specific times.\n\n We are to find theatres that have both showings? Or we can call the function for each movie? But note the function can take an array of movies and an array of times.\n\n The description says: \"Find local movie theatres and their schedule for a specific movie\" (singular). But the parameters allow an array of movies and an array of times.\n\n Let's interpret: \n   - We are to find theatres that have both movies at the specified times? But the function might not support that. It might be that we can pass multiple movies and multiple times and it returns theatres that have any of them? Or all?\n\n The function parameters do not specify whether it's a union (any) or intersection (all). But the description says \"for a specific movie\", which is singular. However, the parameter is an array. \n\n Given the ambiguity, we have two options:\n   1. Call the function once with both movies and both times and hope it returns theatres that have both showings? But note the function might not be designed for that.\n   2. Call the function twice: once for Tenet at 5 pm and once for No Time To Die at 7:30 pm, and then intersect the theatres that appear in both? But we are only allowed to call the provided function.\n\n However, the function does not return a list of theatres in a way that we can process (because we are only allowed to call functions, and we don't have a function to process the results). Therefore, we must rely on the function to do the filtering.\n\n Since the problem says \"with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\", we want theatres that have both.\n\n But note: the function might not support querying for two movies at two specific times simultaneously. The parameters are arrays, so let's try to call it with:\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n However, there is a problem: how does the function know which time corresponds to which movie? The parameters are two separate arrays. It might interpret as: for each movie, we are providing multiple times? Or for each movie, we are providing one time? The function description doesn't specify.\n\n Alternatively, we might have to make two separate calls? But then we cannot get the same theatre that has both? We would have to combine the results? But we don't have a function for that.\n\n Given the constraints, we must use the provided function. Since the function allows an array of movies and an array of times, we can try:\n\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n But note: the function might be designed to look for each movie at any of the provided times? Or it might be that the times are for the respective movies? Without documentation, we assume the order: the first time for the first movie, the second time for the second movie? Or it might be that the function expects the same number of movies and times and matches by index.\n\n However, the function's parameters are defined as:\n   - movie: array of strings (with enum) -> so we can pass two movies.\n   - time: array of strings -> we can pass two times.\n\n And the function is supposed to return theatres that have the specified movies at the specified times? Or at any of the times? The description is not clear.\n\n But the problem says: \"availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\". So we want a theatre that has Tenet at 5 pm AND also has No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\n\n We have to hope that the function supports this when we pass both movies and both times? Or we might get theatres that have Tenet at 5 pm OR No Time To Die at 7:30 pm? \n\n Since we cannot write code to combine, and the problem asks for two theatres that have both, we must call the function in a way that it returns theatres with both.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the problem into two calls and then we would have to remember the results? But we are only allowed to output function calls and we don't have memory? \n\n The instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\"\n\n However, we are only allowed to output function calls in the specified format and then the system will run them and return the results? Then in the next turn we might get the results and we can do another function call? But the problem says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete\"\n\n But the user's request is to find two movie theatres that have both showings. We cannot do that in one function call? Because the function might not return the intersection? \n\n Considering the ambiguity, and because the function does not specify how it handles multiple movies and times, we have to assume that it returns theatres that have at least one of the movie-time pairs? That would not satisfy the requirement.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function for each movie separately and then in the next turn we can compare? But we are only allowed to output function calls in one turn? And we don't have a function to compare? \n\n The problem says: \"Find two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\"\n\n We must return two theatres that have both. \n\n How about we call the function once for Tenet at 5 pm and then once for No Time To Die at 7:30 pm? Then we get two lists of theatres. Then we would need to find the intersection? But we don't have a function for that.\n\n Since we are constrained by the available functions, and we only have one function, we cannot do set intersection. Therefore, we must rely on the function to do the AND condition.\n\n Let's assume that the function, when passed two movies and two times, will return theatres that have the first movie at the first time AND the second movie at the second time? That would be ideal. But the description doesn't say.\n\n However, the function parameters are designed to take multiple movies and multiple times, so it's possible that it is intended for such use.\n\n We'll make one call with:\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n And we ask for two theatres? But note the function doesn't have a parameter for the number of theatres. It will return as many as it finds? And we are to pick two? But we cannot, because we don't have a function to limit.\n\n The function doesn't have a parameter for the number of results. So we'll just have to hope it returns at least two? And then we can present two? But the problem says \"find two\", so we need at least two.\n\n However, we are only making the function call. The system will return the results. We don't have to worry about the number? We just return the function call.\n\n But note: the function requires the parameters. We have:\n   location: we are given \"San Diego\", but the function expects city and state. We can assume \"San Diego, CA\"?\n   movie: we have two movies: \"Tenet\" and \"No Time To Die\", which are in the enum.\n   time: we have two times: \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\"\n\n So we can form the call.\n\n However, the function requires all three parameters. We have them.\n\n Therefore, we will make one function call with both movies and both times.\n\n But note: the function expects the time to be an array of strings. We are providing two strings: \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\". We must be cautious: the function might interpret the time strings in a specific format? The example doesn't specify, but we are given in the problem: \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\". So we use exactly that.\n\n We are to return the function call in the specified format.\n\n Important: We must output exactly in the format:\n\n ```json\n [{\"function\": \"find_movie_showing\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"San Diego, CA\", \"movie\": [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], \"time\": [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]}}]\n ```\n\n But note: the problem says \"near San Diego\", so we use \"San Diego, CA\" as the location.\n\n However, the problem asks for two theatres. The function might return more than two? We don't have a way to limit to two. So we just make the call and then the system will return the results. We are only responsible for the function call.\n\n Since we are only allowed to output function calls and nothing else, we output the above.\n\n But wait: what if the function doesn't support multiple movies? The enum is a list of two, and we are passing two. It should be allowed.\n\n Let's do it."}

But note: the function expects a string. We can try to interpret \"next Friday\" as a relative date, but without knowing the current date, we cannot.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can note that the user's request lacks the exact date (because we don't know what day today is). Therefore, we should point out that we need the exact date?

But the function does not specify the format. It just says a string.\n\nBut note: the function does not specify the format of the date. So we can pass a string that says \"next Friday\"? That might not be machine-readable. Alternatively, we can compute the date of next Friday and then pass it in YYYY-MM-DD format?

But that's not reliable.\n\nb) Since the problem says \"if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out\", we should point out that we need the exact date? But note: we are only allowed to output function calls in the required format, or point out the issue. However, the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nBut how to point it out?

If we pass a relative date string, the backend might not be able to process it. Therefore, it is better to have the exact date.\n\nAlternatively, we can break the problem:\n\nWe are to make one or more function calls. We can call the function for each city, and for the date we can use the string \"next Friday\", but that is risky. Alternatively, we can note that the function requires a date and we don't have it, so we cannot complete.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks\". So we can try to interpret \"next Friday\" as a relative date? Actually, we are an AI, so we can compute the date if we know the current date. But we don't. So we are stuck.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we must decide: \n\nOption: We call the function for both cities with the date as \"next Friday\" and hope the backend can interpret it? But that's not safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can ask for the current date? But we don't have a function to ask the user. We are only allowed to call the given functions.\n\nTherefore, we must either not call the function and point out the lack of parameters, or call it with the relative string.\n\nBut note: the function's description does not specify the date format. It just says a string. So it is possible that the backend expects relative strings? We don't know.\n\nGiven that the user said \"next Friday\", we can pass that string. But then the amenities: the user wants parking. The amenities parameter is an array, and we can set it to ['Parking'].\n\nBut the function has a default of ['Parking'], so if we don't specify, it will use that. However, the user explicitly said \"available parking\", so we can set amenities to ['Parking'] to be explicit.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nFor Berlin:\n  location: \"Berlin\"\n  date: \"next Friday\"\n  genre: \"classical\"\n  amenities: [\"Parking\"]   (but note the enum: it's \"Parking\", so we must use that exact string)\n\nFor Paris:\n  location: \"Paris\"\n  date: \"next Friday\"\n  genre: \"classical\"\n  amenities: [\"Parking\"]\n\nBut note: the function requires the parameters: location, date, genre. We have all. And amenities is optional but we are providing it to be explicit.\n\nHowever, the function call must be in the format:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"concert.find_nearby\",\"parameters\":{\"location\":\"Berlin\",\"date\":\"next Friday\",\"genre\":\"classical\",\"amenities\":[\"Parking\"]}}, ...]\n```\n\nBut wait: the user said \"near Berlin and Paris\". The function is for one location at a time, so we make two calls.\n\nBut note: the function name is \"concert.find_nearby\", and it takes one location. So we call it twice.\n\nSo we will return two function calls in the array.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: we should only return the function calls in the format. So:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"concert.find_nearby\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"location\": \"Berlin\",\n      \"date\": \"next Friday\",\n      \"genre\": \"classical\",\n      \"amenities\": [\"Parking\"]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"concert.find_nearby\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"location\": \"Paris\",\n      \"date\": \"next Friday\",\n      \"genre\": \"classical\",\n      \"amenities\": [\"Parking\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBut note: the date string \"next Friday\" might be ambiguous. However, without a way to compute the exact date, this is the best we can do. Alternatively, we might point out the lack of exact date? But the instruction doesn't specify how to point out. And we are only allowed to output the function calls in the specified format.\n\nSo we proceed with the above.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the user provided the date as \"next Friday\", which is a string. So we are providing the string. It's up to the backend to interpret. Therefore, we are fulfilling the requirement.\n\nSo we output the two function calls."}

Calculate the highest common factor (HCF) of (45, 60), then use that result to find the HCF with (90, 120).\n    - Step 1: HCF1 = hcf(45, 60)\n    - Step 2: HCF2 = hcf(HCF1, hcf(90, 120))? \n      But note: the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\".\n      This could be interpreted as:\n        Option A: HCF_final = hcf( HCF1, hcf(90,120) )   [i.e., HCF of the first result and the HCF of the second pair]\n        Option B: HCF_final = hcf( HCF1, 90, 120 ) but our function only takes two numbers.\n\n    However, the function we have only takes two numbers at a time. So we must break it down.\n\n    Actually, the user says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\".\n    This is ambiguous. But note: the HCF of a set of numbers can be found by iteratively applying the two-number HCF.\n\n    But the problem says \"with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". This suggests that we are to take the result (a single number) and then find the HCF of that single number and the pair? That doesn't make sense because the pair is two numbers.\n\n    Alternatively, it might mean: take the result (a single number) and then find the HCF of that number and 90, and then with 120? But note the pair (90,120) is given.\n\n    Let me re-read: \"find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". This seems to indicate that we are to find the HCF of the entire set {result, 90, 120}. However, our function only takes two numbers.\n\n    We can break it down:\n      Step 1: Find HCF of 45 and 60 -> let this be x.\n      Step 2: Then find the HCF of x and 90 -> let that be y.\n      Step 3: Then find the HCF of y and 120 -> let that be z.\n\n    But note: the HCF of three numbers a, b, c is hcf(a, hcf(b, c)). Similarly for four numbers.\n\n    However, the problem says \"with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". This might imply that we are to treat (90,120) as a pair and then combine with the previous result? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". This could mean:\n        Option: We are to find the HCF of the first result (which is a number) and the HCF of the second pair (90,120). \n        That is: hcf( x, hcf(90,120) )\n\n    This is a valid interpretation and also efficient.\n\n    So:\n      Step 1: x = hcf(45,60)\n      Step 2: y = hcf(90,120)\n      Step 3: z = hcf(x, y)\n\n 2. Similarly for the second part: \n    - Step 1: a = hcf(36,48)\n    - Step 2: b = hcf(72,96)\n    - Step 3: c = hcf(a, b)\n\n But note: the problem says: \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96)\".\n    This is ambiguous: does it mean to find the HCF of the result (a) and the entire pair (72,96) or the HCF of the result and the HCF of (72,96)? \n    Similar to above, I think the intended meaning is: \n        Step 1: a = hcf(36,48)\n        Step 2: b = hcf(72,96)\n        Step 3: c = hcf(a, b)\n\n However, note the wording: \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96)\".\n    This could be interpreted as: hcf(a, 72, 96). But again, our function only takes two numbers. So we must break it into two steps: \n        Step 2a: b = hcf(72,96)\n        Step 2b: c = hcf(a, b)\n\n But the problem says \"with the pair\", which might imply that we are to combine the single result with the two numbers? \n    We can do: \n        Step 2: temp = hcf(a, 72)\n        Step 3: c = hcf(temp, 96)\n\n    However, note that the HCF of three numbers can be found in either way: hcf(a, hcf(72,96)) is the same as hcf(hcf(a,72),96). \n\n    But the problem does not specify the order. However, the most straightforward is to compute the HCF of the pair (72,96) first and then combine with the previous result.\n\n    So I'll go with:\n        For the first part: \n            x = hcf(45,60)\n            y = hcf(90,120)\n            z = hcf(x, y)\n\n        For the second part:\n            a = hcf(36,48)\n            b = hcf(72,96)\n            c = hcf(a, b)\n\n However, note that the problem asks to do both parts and then presumably return both results? But the problem doesn't say to combine the two parts. They are separate.\n\n Therefore, we need to compute two separate results.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Please also ...\", meaning two independent requests.\n\n Steps:\n\n  First, for the first chain:\n    1. Call math.hcf(45,60) -> result1\n    2. Call math.hcf(90,120) -> result2\n    3. Call math.hcf(result1, result2) -> final_result1\n\n  Second, for the second chain:\n    1. Call math.hcf(36,48) -> result3\n    2. Call math.hcf(72,96) -> result4\n    3. Call math.hcf(result3, result4) -> final_result2\n\n However, note that we cannot call multiple functions at once? The system expects a sequence of function calls. We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one response? The format says it can be a list of function calls.\n\n So we can output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 45, \"number2\": 60}},\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 90, \"number2\": 120}},\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 36, \"number2\": 48}},\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 72, \"number2\": 96}}\n]\n```\n\n But note: we don't have the results of the first two to compute the next step. We cannot do the step 3 until we have the results of step1 and step2.\n\n Therefore, we must break the process into multiple turns? However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n But note: the system will remember the results of previous function calls in the same turn? Actually, the instruction says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\n However, the problem is: we cannot call the third step until we have the results of the first two. So we cannot do all in one go because we don't know the intermediate results.\n\n How does the system work? It seems we are to output the function calls in one response and the system will execute them and then we get the results? But the instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ...\". It doesn't say we can only output one call per response.\n\n And the format shows an array of function calls. So we can output multiple.\n\n However, the system might execute the functions in order and then we can use the results of earlier calls in later calls? But note: the parameters of the later functions depend on the results of the earlier ones. We don't know the results until they are computed.\n\n Therefore, we cannot do the third step in the same response because we don't know the intermediate results.\n\n This implies we must break the process into multiple turns.\n\n But the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" and we are to output only function calls in the response. \n\n How can we handle this?\n\n We have two options:\n\n Option 1: Output the first set of independent calls (the four calls above) and then in the next turn, when we get the results, we can compute the next step.\n\n However, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" meaning we should output as many function calls as we can in one turn? But we cannot because we don't have the intermediate results.\n\n Option 2: We note that the problem is broken into two independent chains. We can compute the first chain in one turn? Actually, no, because the third step in the first chain depends on the first two steps.\n\n Therefore, we must do:\n\n Turn 1: \n   We can only compute the first step for both chains? But note the chains are independent. We can compute all the base pairs.\n\n   So we output:\n      [\n        {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 45, \"number2\": 60}},\n        {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 90, \"number2\": 120}},\n        {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 36, \"number2\": 48}},\n        {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 72, \"number2\": 96}}\n      ]\n\n   Then the system will return a list of results: [result1, result2, result3, result4]\n\n Turn 2:\n   Now we can compute:\n        z = hcf(result1, result2)   for the first chain\n        c = hcf(result3, result4)   for the second chain\n\n   So we output:\n        [\n          {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": result1, \"number2\": result2}},\n          {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": result3, \"number2\": result4}}\n        ]\n\n But note: we don't have the actual values of result1, result2, result3, result4 until the system runs the first set.\n\n Therefore, we cannot hardcode the numbers in the second turn. We have to refer to the results from the first turn.\n\n However, the system does not specify how we reference previous results. We are only allowed to output function calls in the specified format? And the parameters must be integers.\n\n This suggests that we must do the entire computation in one turn? But that is impossible without knowing the intermediate results.\n\n Alternatively, the system might be designed to handle multiple turns and we are to break the process. The instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n So in the first response, we output the first set of calls. Then the system will run them and give us the results. Then in the next response, we use those results to make the next calls.\n\n But note: the parameters in the function call must be integers. We cannot put a variable. We must put the actual integer.\n\n How do we get the actual integer? We have to wait for the system to run the first set and then we can use the results as numbers in the next call.\n\n Therefore, we must break it into two turns.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in the first turn, we have all the parameters? Yes, because the numbers are given.\n\n But in the second turn, we will have the intermediate results from the system. We are not expected to output the second set until we have the results.\n\n So the plan:\n\n Turn 1: \n   We output the four function calls for the base pairs.\n\n Turn 2: \n   The system returns the four results. Then we output two function calls: \n        hcf(result1, result2) and hcf(result3, result4)\n\n But note: the problem asks for the results of these chains. We are then done.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Can you calculate ... and then ... and then ...\". So we are expected to return the final results.\n\n But we are only outputting function calls. The system will then run them and return the results.\n\n How do we return the results to the user? The system will handle that.\n\n But note: we are only to output function calls until we have done all we can. After the second turn, we have done all the computations.\n\n Therefore, we must do two turns.\n\n However, the current instruction is for one turn. We are only to respond for the current turn. \n\n How does the multi-turn work? The problem says: \"At each turn\", meaning we are to respond with function calls for the current turn only.\n\n So in the first turn, we can only output the functions that we can call with the given parameters.\n\n We have the parameters for the base pairs, so we output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 45, \"number2\": 60}},\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 90, \"number2\": 120}},\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 36, \"number2\": 48}},\n  {\"function\": \"math.hcf\", \"parameters\": {\"number1\": 72, \"number2\": 96}}\n]\n```\n\n Then, in the next turn, when we have the results, we will output the next set.\n\n But note: the problem says we should only return the function calls in the response. We are not to include any other text.\n\n So for the first turn, we output the above.\n\n However, the problem might be expecting the entire computation in one turn? But that is not possible because of the dependencies.\n\n Alternatively, we might be allowed to compute the entire chain for one part and then the other? But note the chains are independent and we can compute the base pairs in any order.\n\n But the dependencies within a chain prevent us from doing the entire chain in one go.\n\n Therefore, we break it.\n\n But note: the system might not support multiple function calls that depend on each other in one response? Because we cannot use the result of a previous call in the same response.\n\n So we do:\n\n Turn 1: Output the base pairs.\n\n Then, after we get the results, in Turn 2: we output the next level.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the system's multi-turn behavior. But the instruction says we can continue until we have fulfilled the request.\n\n So we do as above.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and we are using the function. And we have the parameters for the base pairs.\n\n Therefore, for the current turn, we output the base pairs.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"to achieve the purpose\". The purpose is to compute the final results. We are only doing the first step. But the instruction says: \"try your best to complete the tasks ... within the current turn\". We cannot complete the entire task in one turn because we lack intermediate results. So we do what we can.\n\n So we output the base pairs.\n\n But note: the problem asks for two chains. We are outputting four function calls for the base pairs of both chains.\n\n This is the best we can do in the first turn.\n\n Let me reexamine: \n   The problem says: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find ...\" \n   We are calculating the first step of the first chain and the first step of the second chain? Actually, we are calculating the base pairs for both chains? But note the second chain also has two base pairs: (36,48) and (72,96) are the base pairs? Actually, the second chain has two steps as well: first (36,48) and then that result with (72,96). But the base pairs are (36,48) and (72,96) and then we combine the results.\n\n However, the problem does not require the intermediate results to be shown? It just wants the final results. But we are breaking the computation.\n\n So we do:\n\n   Turn 1: Compute the base pairs: [hcf(45,60), hcf(90,120), hcf(36,48), hcf(72,96)]\n\n   Turn 2: Then we compute hcf( result1, result2 ) and hcf( result3, result4 )\n\n   Then we are done.\n\n Therefore, for the first turn, we output the four base pair computations.\n\n Let me write the first response accordingly."}

A less detailed description of a muscle cell in the human body.\n\n We have one function: biology.get_cell_info\n This function takes:\n   - cell_type (required): the type of cell (string)\n   - detailed (optional, default false): boolean indicating if detailed description is wanted.\n\n For the neuron cell, we want detailed information -> set detailed to true.\n For the muscle cell, we want less detailed -> so we can use the default (false) or explicitly set it to false.\n\n We note that the function can be called multiple times. We'll make two separate calls.\n\n Steps:\n 1. First call: \n      function: biology.get_cell_info\n      parameters: {\"cell_type\": \"neuron\", \"detailed\": true}\n\n 2. Second call:\n      function: biology.get_cell_info\n      parameters: {\"cell_type\": \"muscle cell\", \"detailed\": false} \n      (Note: we could omit detailed for the second call since false is default, but to be explicit we include)\n\n However, note that the user asked for \"muscle cell in the human body\". We can specify \"muscle cell\" and trust the function to focus on human if that's the context? \n But the function doesn't have a parameter for organism. Since the question specifies \"in the human body\", but our function only takes cell_type and detailed. \n We must assume that the function is designed to handle such context (i.e., when we ask for a muscle cell and the context is human, it returns human muscle cell). \n Alternatively, the function might be general and return information that is common? However, the function description doesn't specify. \n Since the function is the only one we have, we must use it and hope that the cell_type \"muscle cell\" in the context of human body is covered.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to be more specific by using \"human muscle cell\", but the function doesn't specify how specific the cell_type should be. \n We'll go with \"muscle cell\" and hope it returns the human one if that's the primary context.\n\n If we are unsure, we might call for \"muscle cell\" and then if the result is not specific to human, we might need to adjust? But we can only call the function as provided.\n\n Since the problem says \"in the human body\", we can try to specify in the cell_type: \"human muscle cell\". But note the function parameters: the cell_type is a string. \n We are not constrained to a fixed set? So we can try to be more specific.\n\n However, the function does not specify that it takes an organism. So we have two options:\n   Option 1: Use \"muscle cell\" and hope the function returns the human one by default in the context of biology (if the function is designed for human biology).\n   Option 2: Use \"human muscle cell\" to be explicit.\n\n Since the function is designed to retrieve information about a specified type of cell, and the user is asking in the context of human body, we'll use \"human muscle cell\".\n\n But note: the function might not recognize \"human muscle cell\" if it expects a more standard term. The standard term might be \"muscle cell\" and the function might be designed for human by default? \n Without knowing the underlying data, we have to make a choice.\n\n Alternatively, the function might have a standard set of cell types. The example in the function parameters doesn't specify. \n\n Since the question is about the human body, we'll use:\n   For the neuron: \"neuron\" (which is standard and should be the same in human and other animals, but we are focusing on human)\n   For the muscle cell: we can use \"muscle cell\" and assume it's human? Or use \"human skeletal muscle cell\"? But the user didn't specify the type of muscle (skeletal, cardiac, smooth). \n\n The user just said \"muscle cell\". So we can either:\n   - Ask for a general muscle cell (which might cover all types) but then the description might be too broad? \n   - Or we can choose one? But the user didn't specify.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will use \"muscle cell\" and hope the function returns a general description that applies to human.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function might be designed to return information for the most common type or aggregate? We don't know.\n\n We'll proceed with:\n   First call: neuron with detailed=true\n   Second call: muscle cell with detailed=false\n\n We'll use the exact string \"muscle cell\" for the second.\n\n However, if the function is designed to work with specific terms, we should use the most standard. \n In biology, the term for a muscle cell is also \"myocyte\". But the user said \"muscle cell\", so we can use that.\n\n Therefore, we make two function calls.\n\n Format: \n We return a list of two function calls in the required JSON format."}
