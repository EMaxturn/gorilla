There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the function ChaFod is needed. The parameters are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user says \"without anchovies,\" so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". The foodItem is Caesar salad. The specialInstructions might be \"no anchovies\" but the function's default is empty, so I'll set that.\n\nThen for the drink, the function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences should include the size (large), type (hot), sweetness (regular), and milk (almond).

The user wants to perform several actions based on the given steps. Let me break down each step and see which functions I can use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. Since the user didn't specify the destination, I'll use the default which is the current directory. Recursive and depth are optional, so I can leave them as default.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name. The analysis is done using the analyse_repo_contents function, which needs the directory name. But wait, the user hasn't specified the directory name yet. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination is the directory where the repo is cloned. So after cloning, the directory is 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo URL is correct). So I need to call analyse_repo_contents on that directory. Then, use the output of that analysis to create the Dockerfile. But the create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name, which would be the same as the cloned directory. So maybe after cloning, I can call analyse_repo_contents on the cloned directory, then call create_a_docker_file with that directory.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory name, which again would be the same as the cloned directory. So after analysing the repo, the directory is the same, and the function is called with that directory.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory name and other parameters. But wait, the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is similar to git add --all. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github is supposed to push changes. But the user might need to first add the changes. However, the function's description says it automatically adds all changes. So maybe the function handles that. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, so maybe the function is used here. But the parameters include directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The user hasn't specified commit message, branch, or force push, so default values are used.\n\nStep 4 is to commit and push. The push_git_changes_to_github function would be used here with the default branch (main) and commit message. But the user might need to specify the commit message. However, the user's step 4 says to commit and push, so the function would handle that.\n\nNow, let's structure the function calls.\n\nFirst, clone the repo:\n\nclone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\", destination=\".\") \n\nThen, analyse the repo contents:\n\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n\nThen, create Dockerfile:\n\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs:\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", deployment_name=\"default\", image_name=\"latest\", replicas=1, port=80, service_type=\"ClusterIP\")\n\nThen, push the changes:\n\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message=\"Update changes\", branch_name=\"main\", force_push=False)\n\nWait, but the push_git_changes_to_github function's parameters have default values. The user's step 3 says to add all changed files, which the function does. Then step 4 is to commit and push, which the function does with the default commit message and branch.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is handled by the function. So the order is correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the functions are called in the correct order. The user's steps are 1 to 4, so the functions should be called in that order.\n\nSo the JSON would have the following function calls:\n\nFirst, clone_repo.\n\nThen analyse_repo_contents.\n\nThen create_a_docker_file.\n\nThen create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\nThen push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut wait, the user's steps are 1. clone, 2. analyse and create dockerfile and kubernetes, 3. add changes, 4. commit and push.\n\nSo the functions are called in the order of steps 1-4.\n\nSo the JSON would have all these function calls in order."}

They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The user provided four functions: get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe first part of the question is about finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search_string would be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories is set to True. The case_sensitive can be left as default (False) unless the user wants case-sensitive search, but since they didn't specify, it's safe to assume False.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function is designed to retrieve method signatures. However, the parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user is asking for the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. So, I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. \n\nWait, the user mentioned 'AbstractCellHandler' as the class, so the class_name would be 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method_name would be 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional, defaulting to False, so we can omit it unless specified. \n\nBut the user is asking for both methods, so I need to make two separate function calls. Each call will have the class_name as 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method_name as either 'setCellValue' or 'getCellValue'. \n\nThe other functions, like get_class_info and get_imports, don't seem relevant here. The get_imports function is for suggesting imports in code snippets, which isn't the case here. \n\nSo, the plan is: call get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', case_sensitive False, include_subdirectories True. Then call get_signature twice, once for each method. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted in JSON. Each function call should be in the specified format. Also, check if the parameters are correctly named. For example, the get_relevant_classes has parameters search_string, case_sensitive, include_subdirectories. The get_signature has class_name and method_name. \n\nSo the JSON should include both function calls. The user might need to have the relevant classes listed and the method signatures.

That should give the area as 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location and an optional unit. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\", but I need to check if that's a valid format. The function's example includes \"San Francisco, CA\" or \"Paris, France\", so \"Queenstown Singapore\" might be acceptable. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I can use the default, which is Fahrenheit. However, Singapore uses Celsius, but the function's unit is default to Fahrenheit. Wait, the function's description says the unit is default to Fahrenheit, but maybe the user wants Celsius. But since the user didn't specify, I should use the default. So I'll call get_current_weather with location \"Queenstown Singapore\" and unit 'fahrenheit' or leave it out. But the function's parameters say unit is optional, so maybe it's better to include it. But the user didn't mention the unit, so maybe just the location is enough. However, the function might require the unit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be set to 'concert' or 'theater play' and the function will list both.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be a list, but the function's parameters don't specify that. The function's description says \"event_type (str): The category of the cultural event.\" So it's a single string.
