The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nThe parameters required for calculate_displacement are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, but maybe the user wants two decimal places. \n\nWait, the default for rounding is 2, so maybe I should include it. The function requires all parameters. So I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No other parameters are needed. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters here.

The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. The default region is already set to US, so maybe I don't need to specify it. But since the user specified the region, I should include it. \n\nAnother function is video_games.on_sale, which checks if the game is on sale. But the user is asking for the price, not if it's on sale. So store_price is the right function here. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. The game title is given, platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So the function call should be store_price with those parameters. No other functions are needed here. The user didn't mention anything about being on sale, so store_price is the correct choice."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going. They mentioned it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant kinematic equations. Since the object starts from rest, initial speed is 0. The formula for speed when starting from rest is v = u + at, where u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. But wait, maybe they want the final speed instead. Alternatively, since they provided distance and time, maybe they can use the equation that relates distance, acceleration, and time. Let me check the functions available.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. But since the object starts from rest, initial_speed should be 0. The other function is calculate_acceleration, which requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But the user didn't mention final speed, just the distance and time. So maybe they want to find the final speed using the given parameters.\n\nWait, the user says \"how fast an object was going\" after starting from rest. So the answer would be the final speed. But how to get that using the given data. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. Using the equation v = u + at, but since u is 0, v = a*t. Also, another equation is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Since s is 20, t is 4, so 20 = 0.5*a*(4)^2 \u2192 20 = 0.5*16*a \u2192 20 = 8a \u2192 a = 2.5 m/s\u00b2. Then final speed v = a*t = 2.5*4 = 10 m/s. \n\nBut the user provided the functions. The calculate_speed_from_rest function requires distance, time, and initial_speed. Since initial_speed is 0, and distance is 20, time is 4, then the function would calculate the speed. Let me check the parameters. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). So yes, using that function with distance 20, time 4, initial_speed 0 would give the correct speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects using the acceleration function. But since they provided the distance and time, and the initial speed is 0, the calculate_speed_from_rest function is the right choice. So the correct function call would be to use calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}
