The parameters required are initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, default is 2, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless they want a different decimal place.

The user specified the game title, platform, and region, so all required parameters are provided. \n\nI need to call the store_price function with the game_title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as 'PlayStation', and region as 'United States'. The default region is already United States, but since the user specified it, including it explicitly is better. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for store_price require game_title, platform, and region (with default). Since the user mentioned the region, I should include that. So the function call should have all three parameters. \n\nI don't need to check if it's on sale because the store_price function should return the current price, whether it's on sale or not.

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are kinematic equations. The user mentioned starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. They gave distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed, I think. Or maybe acceleration first? Wait, the question is asking for how fast it was going, which is the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions. There's calculate_acceleration, which needs initial and final speed and time, or distance. But here, we don't know the acceleration or the final speed. The other function is calculate_speed_from_rest, which seems relevant because it starts from rest. Let me check its parameters: distance, time, initial_speed (default 0). Since initial speed is 0 here, maybe this function can calculate the final speed directly. \n\nWait, the function calculate_speed_from_rest's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. So using distance and time, with initial speed 0, it should give the final speed. So I can call that function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is already default 0, so no need to specify. That should work. Let me make sure the parameters are integers. The user gave 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. So the function call would be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should return the final speed. I think that's the right approach."}

Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function. I don't need to calculate mass here because the problem doesn't mention molar mass or require mass calculation. The answer should be the weighted average temperature based on the moles.

The function requires desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The default for n_rolls is 1, but wait, here we're rolling two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. Oh, wait, no, maybe n_rolls is the number of times you roll the dice, but in this case, each die is rolled once. Wait, maybe the function is designed such that each roll is a single die. Wait, the description says \"number of dice to be rolled\". Oh right, so if you have two dice, n_rolls is 2. And sides_per_die is 6 by default, but the user didn't specify any different, so we can leave that as 6.\n\nSo the desired_sum is 7. The number of dice is 2. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2. The sides_per_die can be omitted since it's default 6. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7 and n_rolls=2. Let me make sure. For two six-sided dice, the possible combinations that sum to 7 are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), which is 6 outcomes. Total possible outcomes are 6*6=36. So probability is 6/36 = 1/6. The function should calculate that. So the correct function call is to use dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2. No need to specify sides_per_die since it's 6 by default. So the tool call would be the dice_roll_probability function with those parameters."}

The user wants to find the top-rated modern sculpture exhibition in New York for the upcoming month.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions are card_game_probability.calculate, find_exhibition, and get_sculpture_info. \n\nThe find_exhibition function seems relevant here because it's about locating exhibitions based on criteria like location, art form, time, and user ratings. The user mentioned \"top rated,\" which relates to user ratings, and specified the location as New York and the art form as modern sculpture. The month is upcoming, so maybe the default value for the month parameter can be used. \n\nSo, I should call find_exhibition with location set to \"New York\", art_form as \"modern sculpture\", month as the default (upcoming), and user_ratings set to \"high\" as the default. Wait, the user said \"top rated,\" so maybe setting user_ratings to a higher threshold like 'high' makes sense. The parameters for find_exhibition include location, art_form, month, and user_ratings. The default for month is upcoming, and user_ratings default is 'high', which aligns with the user's request. \n\nTherefore, the function call should include location: \"New York\", art_form: \"sculpture\" (since the function's example uses \"sculpture\"), month: default (so maybe omit it or set to empty?), but the user specified \"upcoming month\". Wait, the function's month parameter's default is \"upcoming events\". So maybe just setting location and art_form is enough. Wait, the user says \"modern sculpture\". The art_form parameter example is \"sculpture\", so maybe just \"sculpture\" is sufficient. But the user specified \"modern\", which might need to be included. However, the function's parameters don't mention a way to specify the era or style beyond art_form. Hmm. Maybe the art_form can take \"modern sculpture\" as a string. Let me check the function definition again. The art_form parameter is described as \"The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" So the example is \"sculpture\", but the user is asking for \"modern sculpture\". Maybe the function allows more specific input. So perhaps setting art_form to \"modern sculpture\" would work. Alternatively, maybe the function expects just \"sculpture\" and other criteria. But since the user is asking for modern, perhaps including that in the art_form parameter is the best approach. \n\nSo, the parameters would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"modern sculpture\", month: default (upcoming), and user_ratings: \"high\" (default). Therefore, the function call would be find_exhibition with those parameters. \n\nI don't think get_sculpture_info is needed here because that's for retrieving specific artist's artwork, which the user didn't mention. The card probability function is unrelated. \n\nSo the correct function call is find_exhibition with location New York, art_form modern sculpture, and user_ratings high. The month can be omitted since the default is upcoming. So the final tool call should be:\n\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\"><param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York</param><param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">modern sculpture</param><param name=\"user_ratings\" type=\"string\">high</param></function>"}
