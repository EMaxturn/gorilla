The unit is metric, which is the default, so maybe I can omit it. Then same for Beijing, \"Beijing, China\" or \"Beijing, CN\". \n\nI should make two separate function calls.

The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. Since the user didn't specify the destination, the default is '.' (current directory), and recursive is False by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name. But the user hasn't specified the directory name yet. Wait, the clone_repo might have created a directory, but the user's repo is named nodejs-welcome. So maybe the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome'? The function's argument is directory_name, which should be a valid path relative to the root. So I'll use that as the directory_name parameter.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory name and other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. Again, the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome' as per the repo's name. The default values for some parameters like image_name are 'latest', which might be acceptable unless specified otherwise. The user didn't mention specific values for replicas, port, etc., so I'll use defaults unless told otherwise.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name and commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user hasn't specified commit message or branch, so I'll use defaults: commit_message 'Update changes', branch_name 'main', force_push False.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is the same as pushing all changes. So the push_git_changes_to_github function is the right one here.\n\nNow, I need to make sure all functions are called in order. Let me check if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' as well. For push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is the same as the repo's directory. The commit message and branch are default.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination as default.\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message default, branch_name default, force_push default.\n\nI need to make sure that the functions are called in the order specified in the steps. The user's steps mention steps 1-4, so each function call corresponds to each step. However, the functions might not be called in the same order as the steps, but the user's instructions say to do all the steps using the functions provided. So each step's function call is necessary.\n\nWait, the user's steps are:\n\n1. clone the repo\n2. analyse the contents and create dockerfile and kubernetes yamls\n3. add all changed files to git\n4. commit / push\n\nSo the functions for steps 2.1 and 2.2 are create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file. Then step 3 is push_git_changes_to_github. So the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nEach with their respective parameters. The parameters for create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file need the directory_name, which is 'nodejs-welcome' as per the repo's name. The other parameters for the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs use defaults where applicable.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I need to format the function calls correctly in the specified XML structure."}

The user is encountering a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They need help finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also getting the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions are applicable here. The user mentioned Java, but the available functions are all Python-based. Wait, the functions provided are for Python, but the user is working on a Java project. Hmm, that's a bit of a mismatch. The functions like get_relevant_classes are for searching classes in a repository, but the user is dealing with Java. However, the functions are in Python, so maybe the user is using a tool that allows these functions to be called regardless of the language. Or perhaps the functions are meant to be used in a context where the language isn't a barrier.\n\nAssuming that the functions can be used as is, even though they're for Python, let's proceed. The user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. So the get_relevant_classes function seems appropriate here. The parameters are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search_string would be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories is True.\n\nNext, the user needs the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters are class_name, method_name, and include_private. For 'setCellValue', the class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue', and include_private is False (default). Similarly for 'getCellValue'.\n\nSo, the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', case_sensitive=False, include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with method_name 'setCellValue' and include_private=False.\n3. get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with method_name 'getCellValue' and include_private=False.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function definitions.

The value 5 cm would be 5.0, so the function call should be get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location parameter. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\", but I need to check if that's the correct format.
