The node has ID 12 in pod 10 of the Network1 fabric, and the IP is 192.120.45.67.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is requests.get, which sends a GET request to a URL with parameters. The URL should be the base path without query parameters, and the params are a dictionary.\n\nThe URL example given in the function is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So I need to replace {ip} with the provided IP address, 192.120.45.67. That makes the URL 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nNext, the parameters. The user specified node ID 12, pod 10, and Network1 fabric. The function's params are a dict. I need to figure out the correct parameter names. Since the example isn't provided, but typical API parameters might include 'nodeId', 'podId', 'fabricName', or similar. However, the user's question mentions \"Ethernet interface statistics,\" so maybe the interface type is also needed. But the function's parameters are not specified beyond being a dict, so I have to make an educated guess based on the user's input.\n\nAssuming the API expects parameters like 'nodeId', 'podId', and 'fabric', I'll structure the params accordingly. The user provided node ID 12, pod 10, and fabric Network1. So the params would be {'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'fabric': 'Network1'}.\n\nWait, but the user also mentioned \"Ethernet interface statistics.\" Maybe there's an additional parameter to specify the interface type, like 'interfaceType': 'Ethernet'. However, since the function's parameters aren't explicitly defined, I have to rely on the user's input. The original question doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's not needed. Alternatively, maybe the endpoint already implies interface info, so the parameters are just to filter by node, pod, and fabric.\n\nSo the final function call would be requests.get with the URL constructed with the IP and the parameters including nodeId, podId, and fabric.

Maybe the correct path is something like '/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'? The user's API name is \"get information of an interface\", so maybe that's the right endpoint.\n\nNext, the parameters. The user provided fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType.
