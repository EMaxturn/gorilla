The user is asking for an Uber 'Plus' ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and can wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. The first one, uber.ride, requires loc, type, and time. The parameters for loc need to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format. The user provided exactly that: '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA'. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. The time is 10 minutes, which matches the required parameter. \n\nThe second function, uber.ride2, also has loc and type, but the loc format is 'City, State' like 'Berkeley, CA'. However, the user's address includes the street, so maybe that's not suitable. Also, uber.ride2's time has a default of 10, but the user specified 10, so maybe it's okay. But the description says uber.ride2 is for finding weather, which doesn't make sense. Wait, the description might be a mistake. Wait, the description for uber.ride2 says 'T\u00ecm th\u1eddi ti\u1ebft \u1edf \u0111\u1ecba \u0111i\u1ec3m' which translates to 'Find the weather at the location'. That seems unrelated to Uber rides. Maybe that's a typo or error in the function description. But assuming the functions are correct, uber.ride is for finding a ride, and uber.ride2 is for weather. But the user is asking for a ride, so uber.ride is the correct one. \n\nSo, using uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. The parameters match exactly. So the correct function call is uber.ride with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's HNA_WQA.search which is for retrieving up-to-date info via web search. The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user specified the keyword as '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format as text, and max_results as 10. The language wasn't mentioned, but the default is EN. Since the user is asking for information in Korean, maybe they want the results in Korean. Wait, the function's language parameter defaults to EN, but the user might prefer Korean. However, the enum for language includes EN, ES, FR, DE. Korean isn't listed. So maybe the function can't handle Korean. But the user might still want to proceed with the default EN. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept other languages, but according to the parameters, it's limited to those. So I should use the default EN unless specified. But the user's query is in Korean, so perhaps they want the results in Korean. However, the function's language options don't include Korean. Hmm. The user might not care about the language and just wants the keyword search. Since the function's default is EN, maybe proceed with that. The parameters required are keyword, and others are optional. So the function call would be HNA_WQA.search with keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format 'text', max_results 10.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir's birthday. Since the user mentioned using recall memory, I should check the conversation history. The function 'recall_memory_search' can help here. I'll query for \"Shishir Patil birthday\".\n\nOnce I get the birthday info, I can compose a message. But wait, the user might not have provided it yet. If the search doesn't return the info, I might need to ask the user. However, the current functions don't include a way to ask the user directly. Hmm, maybe the birthday is in the core memory's human sub-block. Let me check that too. If not, I can't proceed without that data. \n\nAssuming the birthday is found, I'll use 'send_message' to send the congrats. But the user's instruction says to send a message, so I need to make sure the parameters are correct. The recipient should be Shishir's contact info, which might be in the human sub-block. If not, I need to default or ask. \n\nWait, the functions don't have a way to retrieve contact info unless it's in the core memory. So if the birthday is in the core memory, great. Otherwise, I can't send the message. The user might have provided this info earlier, but since I can't access past interactions beyond the recall memory, I need to use the search function. \n\nSo first step: search recall memory for Shishir's birthday. If found, proceed. If not, maybe the core memory has it. But the core memory's human sub-block is for user details. If the user hasn't provided that info, I can't send the message. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to generate a message without the birthday, but the question specifically asks for the birthday and a message. So I need both. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first search the recall memory for the birthday. If found, use that. If not, inform the user. But since the functions don't allow for asking the user, maybe the birthday is in the core memory. \n\nWait, the core memory's human sub-block stores key details about the user. If Shishir is the user, then his birthday would be there. But the user's name is Shishir Patil, so maybe the human sub-block has that info. \n\nBut how to check? The core_memory_search isn't a function, but the core memory is always visible. However, the user hasn't provided that info yet. So perhaps the birthday isn't available, and I need to ask the user. But the functions don't allow that. \n\nThis is a problem. Without the birthday, I can't send the message. So maybe the user expects me to use the archival memory? But the archival memory requires inserting data first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the birthday isn't available. In that case, I should inform them. But the functions don't have a way to respond to the user except via send_message. \n\nWait, the user's question is to \"send a contraguation message to him.\" So maybe the birthday is known, and the user is testing if I can retrieve it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the birthday is in the core memory's human sub-block. Let me assume that. If not, the message can't be sent. \n\nSo, first, check recall memory for \"Shishir Patil birthday\". If found, proceed. If not, check core memory. If not found, inform the user. But since I can't ask, maybe the answer is that the birthday isn't available. \n\nBut the user might have provided the birthday in a previous message. Since the functions allow searching recall memory, I should use that. \n\nSo, the first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir Patil birthday\". If that returns the birthday, then use send_message with the message. If not, then maybe the core memory has it. But without knowing, I can't proceed. \n\nTherefore, the first step is to search the recall memory. If that fails, then the answer is that the birthday isn't available. But the user might expect the message to be sent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing the functions, and the birthday is in the core memory. But without knowing, I have to proceed with the available functions. \n\nSo, the correct function calls would be to first search the recall memory for the birthday, then send the message if found. If not, then no message can be sent. \n\nBut the user's question is to send the message, so perhaps the birthday is known. Let me proceed with the search."}

The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summaries. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user mentioned the account type is \"business checking,\" so account_type should be 'checking'. The bank name is U.S. Bank, account number is given, full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview needs total deposits, total withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. They provided those values: deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40, start_date 2019-10-01, end_date 2019-10-31. Also, the beginning and ending balances are provided, but the function's transaction_overview doesn't include balances. Maybe the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview property includes those totals, so I can structure that.\n\nWait, looking at the parameters for BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview, it requires total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided those. So I can fill those in. The function also requires the other parameters like bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name. \n\nSo I should call BankStatementOverView with those details. Also, the user wants a summary of transactions, which might be covered by the transaction_overview in the function. Additionally, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function could be used, but the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, only totals. Since the question mentions including a summary, perhaps the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, if the transaction_summary.generate requires individual transactions, but the user hasn't provided them, maybe that's not possible. But the user provided totals, so maybe the BankStatementOverView is the right choice. Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these. So I can use that function. \n\nSo the function call would be BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. Let me structure the JSON accordingly."}

The user mentioned Noida as the city, so that's covered. They didn't specify a cinema hall, so I can leave that as the default. The date is \"today,\" so I need to calculate today's date in India.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants which searches based on location, category, and other preferences. The parameters include location, category, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. \n\nThe user specified \"intermediate priced\" which maps to the price_range parameter. The enum for price_range includes 'moderate', which is likely the equivalent of intermediate. So I should set price_range to 'moderate'. \n\nThey also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be set to True. The location is New York, but the format requires 'City, State'. Since the user just said New York, I'll assume 'New York, NY' as the location. \n\nThe category isn't specified, so maybe the function allows it, but the required parameters are category and location. Wait, the required parameters are category and location. The user didn't mention a specific cuisine category. Hmm, but the function requires category. Maybe the user didn't specify, so perhaps I need to check if the function allows a default or if it's mandatory. Looking back, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have category as required, with an enum list. Since the user didn't specify a category, maybe the function can't be called without it. Wait, but the user's query doesn't mention a category. Wait, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating in New York. They didn't specify a cuisine type. But the function requires the category parameter. So maybe the user's query is missing that parameter. However, perhaps the function allows for a default category? Let me check the parameters again. The category is required, and there's no default mentioned. So the user's query is missing the category. But the user might not have specified it. Wait, the user's question says \"some restaurants\" without specifying cuisine. So maybe the function can't be called as is. But the user might be okay with any category. Wait, but the function requires category. So perhaps the user's query is incomplete. However, maybe the assistant can proceed by using a default or a general category. Wait, the parameters for the function don't have a default for category. So the function can't be called without it. But the user hasn't provided it. So this is a problem. However, maybe the user intended to leave it open, but the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant should point out that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. However, the user's question is to find restaurants in New York with intermediate price and outdoor seating.

But the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. Wait, but the user might have intended to leave the category open. However, the function requires category. So this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a wildcard or a general category. But according to the function's parameters, category is required and has an enum list. So the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the correct response would be to point out that the category is missing. However, the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. But in this case, the required parameter is missing. So the assistant should mention that. But the user's instruction says if the question lacks parameters, point it out. So the answer would be to indicate that the category is missing. However, the user's original question might have intended to include category, but it's not there. So the assistant should respond that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says to return function calls if possible. So perhaps the assistant can't call the function and must point out the missing parameter. However, the user's instruction says to make one or more function calls.

The user wants to book a hotel for studio sessions, starting on the 15th of July and staying for 5 days. First, I need to figure out the check-in date and the length of stay. The user mentioned \"book on the 15th of July\" which I think means check-in is July 15th. Staying for 5 days would mean the stay_length is 5. \n\nLooking at the functions available, the Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function requires place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location, and number_of_rooms. The user didn't specify the location or the hotel name, so I might need to ask for those. But wait, the user might have mentioned the location earlier? Let me check the query again. The user says \"go to the studio sessions\" but doesn't specify the city. Hmm, maybe the location is implied? Or perhaps the user expects me to use the Hotels_4_SearchHotel first to find available hotels. \n\nWait, the user's message is a bit unclear. They mention booking on the 15th of July and staying for 5 days. But they didn't specify the location. The Hotels_4_ReserveHotel function requires location as a mandatory parameter. Since the user hasn't provided the location, I can't proceed with the reservation. So I need to ask for the location. Alternatively, maybe the studio sessions are in a specific place, but the user didn't mention it. \n\nWait, the user might have mentioned the location in a previous conversation? But in the current context, there's no prior message. So I need to request the location. However, the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. Since the location is missing, I can't call Hotels_4_ReserveHotel. So the correct step is to point out that the location is missing. But the user might have intended to provide the location in the query. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Wait, maybe there's a typo here. The user might have meant \"book on the 15th of July, staying for 5 days?\" So the check-in date is July 15th, stay_length is 5. But location is missing. \n\nTherefore, the function Hotels_4_ReserveHotel requires location, which is not provided. So I need to inform the user that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the location but made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the studio sessions are in a known location. But without that info, I can't proceed. So the correct response is to point out that the location is missing. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. So the answer would be that the location is required but not provided. \n\nWait, but the user might have mentioned the location in the question. Let me check again. The original question is: \"I know I can count on you to help me find a hotel so I can go to the studio sessions. book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" The user mentions \"studio sessions\" but doesn't specify the city. So the location is missing. Therefore, the function call can't be made. So the correct response is to indicate that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the location but forgot. In that case, the assistant should ask for the location. But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, point it out. So the answer would be that the location is required but not provided. \n\nBut the user's message might have a typo. The \"2staying\" could be a typo for \"staying\". So the user is saying they want to book on July 15th and stay for 5 days. But still, the location is missing. Therefore, the function call can't be made. So the correct response is to point out that the location is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the location in the query. But based on the given information, the location is not provided. Therefore, the answer is that the location is required but not given."}

Wait, but FindMovies is for searching movies based on location, genre, and show type. The user specified \"Imax\" which is a show type. The location is Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville. But the parameters for FindMovies include location, theater_name, genre, and show_type. The location should be in 'City, State' format. Danville is a city, but the state isn't mentioned. Maybe the user assumes it's in California? Or maybe the function can handle it without the state? Wait, the parameters say state must be abbreviated. So maybe the user needs to specify the state. But the user only said Danville. Hmm, maybe the function can still work with just the city, but it's better to clarify. However, since the user hasn't provided the state, perhaps I should proceed with the given info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the theater name is Century Blackhawk Plaza, so using that as the theater_name parameter. The show_type is Imax. So the function call would be to Movies_1_FindMovies with location as Danville, theater_name as Century Blackhawk Plaza, show_type as imax.

So the user's query includes the theater name, so we should include that. The location is Danville, but the state is missing. The user might be in California, but without knowing, maybe the function can still process it. Alternatively, maybe the function expects the full 'City, State' format. Since the user didn't specify the state, perhaps the function can't proceed. But the user might have intended Danville, CA. Maybe I should assume that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's input is incomplete. But since the user hasn't provided the state, perhaps the function can't be called properly.

That should retrieve the movies showing at that theater with Imax format. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the movie titles, so using FindMovies makes sense.

The album parameter should be set to 'The New Classic' to find similar songs. But wait, the function's parameters for album have a default of 'dontcare', but the user specifically mentioned the album, so I should set that. However, looking at the function's parameters, the 'album' parameter in LookupMusic is for the album the song is part of. Wait, the user wants songs similar to that album, so maybe the LookupMusic function can take the album name as a parameter to find similar tracks. But the function's description says it finds songs based on artist, album, genre, etc. So if I set the album parameter to 'The New Classic', it might find songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, not necessarily from the same album. Hmm, maybe the function can handle that. Alternatively, maybe the function uses the album to find similar tracks. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the parameters again. The Music_3_LookupMusic function's parameters include artist, album, genre, year. The user wants songs similar to the album, so perhaps setting the album parameter to 'The New Classic' would help. But the function's description says it finds songs based on those criteria. Maybe the album parameter is for the album the song is part of, not similar albums. Wait, the user wants similar songs to the album, so maybe the function isn't the right one. But given the available functions, LookupMusic is the only one that can search for songs. Maybe the function can take the album name and find similar tracks. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to look for songs from the same album, but the user said \"similar to those on the album,\" which implies similar tracks, not the same album. But the function might not support that. Alternatively, maybe the function can use the album parameter to find songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, not the same album. Hmm. Maybe the function isn't designed for that. But given the available functions, I have to use LookupMusic. So perhaps the user wants to look for songs from the album 'The New Classic' and also tracks from 2017. Wait, the user says \"tracks released around six years ago. This year is 2023.\" So six years ago would be 2017. So the year parameter should be 2017. But the LookupMusic function's year parameter has an enum that includes 2017. So I can set the year to 2017. But the user also wants songs similar to the album 'The New Classic'. How to handle that? The LookupMusic function's album parameter is for the album the song is part of. If the user wants similar songs, maybe the function isn't the right one. But since that's the only function available, perhaps the user is looking for songs from the same album, but the query says \"similar to those on the album,\" which might not be possible with this function. Alternatively, maybe the function can take the album name and find similar tracks. But the parameters don't mention that. Maybe the function is designed to find songs based on the given criteria, so if the user provides the album, it might return songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, not the same album. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the available functions, I'll proceed with using LookupMusic with the album parameter set to 'The New Classic' and the year set to 2017. Wait, but the user wants songs similar to the album and tracks from 2017. So maybe two separate calls? Or one call with both album and year. Let me check the parameters again. The LookupMusic function allows specifying album and year. So if I set album to 'The New Classic' and year to 2017, it would find songs from that album released in 2017. But the user wants similar songs to the album and tracks from 2017. Maybe the user wants two separate sets: one for songs similar to the album (which might require different parameters) and another for tracks from 2017. But the function might not support that. Alternatively, maybe the user wants songs that are similar in genre or other criteria. But the user didn't specify genre. So perhaps the best approach is to use LookupMusic with the album parameter set to 'The New Classic' and the year set to 2017. However, the album parameter in LookupMusic is for the album the song is part of, not similar albums. So maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the function can take the album name and find similar tracks. But the function's description doesn't mention that. This is a bit of a problem. Given the available functions, perhaps the user's request can't be fully met, but I'll proceed with the best possible approach. So, the first call would be to Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. But wait, the user wants tracks released around six years ago, which is 2017, so the year parameter should be 2017. But the album parameter is for the album the song is part of. So if the user wants songs similar to the album, maybe the function isn't the right one. However, given the available functions, I'll proceed with that. So the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. But the user might need to adjust the parameters. Alternatively, maybe the album parameter is not needed, and the year is 2017. But the user mentioned the album, so including it. So the parameters would be album='The New Classic', year='2017'. But the function's parameters for album have a default of 'dontcare', so setting it to the album name. The year is set to 2017. So the function call would be:\n\n[{\"function\": \"Music_3_LookupMusic\", \"parameters\": {\"album\": \"The New Classic\", \"year\": \"2017\"}}]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to look for songs similar to the album's genre or other criteria. But without knowing the genre, it's hard to say. So the best possible call is to use the album and year parameters as specified."}

The genre parameter has an enum list, and \"Comedy\" is one of the options. Since \"comic\" is likely referring to comedy movies, I can use the Comedy genre. The starring parameter defaults to 'Any' if not specified, so I don't need to include that unless the user specifies an actor. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention any specific actor, so I can leave starring as 'Any'. Therefore, the function call should be Media_3_FindMovies with genre set to Comedy. That should retrieve a list of comedy movies online. I don't think the other functions are relevant here since they deal with music or travel. So the correct function call is Media_3_FindMovies with genre: Comedy."}

The user mentioned Hillbilly style, which might correspond to the genre parameter. However, looking at the genre enum in the function, Hillbilly isn't listed. The options are Reggae, Holiday, Electropop, Pop, Asia, House, Electronica, Funk, Rock, Metal, Dubstep, Country, and dontcare. Wait, Country is an option. Maybe Hillbilly is a subset of Country? The user might mean Country music. Alternatively, since Hillbilly isn't listed, perhaps the function doesn't support it. But the user specified the album \"Gotta Be Me,\" so maybe that's a specific album. \n\nThe user also mentioned the album, so I should use the Music_3_LookupMusic function with album set to \"Gotta Be Me\" and genre as \"Country\" (since Hillbilly might be considered Country). The year is 2019. Let me check the parameters. The genre parameter's enum includes 'dontcare' and the listed genres. Since Hillbilly isn't there, maybe the user meant Country. Alternatively, if the function doesn't support Hillbilly, maybe the genre should be set to 'dontcare' and rely on the album. But the user specified the genre as Hillbilly, so I need to map that to the closest available genre. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant Country. Let me proceed with genre as 'Country' and album as 'Gotta Be Me', year 2019. Then, after getting the list of songs, use Music_3_PlayMedia to play one of them.

Then, if there are tracks, use PlayMedia with the track name. But the user hasn't specified a track, so maybe the LookupMusic will return the tracks, and then the PlayMedia can be called with one of them. However, the user's initial request is to play a song, so maybe the LookupMusic is needed to find the tracks, then PlayMedia. \n\nBut the user might not have provided the track name, so the LookupMusic is necessary. So the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. Then, once the tracks are found, use PlayMedia. But since the user hasn't specified a track, maybe the LookupMusic will return the tracks, and then the PlayMedia can be called with the first track. However, the user's message doesn't mention a specific track, so the assistant needs to find the tracks first. \n\nTherefore, the first function call should be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Country' (assuming Hillbilly is a typo or subset of Country), year='2019'. Then, after getting the list, play one of the tracks. But since the user wants to play a song, the assistant might need to call PlayMedia once the track is known. However, the user hasn't provided the track name, so the LookupMusic is necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the album \"Gotta Be Me\" by a specific artist, but the artist isn't mentioned. So the LookupMusic function can be called with album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Country', year='2019', and artist='dontcare'. Then, the function will return the tracks, and then PlayMedia can be used. \n\nSo the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters album='Gotta Be Me', genre='Country', year='2019'. Then, once the tracks are found, use PlayMedia with the track name. But since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant might need to call PlayMedia with the track name obtained from LookupMusic. However, the user's initial request is to play a song, so the assistant should first find the tracks and then play one. \n\nBut the user might not have provided the track name, so the assistant needs to use LookupMusic to find the tracks. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. Then, the next step would be to call PlayMedia with the track name from the lookup result.

Assuming today's date is October 10, 2023, this Friday would be October 13, 2023. But since the current date isn't given, maybe the system can handle relative dates. However, the function requires a specific date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. So I need to figure out the actual date based on the current date. Wait, but the user might not have provided the current date. Hmm, but the function requires the date, so I have to calculate it. Let's assume today is the day of the query, and \"this Friday\" is the upcoming Friday. Let's say the current date is October 5, 2023, then this Friday would be October 12. But without knowing the actual current date, maybe the function can handle relative dates? Or perhaps the user expects the system to compute it. However, since the function requires a specific date, I need to determine it. Alternatively, maybe the user's message implies that the date is already known, so the assistant should calculate it. But since I don't have real-time data, perhaps the function can accept a relative date? Wait, the parameters specify the date as ISO format, so it's a specific date. Therefore, the user's message needs to include the exact date. But the user said \"this Friday,\" which is relative. So maybe the assistant should first find out the date.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the system to handle it. But since the function requires the date, and the user hasn't provided it, maybe the assistant should point out that the date is missing. Wait, but the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a specific day of the week. So the assistant needs to convert that into the actual date.

Therefore, the assistant should point out that the date is missing. But the user might have expected the system to handle it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using the relative date as a string, but the function requires ISO format. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the date is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday,\" which is a specific day. Therefore, the assistant needs to calculate the date. But without real-time data, the assistant can't. Therefore, the function call can't be made.

The RequestPayment function is for initiating a payment request, maybe like asking someone for money, while MakePayment is actually sending the money. The user is asking to send $90 to Alice using a debit card, so MakePayment seems more appropriate here.\n\nNow, checking the parameters for Payment_1_MakePayment. The required parameters are payment_method, amount, and receiver. The payment_method can be 'app balance', 'debit card', or 'credit card'. The user specified using a debit card, so that's set. The amount is $90, which is a float. The receiver is Alice. \n\nAlso, there's an optional parameter private_visibility, which defaults to False.

Maybe they mean the journey starts on May 15th, but the start time is one day before the date? That doesn't make sense.

Or maybe they meant the date is May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date? That's confusing. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe user says: \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14th, but the date_of_journey is May 15th? That doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo, and they meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date? That's not possible. Maybe the user intended the journey date to be May 15th, and the start time is at a specific time, but the \"one day before\" refers to something else. Wait, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which would be May 14th. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in phrasing and meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is at a certain time. Since the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is in 24-hour format, perhaps the user intended the start time to be on May 15th, but the \"one day before\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which would be May 14th. But that would make the date_of_journey May 15th, and the start time on May 14th, which is conflicting. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, given the parameters, the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, and journey_start_time is the time on that date. So if the user says the journey is on May 15, 2023, starting at one day before, perhaps they meant the start time is on May 14th, but that would require the date_of_journey to be May 14th. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the journey date to be May 15th, and the start time is at a specific time, but the \"one day before\" is a mistake. Since the user is asking to book tickets for the journey on May 15, 2023, starting at one day before, perhaps the actual start time is on May 14th, but that would require the date_of_journey to be May 14th. However, the user explicitly says the journey is on May 15th. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is at a specific time, but the \"one day before\" refers to the date being one day before another date. Since the user's question is unclear, but the function requires the date_of_journey and journey_start_time, I'll proceed with the information given. \n\nAssuming that the journey is on May 15, 2023, and the start time is at a specific time, but the user mentioned \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14th, but the date_of_journey is May 15th. That's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant the journey is on May 14th, but the date is written as May 15th. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but needing to proceed, I'll assume that the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is a specific time, but the user's mention of \"one day before\" might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the journey to start on May 14th, but the date_of_journey is May 15th. However, without more information, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as a time on that day. \n\nThe user also wants business class, so _class should be 'Business'. The number_of_adults is 4, and trip_protection is True. \n\nSo the parameters would be: _from: Portland, OR; to: Seattle, WA; date_of_journey: 2023-05-15; journey_start_time: need to determine. The user said \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe the journey starts on May 14th, but the date_of_journey is May 15th. That's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15th, and the start time is at 12:00 AM (midnight), which is technically one day before the date. But that's a stretch. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended the journey date to be May 15th, and the start time is a specific time, but the mention of \"one day before\" is a mistake. Therefore, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as 2023-05-15 and a journey_start_time, say, 08:00 (assuming the user meant a specific time). However, since the user didn't specify the exact time, but mentioned \"starting at one day before\", perhaps the journey_start_time is on May 14th. But that would require the date_of_journey to be May 14th. \n\nThis is a problem. The user's instruction is unclear. However, given the parameters, the date_of_journey is required, and the journey_start_time is also required. Since the user says the journey is on May 15, 2023, starting at one day before, perhaps the journey_start_time is on May 14th, but that would make the date_of_journey May 14th. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15th, and the start time is one day before the date, which is not possible. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user intended the journey date to be May 15th, and the start time is a specific time, but the \"one day before\" is a mistake. Therefore, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as 2023-05-15 and a journey_start_time of, say, 08:00. However, since the user didn't specify the exact time, but the function requires it, I need to include it. \n\nBut the user's question doesn't provide the journey_start_time. Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14th, but the date_of_journey is May 15th. That's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant the journey is on May 14th, but wrote May 15th. \n\nIn this case, since the user's instruction is unclear, but the function requires the journey_start_time, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's assume that the journey is on May 15th, and the start time is at 08:00. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\n_from: \"Portland, OR\"\n\nto: \"Seattle, WA\"\n\ndate_of_journey: \"2023-05-15\"\n\njourney_start_time: \"08:00\"\n\nnumber_of_adults: 4\n\ntrip_protection: True\n\n_class: \"Business\"\n\nBut the user mentioned \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe the journey starts on May 14th, so date_of_journey is \"2023-05-14\" and journey_start_time is \"08:00\". However, the user said the journey is on May 15th. \n\nThis is a conflict. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended the journey date to be May 15th, and the start time is at a specific time, but the \"one day before\" is a mistake. Therefore, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as 2023-05-15 and a journey_start_time of \"08:00\". \n\nThus, the function call would be to Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with those parameters."}

Since the user wants actively configured websites, setting status_filter to 'active' makes sense. Also, the include_metadata parameter defaults to False, but maybe the user wants metadata like creation dates. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe just use the default. But since the question is about configured websites, perhaps the metadata isn't needed. Wait, the parameters are optional, so if we don't include include_metadata, it's False by default. So calling get_websites with status_filter='active' should return all active websites. \n\nAnother function is website_configuration_api.WebsiteConfigurationApi.get_website, but that requires a websiteId, which the user hasn't provided.

Then there's the 'get_shareable_api_tokens' from CustomDashboardsApi, which also needs a user_id and include_expired. The user mentioned they forgot their tokens, so they probably need all tokens associated with their account, including any expired ones. \n\nWait, the default for include_expired is False in both functions.

So I need to call both functions? Wait, no. Let me check the descriptions again. The first function retrieves API tokens associated with the user's account, and the second retrieves shareable API tokens for custom dashboards. The user might need both types. However, the user's question is general\u2014remind them of all API tokens. So maybe both functions are needed. \n\nWait, but the user might have tokens from both sources. So to get all tokens, I should call both functions with the user_id and include_expired set to True. But the user's ID is given as a string \"user123\". However, in the 'post_api_token' function, the user_id is an integer. But in the get functions, the user_id is a string.

The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the alert type is error rate with a threshold of 5%, and notifications need to go to two email addresses.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application alert,\" the create_global_application_alert_config function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for that function: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The name is provided. The alert_type should be 'error_rate' as per the enum. The threshold is 5%, which is a float, so 5.0. Recipients are the two emails given. The enabled parameter is optional with a default of True, so maybe we can include it or leave it out. But the user didn't specify enabling or disabling, so maybe just use the default. \n\nWait, the function's required parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. All of these are provided. The user didn't mention the enabled flag, so we can omit it or set it to the default. Since the default is True, it's safe to include it. But the parameters section in the function shows that enabled is optional. So the function call should include all required parameters. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\nname: 'UrgentAlert77f7'\nalert_type: 'error_rate'\nthreshold: 5.0\nrecipients: ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']\nenabled: True (default, but maybe include it explicitly)\n\nWait, the function's parameters have enabled as a property with default True. Since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to include it to be explicit. But the required fields don't include enabled, so it's optional. However, the user wants to set up the alert, which implies it should be enabled. So including enabled: True makes sense.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The other functions aren't needed here. The enable function is for activating an existing config, which isn't needed here since we're creating a new one. The mobile app function is for mobile apps, which isn't the case here. So the correct call is the create_global_application_alert_config with the given parameters."}

Let me check the available functions. There are two functions that retrieve API tokens: CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. \n\nThe user provided their user ID, which is 12345. The first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires a user_id parameter. Since the user provided that, I can use this function. However, the description mentions it's for shareable tokens. The second function, get_api_tokens, doesn't require a user_id but has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. \n\nBut the user wants all tokens. The first function's parameters include include_revoked, which defaults to False. If they want all tokens, maybe including revoked ones, but the user didn't specify. The second function has include_expired, which defaults to False. So if they want all active tokens, maybe using get_api_tokens with include_expired set to True? Wait, but the user's ID is given. Wait, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter. That's a problem. The user provided their user ID, but the get_api_tokens function doesn't have that parameter. So maybe the first function is the right one, but it's for shareable tokens. The user might not have specified if they want shareable or all tokens. \n\nWait, the user says \"ALL API TOKENS NOW\". The get_shareable_api_tokens function is for shareable tokens, but maybe the user wants all tokens, including non-shareable. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id, so maybe it's for the current user. But the user provided their user ID, so perhaps the first function is the correct one. But the first function's parameters require user_id, which the user provided. So I should call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the user might not have mentioned revoked tokens. Alternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function is for all tokens, but without user_id. But since the user provided their user ID, maybe the first function is the way to go. \n\nWait, the user might be confused between the two functions. The get_shareable_api_tokens is for shareable tokens, while get_api_tokens might be for all tokens. But the user's user ID is needed for the first function. Since the user provided their user ID, I should use that. However, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id, so maybe it's for the current user. But the user might not be the current user. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the first function, which requires user_id. Since the user provided their user ID, I can call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens. But the user might not have specified revoked tokens. However, the user is asking for all tokens, so including revoked ones. So the function call would be get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. \n\nBut wait, the get_api_tokens function's parameters don't include user_id. So if the user is asking for all tokens, maybe that function is the right one, but without user_id. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the first function is the correct one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is not aware of the difference between the two functions. Since the user provided their user ID, the first function is the way to go. So the correct function call is get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. But the default for include_revoked is False. So to get all tokens, including revoked, set include_revoked=True. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be to get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True."}

Let me check the available functions to see which one can help.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' which retrieves detailed info on experiences and education. The parameters require specifying the type, which includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' as an option. The user specifically mentioned education, so that's the type to use. The parameters also need a name, but the default is 'Not specified'. Since the user is asking for the education at UNS, maybe the name is the university itself. \n\nWait, the 'experience_or_education_name' parameter has a default, so even if it's not provided, it might still work. But to be precise, maybe I should include the name as 'Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. However, the function's enum for experience_or_education_type already includes that exact string. So the parameters would be experience_or_education_type set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and experience_or_education_name might not be necessary unless required. Wait, the parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' have 'experience_or_education_type' as required, and 'experience_or_education_name' is optional with a default. \n\nSince the user is asking specifically about education at UNS, the type is correct. The name might not be needed if the type already specifies it, but the function might require the name. However, the default is 'Not specified', which might not be accurate. But maybe the function is designed so that when the type is set to the education option, the name is automatically filled. Alternatively, perhaps the name should be the degree or program, but the user hasn't specified that. \n\nGiven the information, the best approach is to call 'detail_experience_and_education' with the type as 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and leave the name as default. Alternatively, maybe the name is redundant here. Wait, looking back, the parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' have 'experience_or_education_name' as a property with a default of 'Not specified'. Since the user is asking for the education at UNS, perhaps the name is the university, but the function might not require it. However, the function's parameters don't have a 'university' field, so maybe the name is optional. \n\nIn any case, the function requires the type, which is provided. The name is optional, so even if it's not specified, the function might still retrieve the education details. Therefore, the correct function call would be to use 'detail_experience_and_education' with the type set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and leave the name as default. Alternatively, maybe the name should be included as the university name. But since the user hasn't provided more details, it's safer to use the default. \n\nSo the final function call would be:\n\n{\"function\": \"detail_experience_and_education\", \"parameters\": {\"experience_or_education_type\": \"Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\"}}"}

The user wants to wake up early for a meeting tomorrow, which is 2023-12-1, and they need a reminder at 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for a specific time tomorrow, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for durations like hours or minutes, not specific dates and times.\n\nLooking at the parameters for set_alarm, the required parameter is alarm_time. The user provided \"7:00 AM\" and the date \"2023-12-1\". The function's description says the time can be in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. So I should combine the date and time into one string. The date is 2023-12-1, and the time is 7:00 AM. Converting 7:00 AM to 24-hour format would be 07:00. So the alarm_time should be \"2023-12-1 07:00:00\". \n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, with a default of 'reminder'. The user mentioned a meeting, so maybe setting the purpose to 'meeting' would be more specific. But the default is already 'reminder', which is acceptable. However, the user might want to specify the purpose as 'meeting' for clarity. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for set_alarm include 'purpose' as optional, defaulting to 'reminder'. The user's request is for a meeting, so changing the purpose to 'meeting' makes sense. \n\nSo the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time \"2023-12-1 07:00:00\" and purpose \"meeting\". \n\nI need to make sure the date and time format is correct. The user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is probably a typo for \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\". Assuming the date is correct, the function should accept that. \n\nAnother thing to check: the alarm_time can be in 12-hour format with AM/PM. The user specified \"7:00 AM\", which is acceptable. But since the date is provided, combining it with the time in 24-hour format might be better. However, the function allows both formats. So \"2023-12-1 7:00 AM\" would also work. Wait, the description says the time can be in 24-hour format or 12-hour with AM/PM. So including the date and time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM' is acceptable. \n\nBut the example given in the function's parameters includes '2023-06-01 09:30:00', '14:45', '9:30 AM'. So for the date and time, the format should be 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM' or 'HH:MM AM/PM'. Therefore, combining the date and time as '2023-12-1 7:00 AM' is valid. \n\nAlternatively, using 24-hour format for the time part: '2023-12-1 07:00:00'. Either should work. The user specified \"7:00 AM\", so maybe using that format is better to match their input. \n\nSo the parameters would be alarm_time: \"2023-12-1 7:00 AM\" and purpose: \"meeting\". \n\nI think that's all. The function call should be set_alarm with those parameters."}
