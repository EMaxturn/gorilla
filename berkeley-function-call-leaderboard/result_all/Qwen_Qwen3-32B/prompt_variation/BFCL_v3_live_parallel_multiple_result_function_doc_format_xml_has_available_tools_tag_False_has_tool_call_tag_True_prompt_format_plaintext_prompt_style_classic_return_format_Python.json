The function clone_repo is perfect here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I'll use that as the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll omit it, which means it'll clone to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here unless specified, which they aren't. So the first function call is clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The function analyse_repo_contents requires the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, I'll assume the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome' as per the repo name. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create/update the Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file needs the directory_name. Again, using 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor the Kubernetes YAMLs, use create_kubernetes_yaml_file. The directory_name is the same. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., aren't provided, so I'll use the defaults. The function allows defaults if parameters are omitted. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter making these changes, add all the changed files to Git. But there's no function for adding files. Wait, the push function mentions it will automatically git add all changes. So the next step is to push the changes. The function push_git_changes_to_github requires directory_name. The commit message, branch, and force_push are optional. The user wants to commit and push, so I'll need to provide a commit message. Since the user didn't specify one, maybe use a default like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\". The branch isn't specified, so assume 'main' or 'master'. Let's go with 'main' as a default. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message=\"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\", branch_name='main'.\n\nWait, but the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is part of step 3. However, the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe I don't need a separate step for adding. So the push function handles adding, committing, and pushing. Therefore, after creating the files, calling push_git_changes_to_github with the necessary parameters should handle everything.\n\nSo the sequence is: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAML, then push. Each step requires the respective functions. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly set. The directory_name for each is 'nodejs-welcome', which is the repo name. The analysis will determine the language, but the create functions don't require that info. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file might need the image name, but since it's not provided, it defaults to 'latest' as per the function's description. So all steps should work with the given functions."}

The recall_memory_search function can search prior conversation history. So I'll use that with the query \"Shishir's birthday\". The parameters are query, page (optional), and request_heartbeat. Since the user might have mentioned it once, maybe page 0 is enough. I'll set request_heartbeat to true to get a follow-up.\n\nOnce I get the search results, if there's a match, I can extract the date. Then use send_message to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir. But wait, the send_message requires a recipient. The user didn't specify Shishir's contact info. Hmm, maybe the previous conversations have that? But the current functions don't retrieve that info. So if the search finds the birthday but not the recipient details, I can't send the message. But the user might expect that the system already knows how to reach Shishir. Alternatively, maybe the recipient can be inferred as \"Shishir\" if the system handles that. But the send_message function's recipient parameter expects a username, phone, or email. Without that info, the function can't be used. \n\nWait, the user is asking to send a message regardless. So maybe even if the recipient isn't found, just send it. But the function requires the recipient. So if the previous messages don't have Shishir's contact info, the send_message can't be called. But the user might assume that Shishir is a known contact. Alternatively, maybe the system can send the message without specifying the recipient, but the function requires it. \n\nSo first step: use recall_memory_search to find Shishir's birthday. Then, if found, use send_message with recipient as Shishir's contact. But if the contact isn't in the search results, then the send_message can't be completed. But the user wants to send it regardless. Maybe the system has Shishir's contact stored elsewhere, but the available functions don't provide that. So perhaps the user expects that the system can send the message once the birthday is confirmed, even if the recipient isn't in the search results. But according to the functions given, send_message needs the recipient parameter. So if the previous conversations don't have that, the function can't be called. \n\nSo the plan is: first, call recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\" to find the date. Then, if found, call send_message with message \"Happy Birthday!\" and recipient as Shishir's contact. But since the recipient isn't provided in the user's question, maybe the system assumes it's known. However, the function requires it. Therefore, if the previous messages don't have the recipient info, this might not work. But the user is asking to do it regardless, so perhaps proceed with the functions available, even if the recipient is missing. Alternatively, maybe the recipient is inferred as \"Shishir\" if the system can handle that. \n\nIn any case, the first step is to search for the birthday. Then, assuming the date is found, send the message. So the first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\"."}

If the module name is known, it should be included, but since it's optional and not provided, I'll omit it.\n\nNext, the user specifically asked for the signature of the 'get_weather' method in the same class. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll need to provide the class_name as 'Weather' and method_name as 'get_weather'. Again, unless specified, I don't need to include private methods, so include_private can be left out.\n\nWait, but what if the 'get_weather' method isn't present? The function will handle that by not returning it, which would explain the compilation error. But the user wants to confirm its existence. So by calling these two functions, we can first list all available methods (from get_class_info) and then check the signature (from get_signature). If get_signature doesn't return anything, that means the method isn't present, which is the root cause of the error.\n\nI should make sure that both functions are called. The parameters are correctly set, so the functions should execute. The user might need to check if the method name is correct, maybe there's a typo. Also, maybe the method exists but with a different parameter type. The signature will show the actual parameters, helping to identify the issue.\n\nSo the correct approach is to first call get_class_info for 'Weather' to see all methods, then call get_signature for 'get_weather' in 'Weather'. If the method isn't listed in the class info, then it's not present. If it is, but the signature doesn't match the call (like expecting a String but the method takes something else), that's the problem."}

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. So I need to call that function with a=48 and b=36. Wait, the parameters specify that 'a' is the first and larger integer. Since 48 is larger than 36, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the second part, the user is asking about the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. Steepness here refers to the derivative of the function at that point. The derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x, so at x=5, it should be 10. But the user might want a numerical estimation using the estimate_derivative function. The function requires the mathematical function, the point x, and optionally dx and method. Since the exact derivative is straightforward, maybe the user wants a numerical approximation. Let's use the central difference method with a small dx, like 0.0001. So I need to call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5, dx=0.0001, method='central'. \n\nWait, do I need to provide dx and method? The parameters are optional, but specifying them ensures accuracy. The default method might be forward difference, but central is more accurate. Including dx and method makes the call explicit. \n\nSo the two function calls would be math_gcd for 48 and 36, then estimate_derivative for f(x)=x\u00b2 at x=5 with central difference. Let me check the parameters again to make sure. The math_gcd requires a and b as integers, and estimate_derivative needs the function, x, dx, and method. Yes, that's correct. Alright, I'll structure the tool calls accordingly."}

The user wants two things: first, calculate the GCD of 36 and 48, and then estimate the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5.\n\nStarting with the GCD. The math_gcd function requires two positive integers. The user provided 36 and 48, which are both positive integers. So I can directly use the math_gcd function here. The parameters a and b should be 36 and 48. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Wait, 48 is larger than 36. Oh, does the order matter for GCD? No, because GCD(a, b) is the same as GCD(b, a). So even if a is supposed to be the larger one, the function might handle it regardless. But maybe the function expects a to be larger. Let me check the parameters again. The param a's description says \"the first and larger positive integer\". Hmm, maybe the user intended to pass 48 as a and 36 as b. But the function should work even if a is smaller, right? Because mathematically, GCD(36,48) is the same as GCD(48,36). So I'll proceed with a=36 and b=48. The function will compute it correctly.\n\nNext, estimating the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The estimate_derivative function is needed here. The parameters required are the function, x, dx (optional), and method (optional). The user provided f(x) = x\u00b2, which can be represented as a lambda function. The x value is 5. The dx and method are optional, but for a basic estimation, maybe the default values are used. However, the user didn't specify dx or method, so I should use the function with just the required parameters. The function parameter needs to be a callable. In Python, that would be a lambda, but the function's parameter type is \"any\", so perhaps it's expecting a string representation or a lambda. Since the example shows \"lambda x\", maybe the user is expected to pass a lambda function. So the parameters would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. The dx and method can be omitted if they are optional. So the function call would be estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5).\n\nWait, but the function's parameter for \"function\" is type \"any\", which is a bit ambiguous. But given the description, it's a callable. So passing a lambda is correct here. The user's function is f(x) = x\u00b2, so that's straightforward.\n\nSo the two function calls needed are first math_gcd with a=36, b=48, then estimate_derivative with the function, x=5. The order is important as per the user's request: first GCD, then derivative."}

But since the user didn't mention format or keeping the original, maybe we just use the required parameter.\n\nThen, flipping horizontally.

But do these functions need to be called in a specific order? The user said \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally\". Typically, rotation and flipping can be done in any order, but depending on the software, sometimes the order matters. However, since the user specified the order, maybe we should follow it. So first rotate 20 degrees clockwise, then flip horizontally.\n\nNow, check if the parameters are correctly provided. The rotateImageAction requires degrees, which is given. The flipImageAction requires flip_direction, which is given. So both functions can be called with the provided parameters. The other parameters for rotateImageAction (image_format, keep_original) are optional, so they can be omitted.
