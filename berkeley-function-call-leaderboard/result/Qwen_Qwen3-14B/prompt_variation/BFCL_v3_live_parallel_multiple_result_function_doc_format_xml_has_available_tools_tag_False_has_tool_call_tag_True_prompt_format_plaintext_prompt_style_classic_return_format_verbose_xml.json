The user wants me to clone a repository, analyze its contents, create or update a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on that analysis, add the changes to Git, and then commit and push them.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repo. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll leave it as default. So the first function call is clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\nNext, after cloning, I have to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory by default, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (the repo name). So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name set to 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce the analysis is done, I need to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Assuming the analysis determines the correct directory, I'll use the same 'nodejs-welcome' directory. But wait, maybe the analysis result would tell me if the Dockerfile exists or not. However, the user's instruction says to create/update based on analysis. Since the function just creates a Dockerfile, maybe it's intended to run regardless. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. The user didn't specify them, so I'll use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can handle adding changes if the 'commit_message' is provided. Wait, the function's description says it automatically git add all changes. So I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', and maybe a commit message. The user didn't specify a message, so I can use a default like \"Updated Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\". Also, branch name might be needed, but if not provided, it'll default to the current branch. So the parameters would be directory_name, commit_message, and possibly branch_name if required. Since branch_name is optional, I can omit it unless specified.\n\nPutting it all together, the order of function calls is: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github. But wait, the analysis might be needed before creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs. So after cloning, analyze, then create the files based on the analysis. Then push the changes.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called in the correct order. The user's steps are 1, 2 (which includes 2.1 and 2.2), then 3 and 4. So the sequence is correct."}

First, they mentioned a compilation error in their Java project involving the class 'StringNumberHandler' extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. Also, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is figure out which functions to use here. The user is asking for two things: finding classes related to 'CellResult' and getting method signatures from 'AbstractCellHandler'. \n\nLooking at the available functions, 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate for the first part. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified 'CellResult' as the search term and wants to include subdirectories, so I should set 'include_subdirectories' to true. The case sensitivity isn't mentioned, so maybe default to false unless specified, but the user might want exact matches, so perhaps case_sensitive is false by default. Wait, the function's default for case_sensitive is false, so that's okay.\n\nNext, for the method signatures, the 'get_signature' function is needed. The user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. Since there are two methods, I'll need to call 'get_signature' twice, once for each method. The parameters required are 'class_name', 'method_name', and optionally 'include_private'. The user didn't mention private methods, so maybe leave that out unless necessary. But since they're overriding methods, it's likely the methods are public, so no need for include_private.\n\nWait, but the user is extending 'AbstractCellHandler', so the methods in the parent class might be protected or public. The 'include_private' parameter is optional, so maybe it's safe to omit it unless the user specifies. The function's default for include_private is false, so that's okay.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Use 'get_relevant_classes' with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true.\n2. Use 'get_signature' for 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n3. Use 'get_signature' again for 'setCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For 'get_relevant_classes', the required parameter is 'search_string', which is 'CellResult'. The 'include_subdirectories' is set to true as per the user's request. Case sensitivity isn't specified, so default to false.\n\nFor each method signature, the class name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method names are 'getCellValue' and 'setCellValue'. No need for include_private unless the user wants private methods, which they didn't mention. So, those parameters are omitted.\n\nI should check if the functions are correctly called with the right parameters. Also, ensure that the function names are correctly spelled and parameters are in the right format. The user is using Java, so the class and method names should match exactly as they appear in the code.\n\nAnother thing: the user might need to know if 'CellResult' is part of a specific module, but since they didn't mention it, the 'get_relevant_classes' function doesn't require a module name. It searches the repository, so that's covered.\n\nSo, the function calls should be:\n\n- get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\", include_subdirectories true.\n- get_signature for getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler.\n- get_signature for setCellValue in AbstractCellHandler.\n\nThat should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention units, just the numerical value. So I should call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. Queenstown is a town in Singapore, so the location should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit parameter is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it out or set it to a default like 'metric' if needed.

The function's unit parameter might accept 'C' or 'F', but since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better not to assume.

Maybe the function can handle multiple types by using a comma-separated string? The parameters don't specify, but the example shows \"concerts and plays\" as possible events.
