Finding Surfer's Score I've zeroed in on the female surfer's score from the Paris 2024 Olympics. My focus is now on Caroline Marks, the likely surfer, given the image details. I've located her winning score in the final: 10.50. I've also identified her wave scores in the final: 7.50 and 3.00. I also found her semifinal score of 12.17.
