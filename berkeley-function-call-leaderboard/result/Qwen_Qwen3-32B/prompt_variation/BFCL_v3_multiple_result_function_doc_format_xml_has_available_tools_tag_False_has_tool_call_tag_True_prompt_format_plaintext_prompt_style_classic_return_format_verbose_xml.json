Since the user specified the United States, I should include that. \n\nWait, the question is about the cheapest price. But the function just gives the selling price.

So the function should return the current price in the US, which would be the cheapest if there are no other sales. \n\nAlso, there's the video_games.on_sale function. Maybe checking if it's on sale could affect the price. But the store_price function might already account for any current sales. However, the user is asking for the selling price, so maybe just using store_price is sufficient. \n\nI need to call store_price with the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as 'PlayStation', and region as 'United States'. That should get the current price. Since the user wants the cheapest, maybe there's a discount, and the store_price would reflect that. \n\nI don't think I need to check the currency here because the price would already be in the correct currency for the region.

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, starting from rest means the initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed. \n\nI remember there are kinematic equations. One of them relates distance, time, initial speed, and acceleration. But since we need final speed, maybe another equation would be better. \n\nWait, the user mentioned constant acceleration. The first function is calculate_acceleration, which needs initial and final speeds and time, but here we don't know acceleration or final speed. So that might not help directly. \n\nThe second function is calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check its parameters. It requires distance (integer), time (integer), and optionally initial_speed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. Wait, does it return the final speed? Or the average speed? The name says \"calculate_speed_from_rest\"\u2014probably final speed.\n\nThe parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (20 meters), time (4 seconds), and initial_speed (0, but maybe optional). The function might use the equation s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2, and then find final speed v = u + at. Since u is 0, s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Solving for a, then using v = at. Alternatively, the function might combine these steps. \n\nSo, using the second function with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. But the initial_speed is optional and default might be 0. Wait, the function's initial_speed is an integer and required is false. So if not provided, maybe it assumes 0. So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest: distance is required (integer), time is required (integer), initial_speed is optional (integer). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. But the function's initial_speed is an integer. So maybe I should include it. But the user says \"started from rest\", so initial speed is 0. So the parameters would be distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for initial_speed is optional. If the function is designed for starting from rest, maybe initial_speed is assumed 0 by default. But the user's question explicitly states \"started from rest\", so including initial_speed=0 would be safe. \n\nSo the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters for initial_speed is of type integer. The user's input is 0, which is an integer. So that's okay. \n\nTherefore, the tool call should be to calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to approach this. Since it's the same gas, the molar mass isn't a factor here. The key is to use the principle of conservation of energy, assuming no heat loss. The heat from the warmer gas will transfer to the cooler one until they reach equilibrium.\n\nThe formula for the final temperature when mixing gases is (quantity1 * temp1 + quantity2 * temp2) / (quantity1 + quantity2). That makes sense because it's a weighted average based on the moles of each gas.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called calculate_final_temperature.

The parameters required are location and art_form. The user mentioned New York and modern sculpture, so that fits. The month is \"upcoming,\" which the function's month parameter can handle, maybe by defaulting to the next month if not specified. The user ratings are to be top-rated, so setting user_ratings to 'high' makes sense.\n\nSo I should call find_exhibition with location as \"New York\", art_form as \"modern sculpture\", month as \"upcoming\", and user_ratings as \"high\". Wait, the function's month parameter says the default is upcoming events, so maybe the month can be omitted. But the user specifically says \"upcoming month\", so including it might be better. Also, the user_ratings parameter defaults to 'high', so if we set it to 'high', that's covered. Let me check the function's parameters again.\n\nThe find_exhibition function has location (required), art_form (required), month (optional, default is upcoming), and user_ratings (optional, default is 'high'). Since the user wants upcoming, we can leave month as default. But the user says \"upcoming month\", which might be the same as the default. So maybe just specify location and art_form, and let the other parameters use their defaults. But to be safe, maybe include month as the upcoming month. Wait, how does the function handle the month? The description says the default returns upcoming events, so maybe specifying the month isn't necessary. The user's query is about the upcoming month, so the default should cover it. So the function call would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"sculpture\", and user_ratings: \"high\". Wait, the art_form is \"modern sculpture\"? Or just \"sculpture\"? The user says \"modern sculpture exhibition\". The function's art_form parameter example is \"sculpture\", so maybe just \"sculpture\" is sufficient. But the user specified \"modern\" as part of the art form. Hmm. Maybe the art_form should be \"modern sculpture\". Let me check the function's description again. The desc says \"the form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" So the example is \"sculpture\", but the user is asking for modern sculpture. Maybe the function can handle more specific terms. So I'll use \"modern sculpture\" for art_form. Alternatively, if the system expects just \"sculpture\", but the user wants modern, perhaps that's a filter. But since the function's example is \"sculpture\", maybe the art_form should be \"sculpture\", and the \"modern\" is an additional filter. However, the function's parameters don't have a way to specify the era. So perhaps the best approach is to set art_form to \"sculpture\" and rely on the function to return exhibitions that are modern, possibly through other parameters. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form. Since the user explicitly says \"modern sculpture\", I'll use that. So the parameters would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"modern sculpture\", month: \"upcoming\", user_ratings: \"high\". But since month's default is upcoming, maybe it's redundant. So the function call would be:\n\nfind_exhibition with location=\"New York\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\".\n\nThat should get the top-rated (high user ratings) modern sculpture exhibitions in New York for the upcoming month."}
