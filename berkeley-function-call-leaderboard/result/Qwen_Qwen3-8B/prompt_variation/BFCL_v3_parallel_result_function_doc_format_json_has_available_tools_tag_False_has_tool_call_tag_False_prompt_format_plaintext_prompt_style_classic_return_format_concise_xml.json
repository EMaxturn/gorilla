The user wants to find two movie theatres near San Diego showing Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm. The available function is find_movie_showing. \n\nFirst, check the parameters required: location, movie, and time. The location is San Diego, CA. The movies are Tenet and No Time To Die. The times are 5 pm and 7:30 pm. \n\nWait, the movie parameter is an array of strings, and the enum only includes Tenet and No Time To Die. So that's good. The time is also an array. The user is asking for two different movies with specific times. So I need to call the function once for each movie and time combination? Or can I include both in one call?\n\nLooking at the function's parameters, the movie is an array, so maybe I can pass both movies in one call. But the time parameter is an array as well. However, each movie has a different time. So perhaps the function expects each movie to have a corresponding time. But the parameters are structured as arrays, so maybe the function can handle multiple movies and times in the same call. \n\nWait, the parameters are location (string), movie (array of strings from the enum), and time (array of strings). So the user is asking for two different movies with two different times. So the movie array would have both \"Tenet\" and \"No Time To Die\", and the time array would have \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\". The location is \"San Diego, CA\". \n\nBut the function's required parameters are all present. So the correct call would be to pass location as \"San Diego, CA\", movie as [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], and time as [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]. \n\nWait, but the function's time parameter is an array of strings, but does it expect each time to correspond to each movie? The description says \"show time for each movie\", so maybe the function can handle multiple movies and their respective times in the same call. Therefore, the function call should include both movies and their times in the arrays. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nlocation: \"San Diego, CA\"\n\nmovie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n\ntime: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\nThat should cover both movies and their respective times. The function should return the theatres showing both movies at those times. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The movie array includes both titles, and the time array has the two times. The location is correctly specified. So the function call should be made with these parameters."}

user's question. They want to know two things: how to make magenta with watercolor and how to make navy with acrylic paint, including quantities.\n\nFirst, I check the available functions. There's only one function: paint_color_mixture, which takes paint_type and color. The description says it gives a combination of primary colors to mix for a certain color. But wait, the function's parameters don't include quantities. The user is asking for quantities of each color, but the function as described doesn't provide that information. The parameters required are paint_type (string) and color (string). \n\nSo, the user's request requires information that the function might not support. The function might only return the combination of colors, not the exact quantities. But since the user is asking for quantities, and the function doesn't have a parameter for that, maybe the function's output includes quantities? Wait, the function's parameters don't include quantity, so maybe the function doesn't return it. The user's question is about quantities, which the function might not handle. \n\nBut the user is asking for the combination and quantities. Since the function is the only tool available, maybe I should call it twice: once for watercolor and magenta, and once for acrylic and navy. Even though the function might not provide quantities, perhaps the answer expects using the function to get the color mix, and then the quantities are inferred or assumed. Alternatively, maybe the function's output includes quantities, but the parameters don't have a quantity field. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are paint_type and color. The function's description says it gives a combination of primary colors. So maybe the function returns the colors needed, but not the quantities. However, the user is asking for quantities. Since the function doesn't have a parameter for quantity, perhaps the function can't answer the quantity part. But the user might not have other functions, so maybe the assistant has to use the function as much as possible. \n\nSo, the user's question has two parts: magenta with watercolor and navy with acrylic. The function can be called for each part. Even if the function doesn't return quantities, the assistant might have to call it. But the user specifically asked for quantities. Since the function's parameters don't include quantity, maybe the function can't provide that. However, the user might be expecting the function to return the quantities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's output includes the quantities, but the parameters don't have a quantity field. The function's parameters are only paint_type and color. So, the assistant can call the function for each case, but the answer might not include quantities. However, the user is asking for quantities, so the assistant might need to point out that the function is missing parameters. \n\nWait, the user's question is in Chinese, but the instructions are in English. Let me recheck. The user is asking for the function calls in the response. So, the assistant should only return the function calls in the response. \n\nSo, the user is asking for the function calls. The user's question is to be answered by the assistant. The assistant should return the function calls in the specified format. \n\nNow, the user's question is: \"What is the capital of France?\" and the available functions are given.

The date is next Friday, which I should format as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The genre is classical, and amenities should include parking.
