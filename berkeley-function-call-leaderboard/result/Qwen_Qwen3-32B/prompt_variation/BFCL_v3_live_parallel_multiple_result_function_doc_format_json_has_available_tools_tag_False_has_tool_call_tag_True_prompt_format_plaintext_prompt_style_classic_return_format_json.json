They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user mentioned \"Caesar salad without anchovies,\" so foodItem is \"Caesar salad,\" and removeIngredients should be \"anchovies.\" No new ingredients or special instructions are specified, so those can be default or empty.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences include size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type, and special_instructions. The user specified large, hot, regular sweetness, almond milk. So the new_preferences dict should have those values. Special instructions aren't mentioned, so it's empty.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. For the food, removeIngredients is a comma-separated string. For the drink, the enums must match the allowed values. The size is \"large,\" temperature is \"hot,\" sweetness_level \"regular,\" and milk_type \"almond.\" All these are valid per the function definitions.\n\nSo two function calls: one for ChaFod with the salad and remove anchovies, and another for ChaDri.change_drink with the specified parameters. No missing parameters here. Both functions are necessary to fulfill the request."}

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the clone_repo function. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function requires repo_url, and I can set the destination to a directory name like 'nodejs-welcome' instead of the default current directory. Maybe that's better for organization.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. Once I know the language, I can create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name. Since the repo is Node.js, the Dockerfile will likely use a Node image.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., have defaults, so I can omit them. The image name might need to be set based on the analysis, but the default is 'latest', which might not be ideal. Wait, the user didn't specify the image name, so maybe the default is okay here.\n\nAfter creating the files, I need to push the changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function will handle that. The commit message can be the default, but the user might want a specific one. The branch is 'main' by default, which matches the repo's likely setup.\n\nWait, the user said \"add all changed files to git changes\". The push function's description says it automatically git adds all changes, so maybe that's handled. But I should confirm. The push function's parameters include directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, the push function will add, commit, and push.\n\nNow, checking parameters for each step. For clone_repo, repo_url is required. The destination is optional, but I'll set it to 'nodejs-welcome' to keep it organized. Recursive and depth can be default. \n\nAnalyse_repo_contents needs the directory_name, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. Then create_a_docker_file with the same directory name. Then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the same directory. \n\nFinally, push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', commit message maybe 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs', but the default is 'Update changes'. The user didn't specify a message, so default is okay. Branch is main.\n\nSo the steps in function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination.\n2. analyse_repo_contents on the directory.\n3. create_a_docker_file with the directory.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the directory.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory and possibly a commit message.\n\nWait, the user step 2.1 says create/update Dockerfile based on analysis. The analyse_repo_contents might determine the language, but the create_a_docker_file function doesn't take that into account. Maybe the analysis is just to know the language, but the Dockerfile creation is a separate step. Since the repo is Node.js, the Dockerfile can be created without the analysis, but the user wants it based on analysis. So maybe the analysis is to confirm it's Node.js, then create the Dockerfile accordingly. But the function create_a_docker_file doesn't take parameters for the language, so it's assumed based on the directory's contents. So the analysis is a prerequisite step to know what kind of Dockerfile to create, but the function itself doesn't use that info. So the steps are correct.\n\nSo the function calls would be in order: clone, analyse, create docker, create k8s, push."}

The specific issue is that 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. Since they want to include subdirectories, I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and case sensitivity might be important in Java, but the default is False, so maybe leave it as is unless specified.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides. For that, the 'get_signature' function is the right choice. Each method requires 'class_name', 'method_name', and optionally 'include_private'. Since the user didn't mention private methods, the default (False) should suffice. They need to call this function twice, once for each method.\n\nI should make sure all required parameters are provided. The 'get_relevant_classes' requires 'search_string', which is given. The 'get_signature' calls need 'class_name' and 'method_name', both provided by the user.

The function get_current_weather needs a 'location' parameter. Queenstown is a place in Singapore, so the location should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function also allows specifying the unit, but the user didn't mention Celsius or Fahrenheit. The default is Fahrenheit, but since Singapore uses Celsius, maybe I should set unit='celsius'. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe stick with the default. Wait, the function's default is Fahrenheit, but the user is in Singapore where Celsius is standard. Hmm, but the user didn't specify, so perhaps it's safer to use the default unless told otherwise. Or maybe include the unit parameter to ensure it's in Celsius. The user might expect Celsius. Let me check the function's parameters again. The unit is an enum with celsius or fahrenheit, default is fahrenheit.
