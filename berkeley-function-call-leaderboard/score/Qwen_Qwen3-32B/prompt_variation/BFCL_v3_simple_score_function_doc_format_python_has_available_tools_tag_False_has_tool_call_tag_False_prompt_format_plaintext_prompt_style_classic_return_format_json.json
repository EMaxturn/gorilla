The user is asking about a chord progression in Roman numerals: I, V, vi, IV. They want to identify the key signature.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how chord progressions relate to key signatures. The Roman numerals represent the scale degrees in a key. The I is the tonic, V is the dominant, vi is the submediant, and IV is the subdominant. \n\nThe function provided is music.theory.chordProgression. The parameters are progression, returnAllPossibleKeys, and assumeMajor. The default for assumeMajor is true, so if not specified, it'll assume major. The default for returnAllPossibleKeys is false, so it'll return the first valid key.\n\nThe progression given is I, V, vi, IV. In a major key, the I is major, V is major, vi is minor, and IV is major. Wait, the vi chord in a major key is minor, right? So the progression I (major), V (major), vi (minor), IV (major) would fit a major key. For example, in C major: I is C major, V is G major, vi is A minor, IV is F major. That matches the progression. \n\nSo the function should return the key. Since assumeMajor is true by default, the function will check major keys first. The first valid key would be C major if the progression is in C. But since the user didn't specify a root, maybe the function determines the root based on the progression. Wait, the function's description says it identifies the potential key signature. So the key would be determined by the root of the I chord. But the progression starts with I, so the key is the I chord's root. However, the user hasn't provided a specific root, so maybe the function returns the key as the I chord's root in major or minor. \n\nWait, the function's parameters don't include a root. The progression is given in Roman numerals, which are relative to the key. So the function needs to determine the actual key (like C major, G major, etc.) based on the progression. But how? The Roman numerals are relative to the key, so without knowing the root, the function can't determine the exact key. Wait, maybe the function assumes that the progression is in a major key and returns the key signature based on the I chord's root. For example, if the progression is in C major, the key signature would be 0 sharps. But the user hasn't provided a specific root. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to return the key signature in terms of the root, like 'C major' or 'G major', but the user's example doesn't specify a root. \n\nWait, perhaps the function is designed to return the key signature based on the chords present. For example, if the progression includes I, V, vi, IV in a major key, the key is determined by the root of the I chord. But since the user hasn't provided a specific root, maybe the function returns the key as the I chord's root in major. However, without knowing the actual root, the function might not be able to determine the exact key. Wait, maybe the function is designed to return the key signature in terms of the root, but the user's input is in Roman numerals, which are relative. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the key signature based on the chords' positions. For example, if the progression is I, V, vi, IV in a major key, the key is the I chord's root.

The function's description says it identifies a potential key signature for the given chord progression. The example given in the function's args is ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'], which is the same as the user's input. So maybe the function would return the key signature based on the I chord's root.
