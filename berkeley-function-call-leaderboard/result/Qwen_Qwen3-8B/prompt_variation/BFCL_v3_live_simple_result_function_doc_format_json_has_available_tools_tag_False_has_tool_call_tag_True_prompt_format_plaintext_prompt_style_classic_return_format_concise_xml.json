The function expects the format 'Address, City, State'. The given address seems to fit that format, but I notice the state is CA, which is correct. However, the address might need to be in a more standard format. Wait, the example given in the function's description is '123 Main St, Springfield, IL'. So the user's address is written as '123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704'. The state is CA, which is correct. The city is Berkeley, and the address is 123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc. That should be okay. Maybe the function can handle that format.\n\nNext, the type is 'Plus', which matches the enum values: 'plus', 'comfort', 'black'. The user wrote 'Plus', but the function expects lowercase. So I should convert that to 'plus'.\n\nThe time parameter is 10 minutes, which is an integer. The user said they don't want to wait more than 10 minutes, so the time parameter should be 10.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function call should have loc as '123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704', type as 'plus', and time as 10. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present.

The function getDataForProfessional can retrieve professionals based on service type, location, availability, and rating. The parameters required are service_id, province_id, and optionally district_name, sub_district_name, rating, etc.\n\nThe service_id for ironing is 2, as per the enum in the function description. The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district_name is Sankampang, and the sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating needed is 4.5. \n\nI should make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. The function requires service_id and province_id, which are provided. The other parameters like district and sub-district are optional but specified by the user. The rating is given as 4.5, which is a float. \n\nSo, the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name=\"Sankampang\", sub_district_name=\"Ton Pao\", and rating=4.5.
