The city is required, and the date has a default value if not provided. The user specified Marshall, MN as the city and March 5th, 2023 as the date. So I should call the function with city='Marshall, MN' and date='2023-03-05'. The date is in the correct format, so that's good. The function should return the forecast for that date. I don't see any other parameters needed, so this should be the only function call required."}
