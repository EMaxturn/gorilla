The user wants both cities, so I need to call this function twice, once for each city. \n\nWait, the get_snow_report function also takes a location, but the user didn't mention snow reports. They just asked for the weather. So maybe just the current weather is needed here. \n\nSo, I should make two calls to get_current_weather, one for each city. The parameters should be the city names and the unit (default is fahrenheit). Let me confirm the parameters. The function's arguments are location (str) and unit (default). So each call will have the city name as the location. \n\nI think that's all. No other functions are needed here.

However, the user didn't mention the unit for the mango. Similarly, the pepperoni pizza is two slices, but again, the unit isn't specified. The coffee is a single item, but the function might need a portion amount. Since the user didn't provide the necessary parameters like portion_unit or log_date, I can't call the function.
