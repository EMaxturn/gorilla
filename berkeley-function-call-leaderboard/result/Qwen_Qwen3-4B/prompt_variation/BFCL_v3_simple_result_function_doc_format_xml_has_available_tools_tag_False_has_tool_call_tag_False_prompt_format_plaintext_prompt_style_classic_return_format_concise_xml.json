The status is optional with a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe user specified 'ongoing' status, so I should include that. The company is Google. The start_date is after January 1, 2021. Wait, the function's start_date parameter requires a date in MM-DD-YYY format. The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021? But the function might accept a range. Wait, the function's description says \"start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So perhaps the start_date is the beginning of the range. But the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021. So the start_date should be January 2, 2021? Or maybe the function allows a date range, but the parameter is only start_date. Hmm, the function's parameters only have start_date and no end_date. So maybe the user's request is to start from January 1, 2021, but the function requires the start_date to be the beginning of the range. Wait, the user says \"after January 1, 2021\", so perhaps the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But maybe the function is designed to take the start_date as the earliest date, so if the user wants after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be January 2, 2021. However, maybe the function allows for a date range where start_date is the first day of the range. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to accept the start_date as the earliest date, and the end_date is not required. But since the function only has start_date, perhaps the user's query is to set start_date as January 1, 2021, and the status is ongoing. But the user says \"after\" that date, so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so maybe the user's query is to set start_date as January 1, 2021, and the status is ongoing. But the user wants lawsuits filed after that date. Hmm, maybe the function's start_date is inclusive. So if the user wants after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the user might not have specified the exact date, so perhaps the function is designed to take the start_date as the earliest date, and the system will handle the range. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take the start_date as the earliest date, and the end_date is not required. So in this case, the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, so the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the status is ongoing. But the function's default status is ongoing, so maybe the user can omit it. Wait, the user explicitly says \"ongoing lawsuits\", so including the status as 'ongoing' is better. \n\nSo the parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021' (but the user says after that date, so maybe '01-02-2021'? But the function's start_date is the start of the date range. If the user wants after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the end_date is not provided. But since the function doesn't have an end_date parameter, maybe the user's query is to set start_date as January 1, 2021, and the status is ongoing. However, the function's start_date is the start of the date range. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the end_date is not provided. But since the function doesn't have an end_date, perhaps the user's query is to set start_date as January 1, 2021, and the status is ongoing. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to accept the start_date as the earliest date, and the system will return all lawsuits filed on or after that date. So in this case, the user wants after January 1, 2021, so the start_date should be January 1, 2021. But the user might have intended to start from January 1, 2021, but the function's start_date is the beginning of the range. Therefore, the correct parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'. \n\nWait, but the user says \"after January 1, 2021\", which is strictly after. So maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the function's start_date is the start of the date range. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after that date, the start_date should be January 2, 2021. However, the user might not have specified the exact date, so perhaps the function is designed to take the start_date as the earliest date, and the system will handle it. But the user's query is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, the best approach is to set start_date as '01-01-2021' and status as 'ongoing', since the function's default status is ongoing. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to exclude any lawsuits filed on January 1, 2021, but the function's parameters don't allow for that. Therefore, the correct function call would be to set start_date as '01-01-2021', company as 'Google', location as 'California', and status as 'ongoing'. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"lawsuit_search\">\n  <param name=\"company\" type=\"string\">Google</param>\n  <param name=\"start_date\" type=\"string\">01-01-2021</param>\n  <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">California</param>\n  <param name=\"status\" type=\"string\">ongoing</param>\n</function>"}

The date is next month. Wait, the date parameter expects a string. How should I format that? Maybe \"next month\" is acceptable, but sometimes dates are in a specific format like YYYY-MM. But the function's description says the date is a time frame, so perhaps \"next month\" is okay. Alternatively, maybe the system expects a specific date range. However, the user specified \"next month,\" so I'll use that as the date parameter. \n\nAll required parameters are provided: location (New York), date (next month), genre (pop). So I can call the function with these values. I don't see any missing parameters. The function should retrieve the info they need."}
