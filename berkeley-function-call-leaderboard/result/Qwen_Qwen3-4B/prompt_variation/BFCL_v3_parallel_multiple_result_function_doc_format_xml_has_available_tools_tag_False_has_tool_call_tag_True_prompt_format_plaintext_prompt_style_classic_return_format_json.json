The data_loading function is for loading the CSV file, so I should call that first to get the data into the program. The parameters required are file_path and optionally delimiter. The user mentioned dataset.csv, so the file_path is \"dataset.csv\". The delimiter isn't specified, so I can leave that out or assume it's a comma, but since it's optional, maybe just provide the file path.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y as arrays. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. So after loading the data, I need to extract these columns. But wait, the data_loading function's output isn't specified here. I have to assume that after loading, the data is in a structure where 'sales' and 'future_sales' are available as keys.

The functions need to be called in order. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I don't need to handle anything else. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly set. The data_loading requires file_path, which is provided. The linear_regression_fit needs x and y, which are derived from the loaded data. The return_residuals is optional but needed here.

The available functions are get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nThe get_sculpture_details function requires the museum location and sculpture ID. But the user hasn't provided sculpture IDs, only the dimensions and materials. So maybe that function isn't directly useful here unless we need to get details first. However, the user is asking about price, which relates to the get_artwork_price function. \n\nLooking at get_artwork_price, it needs museum location, material, and size. The user provided both materials (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 and 6x3), along with locations (Philadelphia and New York). So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price with those parameters. \n\nWait, but the function parameters for get_artwork_price require the size as an array. The user's input has sizes as strings like \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to parse those into arrays. For example, the first sculpture's size would be [4, 4] if we take the feet as numbers. But the function's size parameter is an array of numbers, so maybe the user's input needs to be converted. However, the function's description says the size is an array, so perhaps the input should be in numerical form. \n\nBut the user's question doesn't mention sculpture IDs, so maybe we can't use get_sculpture_details here. The user is asking for price based on size and material, which is exactly what get_artwork_price is for. So I should call get_artwork_price for each sculpture. \n\nSo for the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, sculpture_material is marble, sculpture_size is [4,4]. For the second, museum_location is New York, material is bronze, size [6,3]. \n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for size are an array. The user's input has sizes as strings, but the function expects an array of numbers. So I need to extract the numbers from the strings. For example, \"4 ft x 4 ft\" would be [4,4], and \"6 ft x 3 ft\" would be [6,3]. \n\nSo the function calls would be two separate calls: one for each sculpture.

But since the user mentioned San Francisco county, which is in California, it's safe to include the state as California to be precise, but the function allows it to be optional. Either way, the function should work with just entity and county.\n\nThen, the probability of winning a lottery. The total outcomes are 1000, favorable are 5, and round to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes these parameters. So I need to set total_outcomes to 1000, favorable_outcomes to 5, and round_to 3. That should give the probability rounded as requested.\n\nI need to make three separate function calls. Let me check each function's required parameters again to ensure I'm not missing anything. For predict_house_price, all required parameters are there. For lawsuit_search, entity and county are provided, state is optional but default is California, which is correct. For calculate_probability, all required parameters are included, including round_to. So all three functions can be called with the given information. No missing parameters, so the tool calls should be valid."}

They have four separate requests here, so I need to handle each one by calling the appropriate functions.\n\nFirst, the user is asking about collectable fish in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems right. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item type, so I'll include that.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in the Asia region. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. The region here is Asia, so I'll set that. The game is Fortnite, platform is PlayStation.\n\nThird, details of lawsuits against Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name and year. The case_type is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I'll leave it out. Company is Apple Inc., year 2018.\n\nLastly, a binomial probability calculation with 10 trials, 3 successes, and a 0.7 success probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function takes number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All parameters are provided here.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For each function call, check if the parameters are there. For example, in get_collectables_in_season, item_type is optional but the user specified 'fish', so include it. For the lawsuit, case_type is optional, so omit it. All other parameters are present. The binomial function has all required parameters. Alright, that should cover all parts of the query."}
