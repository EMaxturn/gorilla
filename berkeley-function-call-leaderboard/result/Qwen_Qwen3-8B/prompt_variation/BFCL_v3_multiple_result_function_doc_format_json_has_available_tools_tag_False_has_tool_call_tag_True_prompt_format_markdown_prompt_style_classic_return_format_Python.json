The parameters are all integers here. The initial speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The function also has an optional rounding parameter, but the user didn't specify, so I can use the default of 2 decimals. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_displacement are all integers, but the initial_speed in the other function is a float. But in this case, since the user provided integers, it's okay. The required parameters are there. So I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No need for rounding unless specified. So the function call should be straightforward."}

The user is asking for the cheapest selling price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on the PlayStation Store in the US. Hmm, the available functions are store_currency, on_sale, and store_price. \n\nFirst, store_currency gets the currency used in a region, but the question is about price, so maybe not needed here. The on_sale function checks if a game is on sale, but the user wants the price, not the sale status. The store_price function fetches the selling price, which seems directly relevant.\n\nLooking at the parameters for store_price: it requires game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). The user specified PlayStation Store and US, so all required parameters are provided. So I should call store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', and region='United States'. \n\nWait, the region's default is already US, but since the user explicitly mentioned US, including it would be better. No other functions are needed here. So the correct tool call is video_games.store_price with those parameters."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going if it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the physics formulas involved. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The problem mentions constant acceleration, so maybe I should use the equations of motion. The relevant formula here might be the one that relates distance, time, initial speed, and final speed. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the final speed. The function provided is called 'calculate_speed_from_rest', which seems perfect because it's for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The parameters required are distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. Since it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, which is the default. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. \n\nI should make sure that the parameters match. The function requires distance and time, both integers. The user provided those values, so it's all set. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't needed here because we don't have the initial and final speeds or the time. Wait, no, the question is about final speed, not acceleration. So definitely, the correct function is calculate_speed_from_rest. \n\nSo the tool call should be to calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed. Let me double-check the parameters. Yes, the required parameters are distance and time, and initial_speed is optional. So the call is correct."}

Since the user didn't mention anything else, I'll assume standard dice. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7 and n_rolls=2. Wait, the required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. Oh right, sides_per_die is required. Even though it's standard, I need to include it. So sides_per_die=6.

There's the finance.calculate_future_value function. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are initial_investment, rate_of_return, and years.

There's also an optional contribution parameter, but the user didn't mention any additional contributions, so I can set that to 0 or omit it. \n\nWait, the function's parameters specify that rate_of_return is a float.
