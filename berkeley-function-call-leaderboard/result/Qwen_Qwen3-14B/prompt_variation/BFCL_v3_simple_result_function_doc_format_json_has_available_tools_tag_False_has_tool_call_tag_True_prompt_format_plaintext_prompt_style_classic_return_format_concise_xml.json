I need to check the available functions to see which one can handle this request.\n\nLooking at the function provided, it's called sports_team.get_schedule. The parameters required are team_name, num_of_games, league, and location (which is optional). The required parameters are team_name, num_of_games, and league. \n\nThe user specified Manchester United as the team, which covers the team_name. The next 6 games would be num_of_games set to 6. The league is mentioned as Premier League. The location isn't specified, so I can omit that parameter or set it to a default. Since the function's description says that if location isn't provided, all venues are considered, I don't need to include it here.\n\nSo, I need to call the get_schedule function with team_name: \"Manchester United\", num_of_games: 6, and league: \"Premier League\". The location parameter is optional and not provided by the user, so it's left out. All required parameters are present, so the function call should work."}
