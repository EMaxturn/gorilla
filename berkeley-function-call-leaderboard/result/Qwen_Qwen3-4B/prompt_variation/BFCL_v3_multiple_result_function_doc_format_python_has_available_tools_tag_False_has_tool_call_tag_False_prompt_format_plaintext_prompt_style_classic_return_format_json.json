The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The given parameters are initial speed of 20 m/s, acceleration of 10 m/s\u00b2, and time of 5 seconds. The function needed here is kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check the parameters required for that function. The function requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. All the necessary parameters are provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional and defaults to 2, which is acceptable. So I should call the calculate_displacement function with these values. No missing parameters, so the function call is straightforward."}

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price, I should use store_price. The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided, so I can call store_price with these values. The other functions don't relate to price directly, so they aren't needed here. I don't see any missing parameters, so the correct function call is store_price with the given arguments."}

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, which the user has provided: 7 and 10 respectively. \n\nSo I should call that function with those values. I don't see any missing parameters here. The other functions are for squares and circles, which aren't relevant here. So the correct function to use is geometry_rectangle.calculate with width 7 and length 10."}

Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the final speed. The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, so even if not provided, it's okay. But the user mentioned starting from rest, so explicitly setting initial_speed to 0 might be better, but the function's default is already 0. So the parameters would be distance 20, time 4. That should give the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't needed here because we're not given initial and final speeds or time, but rather distance and time. So the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

The question is about mixing gases and finding the final temperature, so the calculate_final_temperature function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_final_temperature: it requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided all these values: quantity1 is 2, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3, and temperature2 is 400 K. So all the necessary parameters are present.\n\nI don't need to use the calculate_mass function here because the problem is about temperature mixing, not mass calculation.

Since the user specified ascending order, I can use the default value. So I need to call sort_list with elements as the list and order as 'asc'. \n\nWait, the parameters for sort_list are elements (required) and order (optional, default 'asc'). The user's request matches the default order, so I can just pass the elements. Let me make sure the function is correctly called. The list is ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], so the function call should be sort_list with elements set to that list. The order parameter is optional, so I don't need to include it if it's the default. \n\nYes, that's right. So the correct function call is sort_list with the elements parameter.

So the desired_sum is 7, n_rolls is 2. I don't think the sides_per_die is specified, so I can leave it as default.

The frequency is optional and defaults to annually, which is what dividend payments are usually measured in. \n\nThe other function is stock_market_data, but that's for stock market data, not specifically dividends. The user is asking about dividends, so the correct function is corporate_finance.dividend_data.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided. The company is Apple Inc., years is 5.
