The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics function for displacement.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters provided by the user are all there: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding isn't specified, so I'll use the default of 2. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters match the function's requirements. The function requires all three (initial_speed, acceleration, time), which are provided. So the correct call is to use calculate_displacement with those values. No need for the other function since they're asking for displacement, not final speed. Alright, that's all the info needed."}

The user is asking for the cheapest selling price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on the PlayStation Store in the US. Hmm, the available functions are store_currency, on_sale, and store_price. \n\nFirst, store_currency gets the currency used in a region for a platform. But the user wants the price, not the currency. On_sale checks if the game is on sale, which might affect the price, but the question is about the selling price, not the sale status. Store_price fetches the selling price directly. \n\nWait, the store_price function's description says it gets the selling price of a game in a specific store and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified US, we can use the default. So I need to call store_price with game_title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. \n\nBut wait, the function's parameters have region as optional with a default of United States. So even if the user didn't specify region, it would default to US. But here the user did specify US, so including it is safe. \n\nSo the correct function call is video_games.store_price with those parameters. The other functions don't directly get the price. On_sale might tell if it's discounted, but the user wants the actual price. So store_price is the right choice."}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are two functions provided. The first one is calculate_acceleration, which needs initial_speed, final_speed, time, and optionally distance. The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which requires distance and time, and initial_speed is optional with a default of 0. \n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. The parameters needed are distance and time. The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (default 0). The user's input matches those parameters. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed. \n\nI don't need the acceleration function here because the question is directly about finding the final speed, not acceleration. So the correct function call is to calculate_speed_from_rest with the given distance and time."}

Since they're the same gas, the molar masses would be the same, but maybe that's not needed here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_final_temperature' which requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The parameters are all integers. The user provided all these values: 2 moles and 300 K for the first, 3 moles and 400 K for the second. So I should call that function with these parameters. \n\nWait, do I need to check if the function is applicable? The description says it's for mixing different quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. Yes, that's exactly the case here. So the function should work. No missing parameters here. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed because the question is about temperature, not mass. So the correct call is to calculate_final_temperature with the given values."}

Since the default for order is 'asc', maybe I don't need to include it, but the user explicitly said ascending, so including it makes sense. I should call sort_list with the elements and order set to 'asc'. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. Elements are an array of strings, which matches the input.

So desired_sum is 7, n_rolls is 2, and sides_per_die is 6. Let me make sure all required parameters are included. Desired_sum and sides_per_die are required, so that's covered.

The question is about veterans, which is a population category. The get_population function has a category parameter that includes things like total, veterans, women, etc. So that seems like the right choice. \n\nThe parameters required are year and category. The year is 1954, and the category is 'veterans'.

Looking at the provided functions, there's 'finance.calculate_future_value' which seems perfect. The parameters required are initial_investment, rate_of_return, years, and optionally contribution. \n\nThe user provided initial_investment as $20,000, which is an integer. The rate of return is 8%, so that's 0.08 as a float. The time frame is 5 years.

The default for user_ratings is 'high', which matches the user's request. The location is New York, and the art_form is modern sculpture.

So I should call find_exhibition with location 'New York, NY', art_form 'modern sculpture', and user_ratings 'high'. Wait, the art_form in the function example was 'sculpture', but the user said 'modern sculpture'. Maybe the function can handle that as a string. Let me check the parameters again. The art_form parameter's description says \"the form of art the exhibition is displaying, e.g., sculpture.\" So maybe 'modern sculpture' is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe 'sculpture' is enough, but the user specified 'modern', so I should include that. Also, the month parameter's default is upcoming, so if the user says 'upcoming month', we can leave month as default.
