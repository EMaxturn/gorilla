However, note that the question asks for the cheapest selling price. Since we are only checking one platform (PlayStation) and one region (United States), the price we get from the store_price function should be the price for that game in that store and region.\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". However, since we are only querying one platform (PlayStation) and one region (United States), there is only one price to fetch? Unless the game has multiple editions or versions? The function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for a given game title, platform, and region. It does not specify edition. We must assume that the function returns the base game price or the only available price? However, the problem does not specify multiple editions. So we can use the `video_games.store_price` function.\n\nAlternatively, note that the question says \"cheapest\", which might imply comparing across platforms or regions? But the question specifies \"in the PlayStation Store in the United States\". So we are only looking at one store and one region.\n\nTherefore, we can simply call `video_games.store_price` for the given game, platform, and region.\n\nBut wait, the function `video_games.store_price` has parameters:\n- game_title (required): string -> we have 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n- platform (required): string -> we have 'PlayStation'\n- region (optional, default to United States): string -> we want 'United States'\n\nSince the region is optional and defaults to United States, we can omit it? However, to be explicit, we can include it.\n\nAlternatively, we could also check if the game is on sale? But the question doesn't ask for sale status, it asks for the selling price. The function `video_games.store_price` should return the current selling price (whether on sale or not). So we don't need to check the sale status separately.\n\nTherefore, we only need to call one function: `video_games.store_price`.\n\nLet's form the function call:\n\nFunction name: video_games.store_price\nParameters:\n  game_title: \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" (note: the user wrote 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', but we should use the exact string as provided? However, the function expects a string. We'll use the string as given in the question, but note that the game title might have variations. We hope the function can handle it.)\n  platform: \"PlayStation\"\n  region: \"United States\"\n\nBut note: the function specification for `video_games.store_price` says the region parameter is optional and defaults to \"United States\". So we could omit it. However, to be explicit and avoid any defaulting issues, we can include it.\n\nAlternatively, if we omit the region, it will default to United States. So both ways are acceptable. We'll include it for clarity.\n\nTherefore, the function call in the required format:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"game_title\" value=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"platform\" value=\"PlayStation\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"region\" value=\"United States\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nBut note: the user wrote \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" (with one 's' in \"Assassins\")? Actually, the correct title is \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\" with an apostrophe and two 's's? However, we must use the string as provided in the question? The question says: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' (without the apostrophe and with one 's'). We should use that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the exact string from the question: \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\"\n\nBut note: the function might require the exact official title? We don't control the function, so we use the string as provided by the user.\n\nSo we'll use: value=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\"\n\nIf the function is designed to handle minor variations, it should work. If not, we might get an error and then we can adjust.\n\nTherefore, the function call is as above."}

Therefore, the appropriate function is corporate_finance.dividend_data.\n\n Parameters:\n   company: \"Apple Inc\"\n   years: 5\n   frequency: not specified in the question, so we can use the default (annually). However, the question says \"historical dividend payments\", which might be quarterly? But note the function default is annually. Since the question doesn't specify, we can stick with annually or let the function use its default.\n\n But note: the function has an optional parameter 'frequency'. We can choose to omit it and the function will use the default (annually). However, the question says \"payments\", which might imply we want every payment (quarterly). But Apple pays dividends quarterly. So we have two options:\n   Option 1: Use annually to get annual totals? But the function description says: \"historical dividend data\". It doesn't specify if it returns per payment or annual aggregates.\n\n However, the function's parameter description says: \"The frequency of the dividend payment. Default annually\". So if we set frequency to 'quarterly', we get quarterly data? Or if we set to annually, we get annual?\n\n Since the question asks for \"historical dividend payments\", it is likely that the user wants to see each payment (i.e., quarterly). But note: the function does not specify if it aggregates or not. We should try to get the data at the frequency that the company pays. However, the function does not have a way to automatically adjust to the company's payment frequency. Therefore, we have two choices: \n   - Use quarterly to get every payment in the last 5 years (which would be 20 payments if quarterly)\n   - Or use annually and get 5 data points (each being the annual total or the last dividend of the year?).\n\n The function description does not clarify. But since the question says \"payments\" (plural) and Apple pays quarterly, we might want to get the quarterly data.\n\n However, the user didn't specify the frequency. So we can do one of two things:\n   1. Use the default (annually) and return 5 years of annual data.\n   2. Explicitly set frequency to 'quarterly' to get more detailed data.\n\n Since the question says \"historical dividend payments\", which typically means each payment event, I think we should get the quarterly data.\n\n But note: the function's enum for frequency only has ['quarterly', 'annually'].\n\n Therefore, we can call the function with:\n   company: \"Apple Inc\"\n   years: 5\n   frequency: \"quarterly\"\n\n Alternatively, we could call without frequency and let it default to annually? But the question does not specify, so we have to decide.\n\n However, the user's intent: they want to see the dividend payments. Since Apple pays quarterly, they probably expect each quarterly payment. So let's use quarterly.\n\n But note: the function requires the parameter 'years'. We are using 5 for the last five years.\n\n Therefore, the function call should be:\n\n   corporate_finance.dividend_data(company=\"Apple Inc\", years=5, frequency=\"quarterly\")\n\n However, the function parameters in the required list are only ['company', 'years'].

Actually, looking at the function description for get_population: \n   \"The population category (e.g., total, veterans, women)\" -> it says \"veterans\" with an 'a'? \n   Wait, in the provided function description, it says: \n        \"category\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The population category (e.g., total, veterans, women)\" }\n\n   So the example includes \"veterans\". Therefore, we use \"veterans\" or \"veterans\"? \n   Actually, the description has a typo? It says \"veterans\" in the example? \n\n   Let me read again: \n        \"The population category (e.g., total, veterans, women)\"\n\n   So it is spelled \"veterans\" in the example? Actually, it says \"veterans\" or \"veterans\"? \n\n   In the JSON string provided, it is written as: \n        \"category\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The population category (e.g., total, veterans, women)\" }\n\n   So the example says \"veterans\" (if it was written with an 'a')? Actually, it says \"veterans\" (with an 'e')? \n\n   The word is spelled \"veterans\" or \"veterans\"? The correct spelling is \"veterans\". \n\n   I think the description has a typo? But in the JSON, it's written as \"veterans\" or \"veterans\"? \n\n   Actually, looking at the original function description in the JSON:\n        \"description\": \"The population category (e.g., total, veterans, women)\"\n\n   So it is written as \"veterans\". Therefore, we use \"veterans\".\n\n But note: the function might actually require the exact string as in the system's internal categories. However, without knowing the exact categories the system uses, we rely on the example. \n\n Since the example includes \"veterans\", we use \"veterans\".\n\n Therefore, we call:\n   get_population(year=1954, category=\"veterans\")\n\n However, the function parameter name is \"category\", and we are using the string \"veterans\".\n\n Let's write the function call in the required XML format:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"get_population\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"year\" value=\"1954\" type=\"integer\"/>\n        <param name=\"category\" value=\"veterans\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n But note: the value for the category is \"veterans\", not \"veterans\". We are using the correct spelling.\n\n However, in the XML, we must write the value exactly as the string. So we write: value=\"veterans\"\n\n But wait, the function description example says \"veterans\" (with an 'a')? Actually, I see now: \n        The original function description in the provided JSON: \n            \"category\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The population category (e.g., total, veterans, women)\" }\n\n        Here, the example includes \"veterans\" (with an 'e')?

We don't have a list of valid categories. We have to go by the example.\n\n Alternatively, the user's question says \"veterans\", so we use that.\n\n Therefore, we output the above XML.\n\n However, note: the function might return data that includes the count of veterans.

However, note the function parameter expects a string for art_form. Since the example says \"sculpture\", we can try \"sculpture\" but the user said \"modern sculpture\". We can use \"modern sculpture\" and hope the function can handle it, or if not, we might have to adjust. But the function does not specify that it must be from a fixed set, so we can use \"modern sculpture\".\n- Month: upcoming month. The function parameter for month is a string and the description says \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" Since we want the upcoming month, we can leave the month parameter out and let it default to upcoming events? But note: the required parameters are only location and art_form. So we don't have to provide month. However, the user specifically says \"upcoming month\". We can set month to the next month? But the function doesn't specify the format. Alternatively, we can rely on the default which returns upcoming events and then we are looking for the top rated.\n\nAlso, we are asked for \"top rated\". The function has a parameter `user_ratings` which we can set to 'high' to get high rated exhibitions. The default is already 'high', but to be explicit we can set it to 'high'.\n\nSo, we can call:\nfind_exhibition with:\n  location: \"New York, NY\"\n  art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n  user_ratings: \"high\"\n\nWe are not specifying month because the default returns upcoming events, which should include the upcoming month.\n\nBut note: the function description says the default for month returns upcoming events. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the function call will be:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n    <param name=\"art_form\" value=\"modern sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n    <param name=\"user_ratings\" value=\"high\" type=\"string\"/>\n  </params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n\nHowever, note that the `find_exhibition` function requires two parameters: location and art_form. We are providing both and also the optional user_ratings.\n\nBut wait: the problem asks for the \"top rated\", which we interpret as high user ratings. Also, the function's `user_ratings` parameter is an enum and we are using 'high' which is allowed.\n\nLet's output the function call accordingly."}
