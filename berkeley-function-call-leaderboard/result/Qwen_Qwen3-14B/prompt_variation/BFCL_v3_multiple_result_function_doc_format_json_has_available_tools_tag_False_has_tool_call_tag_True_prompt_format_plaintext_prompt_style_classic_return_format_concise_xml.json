The required parameters are all provided here: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2 decimals. The user didn't specify rounding, so I'll use the default.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters match. The function expects integers for initial_speed, acceleration, and time.

The region has a default, but since the user specified it, I should include that. So I need to call store_price with those parameters.

Let me look at its parameters. It requires distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). The user provided distance=20 meters and time=4 seconds. Since initial speed is 0 (from rest), that's covered by the default. So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speed plus time, but we don't have final speed here. So yeah, the correct function is calculate_speed_from_rest."}

Wait, the default is upcoming events, so maybe leaving month as default is okay. But the user says \"upcoming month,\" so maybe specifying the month as the next month. However, the function's month parameter's default is to return upcoming events, so maybe it's better to use the default. But the user says \"upcoming month,\" which might mean the next month. However, without knowing the current date, the function might handle it. Also, user_ratings is set to 'high' by default, which aligns with \"top rated.\" So the parameters would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"sculpture\", and user_ratings: \"high\".
