But the function's XML does not specify the type for the dict values.\n\n We'll pass as strings to be safe.\n\n Alternatively, the API might accept integers. Without documentation, we cannot be sure.\n\n However, the function description does not specify, so we can choose either. Let's use strings because the pod and node IDs are given as numbers in the request but they are identifiers.\n\n Therefore, the parameters for the function call:\n\n   url: \"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\"\n   params: {\n        \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n        \"podId\": \"10\",\n        \"nodeId\": \"12\"\n   }\n\n However, note: the endpoint might require additional parameters? The problem only asks for Ethernet interface statistics. \n But the endpoint might return all interfaces (including loopback, etc.). We are not asked to filter by interface type in the call.\n\n Since the problem does not specify an interface name, we are getting all interfaces for the node.\n\n Let's proceed with this.\n\n Important: The URL must use HTTPS and the IP provided.\n\n Therefore, the function call in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"requests.get\",\"parameters\":{\"url\":\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\",\"params\":{\"fabricName\":\"Network1\",\"podId\":\"10\",\"nodeId\":\"12\"}}}]\n```\n\nBut note: the function's base URL in the example was: 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\nWe have replaced {ip} with 192.120.45.67.\n\nHowever, the example base URL has two instances of \"api\" in the path. That might be a typo? But we are following the example.\n\nAlternatively, it might be intended. We'll use the example as given.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut wait: the function description says the URL should be without query parameters. We are providing the base URL and then the query parameters in the `params` dict.\n\nThis is correct for the `requests.get` function: the `params` will be appended as query string.\n\nWe are not missing any required parameters? The user provided all: fabric (Network1), pod (10), node (12), and the IP.\n\nTherefore, we have everything."}

We should use the provided IP and the base path.\n\n We are also given specific parameters for the request. The parameters in the request should be:\n   fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, infoType\n\n Steps:\n 1. Construct the base URL: We use the IP provided. The URL should be:\n      `https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo`\n\n 2. The query parameters dictionary should include:\n      'fabricName': 'Network1'\n      'nodeId': 12   (note: the type might be integer, but the function expects string? However, the API may accept integers in query string. But in HTTP, parameters are strings. We can pass as integers and let the requests library convert to string? Actually, the function expects a dictionary of parameters and the requests library will handle conversion. We can use the integer and it will be converted to string in the URL.)\n\n However, looking at the function definition, the `params` parameter is a dictionary. The requests library will convert the values to strings appropriately.\n\n 3. The parameters we have are:\n      fabricName: 'Network1'\n      nodeId: 12\n      podId: 10\n      interfaceType: 'Ethernet'\n      infoType: 'Speed'\n\n But note: the function parameter `params` is required and we have all the necessary parameters.\n\n 4. We must use the function `requests.get` with the constructed URL and parameters.\n\n Important: The function name in the call must be exactly as given: \"requests.get\"\n\n Let's format the function call in JSON as required.\n\n Note: The URL must be a string and the params must be a dictionary (object in JSON).\n\n We are not told to use any authentication, so we assume that the API does not require additional headers or tokens in this context.\n\n However, note that the function description does not mention authentication. Since the problem does not provide any authentication details, we assume that the API is accessible without authentication or that the authentication is handled outside (like in the environment). We just form the request.\n\n Therefore, the function call will be:\n\n ```json\n [\n   {\n     \"function\": \"requests.get\",\n     \"parameters\": {\n       \"url\": \"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\",\n       \"params\": {\n         \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n         \"nodeId\": 12,\n         \"podId\": 10,\n         \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n         \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n ]\n ```\n\n However, note that the version 6.3.1 is provided. We are not including the version in the URL. But the base URL provided in the function description does not have a version. If the API version is part of the base URL, we might need to adjust. But the description says the base path without query parameters is as given. So we stick to that.\n\n Let me double-check: the function description says:\n   \"The URL endpoint to send the GET request to. This should include the base path without query parameters, e.g., 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\"\n\n So we are using that pattern.\n\n Since the user provided the version, it might be that the base URL changes with version? But the example does not include the version. We are not instructed to change the base URL by version. Therefore, we use the base URL as described.\n\n We have all the required parameters.\n\n So we output the function call in the specified format."}

Since the user asked for \"with a review of 4.5 stars\", we assume they want exactly 4.5? Or at least? \n The problem doesn't specify. Since the function doesn't specify, we assume that the function is designed to return professionals with rating equal to or above the provided rating? \n But the parameter description says: \"The average rating of the service provider's review score\". It doesn't specify the condition. \n\n However, in practice, when we filter by rating we usually mean at least that rating. So we'll set 4.5 to get professionals with rating of 4.5 or higher? \n But the user might be looking for exactly 4.5? Since the function doesn't have a parameter for exact match, we have to rely on the function's design.\n\n Since we are not sure, and the function does not have a parameter for comparison operator, we must use the rating as provided and hope the function is designed to return >=.\n\n Alternatively, the function might be designed for exact match? That would be unusual. \n\n However, the problem states: \"Retrieve a list of professional workers who meet specified criteria\", and one criterion is rating. Without additional information, we have to assume the function is designed to return professionals with rating >= the provided value? \n\n But note: the user said \"with a review of 4.5 stars\". In common usage, that means at least 4.5. So we'll set rating=4.5.\n\n However, the function parameter is called \"rating\", and the description says \"The average rating\", so we set it to 4.5.\n\n We'll call the function accordingly.\n\n Let's write the function call in the required JSON format."}

Since the function requires exact time, we will use 14:00.\n\n Let's check the requirements:\n   - departure_location: provided as \"JFK\"\n   - departure_date: provided as \"16/03/2024\" (which is after 14/03/2024 -> valid)\n   - departure_time: provided as \"14:00\"\n\n We have all the required parameters.\n\n We will call the function: book_flight with the parameters:\n   departure_location: \"JFK\"\n   departure_date: \"16/03/2024\"\n   departure_time: \"14:00\"\n\n Since the user said \"around 14:00\", we are using 14:00 as the exact time. If the system requires more flexibility, it might be handled by the backend of the function, but the function as defined does not take a range. So we use the given time.\n\n Therefore, we output the function call in the required format."}
