We'll use `create_a_docker_file` function. But note: the function `create_a_docker_file` only creates a Dockerfile. It doesn't update. However, the description says \"Generates a Dockerfile\", so we assume it will create or overwrite. Also, we need the directory name. Since we just cloned, the directory name is likely the last part of the repo URL without the .git. So, 'nodejs-welcome'. But note: the clone_repo function might clone to a directory. We are not specifying a destination, so it will clone to the current directory in a folder named 'nodejs-welcome'. Therefore, we can use that as the directory_name.\n\n   2.2: Create Kubernetes YAML files. We'll use `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function. We need the directory name again. We can use the same.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes. However, note that the function `push_git_changes_to_github` automatically adds all changes. So we don't need a separate step for adding.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push the changes. We'll use `push_git_changes_to_github` function.\n\n However, note: the user did not specify a branch or commit message. We'll use default values for optional parameters.\n\n Let's plan:\n\n  1. clone_repo: \n        repo_url = \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n        We don't specify destination, so it will clone to a directory named \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n  2.1. create_a_docker_file: \n        directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"   (since the repo is cloned into this folder)\n\n  2.2. create_kubernetes_yaml_file:\n        directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n        We don't have specific parameters for deployment, image, etc. So we'll use the defaults.\n\n  3. and 4. push_git_changes_to_github:\n        directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n        We need to provide a commit_message. Since not provided, we can use a default one? But the function allows it to be optional? Actually, the function says \"required=false\". But note: if we don't provide a commit message, the commit might fail. So we should provide one. Let's use \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\".\n        We don't specify branch_name, so it will push to the current branch (probably the default branch, which is main or master). \n        We don't force_push, so we leave it as false.\n\n However, note: the analysis step. We have a function `analyse_repo_contents` that we are supposed to use to determine the language? But the instructions for step 2 say \"based on the analysis\". But our `create_a_docker_file` function doesn't take the language? How does it know? Actually, the function `create_a_docker_file` does not take any language parameter. It only takes the directory name. So it might be that the function `create_a_docker_file` internally does the analysis? Or we are missing a step.\n\n Looking at the function descriptions:\n\n   `analyse_repo_contents`: Analyzes the contents and determines the predominant programming language.\n\n   `create_a_docker_file`: Generates a Dockerfile. It doesn't say it does analysis. So we must call `analyse_repo_contents` first? But the `create_a_docker_file` function doesn't use the analysis result. \n\n How should we proceed? The problem says \"based on the analysis\". We are not given a function that creates a Dockerfile for a specific language. So we have two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The function `create_a_docker_file` internally does the analysis? But the description doesn't say so.\n\n   Possibility 2: We are expected to use the result from `analyse_repo_contents` to decide how to create the Dockerfile? But we don't have a function that takes the language as input to create the Dockerfile.\n\n Since we don't have a function that takes the language, and the `create_a_docker_file` function only takes the directory name, we have to assume that it does the analysis internally? Or maybe it doesn't and just creates a generic Dockerfile? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that we are missing a function. But we must work with what we have.\n\n Let me reexamine the functions:\n\n   We have `analyse_repo_contents` that returns the predominant language. We don't have a function that uses that language to create a Dockerfile. \n\n   However, note: the user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". So we must do the analysis and then create the Dockerfile accordingly. But without a function that uses the language, we cannot. \n\n   Therefore, we must point out that we lack the function to create a Dockerfile for a specific language? But we are required to use the given functions.\n\n   Alternatively, the function `create_a_docker_file` might be designed to use the analysis? But its description does not say so.\n\n   Since the problem says we must use the steps, and we are allowed to call multiple functions, let's do:\n\n      Step 2.0: Call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory to get the language? But note: we don't have a function that returns a value? The functions are actions. How do we get the result of the analysis? The function `analyse_repo_contents` doesn't have an output that we can use in the next step? \n\n   This is a problem. The function `analyse_repo_contents` is described as determining the predominant language, but we don't have a way to get that result? \n\n   How about: maybe the function `create_a_docker_file` uses the same analysis? It might be that the function `create_a_docker_file` will look at the directory and create a Dockerfile accordingly? Then we don't need to explicitly call `analyse_repo_contents`? \n\n   Since the problem says we have to use the steps, and step 2 says \"analyse the contents\", we must call `analyse_repo_contents`? But then what do we do with the result? \n\n   Given the constraints, I think we have to assume that the function `create_a_docker_file` internally does the analysis? Or maybe the analysis step is just for our own knowledge? \n\n   Alternatively, the function `analyse_repo_contents` might set some state that `create_a_docker_file` uses? But that's not specified.\n\n   Since we cannot pass the language to `create_a_docker_file`, we have to skip using the analysis result? Or maybe we are overcomplicating.\n\n   Let me read the function `create_a_docker_file` again: it says \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory to enable containerization of the application.\" It doesn't say it uses the analysis. So we have a problem.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Do all the following using the steps provided in their respective sections.\" and step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". We are not given a function that uses the analysis. So we must point it out? But the instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But we are in the middle of a multi-step process.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I think we have to proceed without the analysis step for the Dockerfile? Or call `analyse_repo_contents` and then `create_a_docker_file` and hope that the `create_a_docker_file` function uses the analysis? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that the `create_a_docker_file` function is designed to work after an analysis? But we are not told.\n\n   Since we are required to follow the steps, we will:\n\n      - Step 2: call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory. But note: the function `analyse_repo_contents` does not return the result to us? How do we use it? \n\n   Actually, the function `analyse_repo_contents` is an action function. It might store the result in a file or set a state? But we are not told. So we cannot rely on that.\n\n   Therefore, I think we have to skip the explicit call to `analyse_repo_contents` because we cannot use its result. Instead, we assume that `create_a_docker_file` will do the necessary analysis? \n\n   But the problem says step 2: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we must call `analyse_repo_contents`? \n\n   How about: we call `analyse_repo_contents` and then `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` without the language? \n\n   Without a way to pass the language, it's the best we can do.\n\n   So:\n\n      Step 2: \n          - Call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory \"nodejs-welcome\". \n          - Then call `create_a_docker_file` on the same directory.\n          - Then call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` on the same directory.\n\n   We hope that the analysis step sets the context for the next steps? Or maybe it doesn't. But we are following the steps.\n\n   Alternatively, the `analyse_repo_contents` might be unnecessary because the other functions do the analysis? \n\n   Given the instructions, we must do step 2 as written.\n\n   So we break step 2 into:\n\n      a. analyse_repo_contents: directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n      b. create_a_docker_file: directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n      c. create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n   And then push.\n\n   Let's write the function calls:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo\n   Step 2a: analyse_repo_contents\n   Step 2b: create_a_docker_file\n   Step 2c: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n   Step 4: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n   We note that step 3 is handled by the push function.\n\n   Now, we must output the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n   We are going to call:\n\n      clone_repo with repo_url = \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\n      Then analyse_repo_contents with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n      Then create_a_docker_file with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n      Then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n      Then push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message = \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\"\n\n   We are not providing optional parameters for the other functions.\n\n   We output each function call in the TOOLCALL block? But note: the instructions say \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n   We are going to output all the function calls in one TOOLCALL block? Actually, the example shows multiple function calls in one TOOLCALL block. We can do that.\n\n   So:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"clone_repo\">\n    <param name=\"repo_url\" type=\"string\">git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\">\n    <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n    <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n    <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n    <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n    <param name=\"commit_message\" type=\"string\">Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n   However, note: the clone_repo function might create the directory \"nodejs-welcome\", and then the subsequent functions use that directory.\n\n   But what if the clone_repo function doesn't create a directory named exactly \"nodejs-welcome\"? The URL is \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\", so the default directory is \"nodejs-welcome\". So it's safe.\n\n   Also, note: the push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name. We are using the same.\n\n   We are not providing branch_name, so it will use the current branch.\n\n   This should fulfill the request.\n\n   Let's output accordingly."}

Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\nFor the first part, we can use the function `get_relevant_classes` to search for classes related to 'CellResult'. We want to include subdirectories, so we set `include_subdirectories` to true.\n\nFor the second part, we need to get the method signatures for two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can use the function `get_signature` for each method. However, note that the function `get_signature` requires the class name and the method name.\n\nBut note: the user is asking for the signatures of these methods in the `AbstractCellHandler` class. So we will call `get_signature` for each method separately.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nStep 1: Search for classes related to 'CellResult'\n  Function: get_relevant_classes\n  Parameters:\n    search_string: \"CellResult\"\n    include_subdirectories: true   (since we want to include subdirectories)\n\nStep 2: Get the signature of the method 'setCellValue' in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n  Function: get_signature\n  Parameters:\n    class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n    method_name: \"setCellValue\"\n\nStep 3: Get the signature of the method 'getCellValue' in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n  Function: get_signature\n  Parameters:\n    class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n    method_name: \"getCellValue\"\n\nNote: The user might be in a Java project, but the function `get_signature` does not require the language because the function is designed to work with the repository which is in Java? However, the function does not have a parameter for language. So we assume the repository is in the same language.\n\nBut note: the function `get_signature` has an optional parameter `include_private`. Since we are interested in public methods (because we are overriding them) and the user didn't specify, we can omit it (default might be false) or set it to false. We'll omit it.\n\nSimilarly, for `get_relevant_classes`, we don't specify `case_sensitive` so it will default to false (case insensitive) and that's acceptable.\n\nWe are going to make three function calls.

Since the user didn't specify a unisex requirement, we can omit the 'is_unisex' parameter.\n\n Second, we can use Services_1_BookAppointment to book the appointment.
