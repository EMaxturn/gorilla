The system will execute the function and provide the result in the next turn, I assume.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nSo, I might need to output multiple function calls in sequence.\n\nIn my response, I can list multiple function calls, like [func1(), func2()].\n\nI need to plan for that.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should output all necessary calls at once, but since some depend on previous results, I might need to wait.\n\nThe user said: \"calculate the HCF of (45,60) and then use that result to find the HCF with another pair (90,120)\"\n\nSo, explicitly, I need the result of the first HCF to use in the next.\n\nIn my first response, I can only call the initial ones that don't depend on results.\n\nPerhaps call math.hcf(45,60) and math.hcf(90,120) and math.hcf(36,48) and math.hcf(72,96), then in the next turn, use those results to call the final HCFs.\n\nThat might work.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nFirst, calculate:\n\n1.

In biology, muscle cells are often referred to as such, so it should be fine.\n\nThe function's default for detailed is 'false', which I assume is a string, but in the args it's specified as bool.
