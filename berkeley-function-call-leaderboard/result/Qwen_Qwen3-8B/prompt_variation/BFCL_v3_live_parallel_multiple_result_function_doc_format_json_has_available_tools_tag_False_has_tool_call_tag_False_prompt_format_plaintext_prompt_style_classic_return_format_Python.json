First, they want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. Looking at the available functions, there's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the food item. They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they just removed anchovies, maybe that's covered under removeIngredients. So, I'll call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences include size=\"large\", temperature=\"hot\", sweetness_level=\"regular\", and milk_type=\"almond\". The special_instructions aren't mentioned, so that can be default. So, I'll call ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences as a dictionary with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

Paris, France is a country, so 'Paris, France' is correct.

The location for Letterkenny needs to be in 'City, State (abbr)' format. But Ireland's state abbreviation isn't applicable since it's a country. The function's description says if state isn't available, use 'City, Country'. So 'Letterkenny, Ireland' is correct.\n\nSo two function calls: one for Paris with category 'General' and another for Letterkenny with category 'Technology', both language 'en'.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory name. This will determine the predominant language, which is probably Node.js given the repo name.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using the current directory. But wait, the repo might have a specific directory structure. However, the user didn't specify a subdirectory, so assuming the root.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. Same as above. The parameters for Kubernetes include deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. The image name might be based on the repo name, but the default is 'latest', so maybe that's okay. Replicas default to 1, port 80, service type ClusterIP.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, commit_message, branch_name. The user didn't specify a message, so use the default 'Update changes'. Branch is 'main' by default. Force push is False unless needed.\n\nWait, step 3 says add all changed files to Git. But the push function automatically adds changes. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we need to run git add ., but the push function does that. So after creating the files, call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, and branch.\n\nSo the functions in order are: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github. \n\nCheck if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse, directory_name is '.' (current dir). For Dockerfile, directory_name is '.' (assuming the repo is in the current dir). For Kubernetes, same directory. Push requires directory_name, which is the same. So all parameters are there. \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the function calls accordingly."}

The function get_relevant_classes is suitable here. The parameters required are search_string, which should be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories set to true as per the user's request.

So, two calls to get_signature: one for 'setCellValue' and another for 'getCellValue', both with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the methods they're overriding in 'AbstractCellHandler' are expecting 'CellResult' to have 'getNumericValue()', which isn't present.

I remember there's a function called get_area_of_square that takes a size parameter. The required parameter is 'size', which should be a float. The user provided 5 cm, so the size is 5.0. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned \"Queenstown Singapore,\" but I should check if that's a valid location. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user might be referring to Queenstown in Singapore? Or maybe it's a typo. However, I should take the user's input as given. The location parameter can be in the format \"City, Country\" or \"City, State (abbr)\". So, \"Queenstown, Singapore\" would fit as \"City, Country\". The unit is optional with a default of fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify, so I'll use the default.\n\nWait, but does Singapore have a state abbreviation? Singapore is a country, so the format \"Queenstown, Singapore\" should work. Alternatively, maybe the user meant a different Queenstown, but since they specified Singapore, I'll proceed with that. \n\nSo, I need to call both functions. The first function is get_area_of_square with size=5.0, and the second is get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\". \n\nI should check if all parameters are provided.
