The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. Since the user didn't specify the destination, the default is '.' (current directory), and recursive is False by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name. But the user hasn't specified the directory name yet. Wait, the clone_repo might have created a directory, but the user's step 2.1 mentions the analysis. So maybe after cloning, the analysis is done, and then the Dockerfile is created. But the function requires the directory name. Since the user hasn't provided a specific directory name, perhaps the directory is the one where the repo was cloned, which is the current working directory. So I'll use the directory_name as the cloned repo's directory. But the function's parameter is directory_name, which should be a valid path relative to the root. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's name. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome' or whatever the repo's name is. Wait, the repo URL is nodejs-welcome.git, so the directory name might be 'nodejs-welcome'?\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. Again, the directory name is likely the same as the cloned repo. So I'll use the same directory name. The default values for deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type are provided, so maybe the user wants to use defaults unless specified. But the user hasn't provided specific values, so I'll use the defaults.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory_name is the cloned repo's directory. The commit message is default 'Update changes', branch is 'main', and force_push is False. So I'll call push_git_changes_to_github with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is the same as pushing all changes. So the push function is correct here.\n\nNow, let me check if all parameters are covered. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is the cloned repo's directory. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same. For push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is the cloned repo's directory. The commit message and branch are defaults.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url as 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination as '.', recursive False, depth default.\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo's name is that).\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome', deployment_name default, image_name default, replicas default, port default, service_type default.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message default, branch_name 'main', force_push False.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 2.1 and 2.2 might require the directory name to be the same as the cloned repo. So the functions are called with that directory. The user's steps might not specify the directory name, so we assume it's the same as the repo's name.\n\nSo the final function calls would be in the specified format."}

The user is encountering a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The user provided four functions: get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe first part of the question is about finding relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search_string would be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories should be True. The case_sensitive can be left as default (False) unless the user wants case-sensitive search.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function is designed to retrieve method signatures. However, the parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user is asking for the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. So, I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The class_name would be 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method_name would be each of the two methods. The include_private can be set to False unless the user wants private methods, but since the user hasn't specified, default is okay.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides several methods. But the error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. So, the user might be trying to use a method that's not present in 'CellResult'. The relevant classes function would help find classes that might be related to 'CellResult', which could be in the repository. The get_signature function would help verify the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure the overrides are correct.\n\nSo, the plan is to call get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True. Then, call get_signature twice, once for each method. The user might need to check if the methods exist in the class and their signatures. Also, the user might need to ensure that the methods they're overriding are correctly defined in the parent class.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. For get_relevant_classes, the search_string is 'CellResult', case_sensitive is False (default), and include_subdirectories is True. For get_signature, the class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue', and include_private is False. Then another call for 'getCellValue' with the same class_name and include_private.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', case_sensitive=False, include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name 'setCellValue', include_private=False.\n3. get_signature with class_name 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name 'getCellValue', include_private=False.\n\nThat should cover both parts of the user's request."}

So I'll call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location and an optional unit. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\", but I need to check if that's the correct format. The function's example includes \"San Francisco, CA\" or \"Paris, France\", so \"Queenstown, SG\" might be acceptable. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I can use the default, which is Fahrenheit. So I'll call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, SG\" and unit='fahrenheit' (or just leave it out if the default is correct). Wait, the default is 'fahrenheit' as per the function description. So maybe the unit isn't needed here. But the user didn't specify, so maybe it's safe to include it. However, the function's parameters say unit is optional. So the call would be get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\").\n\nWait, the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\" but the function expects a location like \"City, State (abbr)\" or \"City, Country\".
