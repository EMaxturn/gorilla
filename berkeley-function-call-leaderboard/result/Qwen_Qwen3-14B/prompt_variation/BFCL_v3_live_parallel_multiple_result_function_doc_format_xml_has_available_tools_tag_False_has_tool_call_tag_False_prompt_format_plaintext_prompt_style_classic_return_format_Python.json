The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, for the food change. The function ChaFod is used for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the food item. They want it without anchovies, so I should use removeIngredients to take out anchovies. There's no mention of adding new ingredients or special instructions, so those parameters can be omitted.\n\nNext, the drink update. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink ID is 123. The new preferences should include size (large), temperature (hot), sweetness (regular), and milk type (almond milk). These need to be structured into a dictionary. I need to make sure all the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function's requirements.\n\nWait, the drink function's new_preferences is a dict. So I need to convert the user's request into key-value pairs. The user mentioned \"large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\" So the keys might be 'size', 'temperature', 'sweetness', and 'milk'. The values would be 'large', 'hot', 'regular', and 'almond milk' respectively. That should cover all the preferences.\n\nI need to check if all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, which is provided. For the drink, drink_id is 123 and new_preferences is the dict. Both are required. Looks good. No missing parameters here. So the function calls should be made accordingly."}

The user wants me to clone a repository, analyze its contents, create or update a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on that analysis, add the changes to Git, and then commit and push them.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repo. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll leave it as default. So the first function call is clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\nNext, after cloning, I have to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory by default, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (the repo name). So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nOnce the analysis is done, I need to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Assuming the analysis determines the correct directory, I'll use the same directory name. But wait, the analysis might tell me the actual directory structure. However, the user's step 2.1 says to create/update based on analysis. Since the function doesn't take parameters for the Dockerfile content, maybe the analysis result is used to decide if the Dockerfile exists or not. But the function just creates it, so maybe I call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, for Kubernetes YAMLs, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name. The user's step 2.2 says to create based on analysis. The parameters for that function include deployment_name, image_name, etc., but the user hasn't provided specific values. The function has defaults, so maybe I can call it with just the directory_name. But the analysis might influence the parameters. However, since the analysis result isn't available here, perhaps the function uses the directory name as the deployment name and defaults for others. So I'll call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to add all files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can do that. The parameters are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user didn't specify a commit message or branch, so I'll use defaults. The function automatically adds all changes, so I'll call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but the steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" before committing. However, the push function's description says it automatically git add all changes. So maybe the add is handled by the push function. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile and YAMLs, then push which includes adding and committing.\n\nSo the sequence of function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo\n2. analyse_repo_contents\n3. create_a_docker_file\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n5. push_git_changes_to_github\n\nBut the user's step 3 says to add all changed files, which the push function does. So the commit and push are handled by the push function. The commit message is optional, so if not provided, maybe a default is used. The branch name is also optional, so assuming the default branch (like main or master) is used.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. For the Dockerfile, the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'. For Kubernetes, same directory. The push function uses the same directory. The commit message isn't specified, so maybe leave it as default or empty. But the function allows it to be optional. So the final function calls should be in order."}

So, I should use the get_relevant_classes function with the search string 'CellResult' and set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. For that, I'll need to call get_signature for each method. But wait, the get_signature function requires the class name and method name. Since the user mentioned 'AbstractCellHandler', I'll use that as the class_name. However, I should check if the class is in a different module, but the user didn't specify, so maybe the module_name is optional here. Also, the include_private parameter isn't mentioned, so I can leave it as default (false).\n\nWait, the user is working on a Java project. The functions provided don't mention language, but the get_imports function does. However, the current queries are about class info and method signatures, not imports.

I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function requires a location in the format 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. Queenstown is a town in Singapore, so the location should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit isn't specified, so maybe I can leave it out or set it to a default like Celsius. But the function allows unit as optional, so I can just pass the location. So call get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore'.\n\nWait, does Singapore use Celsius? Well, the function's unit parameter is optional, so if not provided, it might default to a standard, but since the user didn't specify, I should just pass the location. The function will handle the unit, or maybe the default is okay. So the parameters are correct as is.\n\nSo both functions are needed here. The user wants both answers.

Wait, the parameters say event_type is a string, so maybe I need to specify each type in separate calls. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if separated by commas, but the description doesn't mention that. To be safe, perhaps make two separate calls: one for concerts and one for plays. But the user said \"any music concerts or theater plays,\" so combining both types into one query might be better. However, the function's parameters might not support multiple types. Let me check the function's parameters again. The event_type is a single string, required. So maybe the user's query can be split into two separate function calls. Alternatively, maybe the system allows passing multiple types as a list, but the function's parameters don't indicate that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" and \"theater\" as separate categories. The user mentioned \"music concerts or theater plays,\" so perhaps using \"concert\" and \"play\" as event_types.

However, given the function's parameters, I can only pass one event_type at a time. Therefore, I'll need to call the function twice, once for each event type. But the user's question is to find \"any\" of the two, so maybe the function can handle both if the event_type is set to a combined value. However, without knowing if the backend supports that, it's safer to make two separate calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"music\" and \"theater,\" but the user specified \"concerts\" and \"plays.\" Let me check the function's description again. The Events_3_FindEvents function lists cultural events like concerts and plays.
