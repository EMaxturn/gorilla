Clone the repo: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n\n2. Analyze the contents of the repo.\n\n   2.1 Create/update Dockerfile based on the analysis.\n\n   2.2 Create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis.\n\n3. Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to use the available tools to achieve this. Let's list out the available functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This can clone a repository. It requires 'repo_url', which is like 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'. The user gave 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', which is an SSH URL. I think it's acceptable, as Git handles both.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This generates a Kubernetes YAML file.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This analyzes the repo and determines the predominant language.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This pushes changes, and it automatically adds all changes.\n\nThe user wants to do this in sequence, so I need to make function calls one by one, as per the multi-turn behavior.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nIn my response, I should only output function calls in the specified format.\n\nSo, for this turn, I need to start with the first step: cloning the repo.\n\nOnce I call a function, the system will execute it and come back, I assume.\n\nStep 1: clone_repo with repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\nAfter cloning, the repo will be in the current directory or specified destination. By default, it's '.'.\n\nThen, step 2: Analyse the contents.\n\nSo, next, I need to call analyse_repo_contents. It requires 'directory_name', which should be the path where the repo is cloned. If I cloned to '.', and assuming the repo is cloned into a subdirectory like 'nodejs-welcome', I need to specify that.\n\nThe clone_repo function's description: \"If omitted, the repository is cloned into the current working directory.\" But typically, Git clones into a subdirectory with the repo name.\n\nFor analyse_repo_contents, 'directory_name' is \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nThat might be confusing. Let's check: for analyse_repo_contents, it's \"The name of the directory where the repository is located.\" Probably, after cloning, if it's cloned to './nodejs-welcome', then directory_name should be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nI need to assume that after cloning, the directory is named based on the repo.\n\nThe user said: \"clone the repo git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" \u2013 so likely, it will be cloned to a directory named 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, for create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file, they also require 'directory_name', which is the repository directory.\n\nSo, sequence:\n\n1. First, call clone_repo with repo_url.\n\n2. Then, call analyse_repo_contents with the directory name, say 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe functions don't know the directory name automatically; I have to specify it.\n\nIn clone_repo, I can specify 'destination', but by default it's '.'.\n\nTo make it clear, I should specify the destination as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe repo_url is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so Git will clone it into a directory named 'nodejs-welcome' if destination is '.'.\n\nI can assume that.\n\nAfter analysis, I need to create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML based on the analysis.\n\nThe analyse_repo_contents just analyzes and probably returns the predominant language, but I don't have a way to use that output directly in my function calls.\n\nIn this setup, I have to call the functions sequentially, and the system will handle the output.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file, it doesn't take the analysis as input; it just creates a Dockerfile in the directory.\n\nSimilarly for Kubernetes.\n\nThe user said: \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\" and \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nBut the available functions don't explicitly take analysis as input. They just require the directory_name.\n\nI need to call analyse_repo_contents first, then based on that, call the others. Since I can't use the output in my response, I just have to call them in order.\n\nFinally, add, commit, and push.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github will automatically git add all changes, then commit and push.\n\nSo, let's outline the function calls I need:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n   - This will clone it, say to './nodejs-welcome'\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // assuming the directory name\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // and other params if needed, but defaults are fine\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='something', etc.)\n\nThe user didn't specify commit message, so use default.\n\nIn one response, I can call multiple functions, as per the format: [func1(), func2(), ...]\n\nThe instructions: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params), ...]\"\n\nI can list multiple in one response.\n\nTo follow multi-turn, I should do as many as possible in this turn.\n\nThe task says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\"\n\nIn this case, I can output all in one go.\n\nI need to ensure the directory_name is correct. Since the repo is 'zelarhq/nodejs-welcome', likely the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has parameters like deployment_name, which defaults to None, but the description says \"use Defaults if not provided\", so I can leave it.\n\nAlright, so my response should be a list of function calls in the specified format.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\n- clone_repo\n\n- analyse_repo_contents\n\n- create_a_docker_file\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file  (I'll use defaults)\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github  (with default commit message, etc.)\n\nThe user said: \"2. analyse the contents of the repo and create following. 2.1 create/update dockerfile based on the analysis. 2.2 kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nSo, perhaps after analyse, then create the files.\n\nIn code, I can't depend on the output, so just call in order.\n\nOne potential issue: push_git_changes_to_github requires the directory to have a Git repo, which it should after cloning.\n\nAlright, let's write it."}

However, the tools don't specify the language; they just say \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax,\" which might mean the tool implementation is in Python, but it can query for other languages. Looking at get_imports, it has a language parameter with options including Java.\n\nFor get_relevant_classes and get_signature, they don't have a language parameter. I need to assume they work for the context, or perhaps point it out if it's an issue.\n\nThe user is talking about Java, but the tools are general. I should proceed if the tools seem applicable.\n\nIn get_relevant_classes, it's about searching the repository, which might be language-agnostic.\n\nFor get_signature, it might assume the class exists in the repository.\n\nI think I can proceed.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1. Call get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True.\n\n2. Call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'setCellValue'.\n\n3.

But the function requires a single event_type. I might need to call it twice, once for each, since the tool doesn't support multiple types in one call.\n\nThe user said \"any music concerts or theater plays\", so I should handle both. The function call format allows multiple function calls in one response, like [func1(), func2()].\n\nThe city is \"Los Angeles\", which should be formatted as 'Los Angeles, CA' based on the description: \"formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'\".

It requires 'city' and optionally 'is_unisex'.\n\n- Services_1_BookAppointment: This is for booking an appointment. It requires 'stylist_name', 'appointment_time', and 'appointment_date'.\n\nFor the first part: Search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA.\n\n- The city should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so that's 'Sunnyvale, CA'.\n\n- The function has an optional parameter 'is_unisex' with default 'dontcare', so I don't need to specify it unless asked.\n\nI can call Services_1_FindProvider with city='Sunnyvale, CA'.\n\nFor the second part: Book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon.\n\n- Stylist_name: 'Elegant Styles' (this seems to be the name of the salon, which fits the description).\n\n- Appointment time: 15:00\n\n- Appointment date: 2023-05-10\n\nThis matches exactly with the requirements for Services_1_BookAppointment.\n\nThe task says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI need to make function calls for both actions. Since there are two separate actions, I should call both functions in this response.\n\nThe tool call format is: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, I can list them in one response.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY contain the function calls, nothing else.\n\nTherefore, I'll output:\n\n[Services_1_FindProvider(city='Sunnyvale, CA'), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')]\n\nIs there any dependency? For example, does booking an appointment require finding the provider first? The user is asking to do both, so I'll assume they are independent.\n\nThe booking function doesn't require any output from the search, so I can call them separately."}
