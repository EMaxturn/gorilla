There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for modifying drink orders. \n\nFor the food change, the function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad without anchovies\". So newIngredients should be \"anchovies\" removed, and maybe add \"salad\" or something. But the parameters are for ingredients and instructions. The user didn't mention removing anchovies, just that they want it without. So maybe newIngredients is \"salad, anchovies\" but wait, the original request says without anchovies. So maybe remove \"anchovies\" from the ingredients. But the function's parameters for removeIngredients are a comma-separated list. So perhaps the newIngredients would be \"salad\" and removeIngredients would be \"anchovies\". But the user didn't specify removing anchovies, just that they want it without. So maybe the function can handle that. \n\nThen for the drink order, the drink_id is 123, and the new_preferences should be {\"regular sweetness\", \"almond milk\"}. The function requires new_preferences as a dict. So the parameters would be drink_id: \"123\" and new_preferences: {\"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\"}.\n\nSo two function calls: one for ChaFod with foodItem \"Caesar salad\", newIngredients \"salad\", removeIngredients \"anchovies\", and specialInstructions maybe empty.

First, they want to clone a Git repository from GitHub. The command given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url, which is provided, and destination is optional. Since the user didn't specify the destination, I'll leave that out.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo's contents. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory_name. The user hasn't provided the directory name yet, but maybe the clone operation will create it. Wait, the clone command might create the directory, so I can assume the directory is already there. But maybe I should check. However, the user's instruction says to use the steps provided, so I'll proceed with the given steps.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned, the directory would be the same as the clone destination. But the user hasn't specified the destination yet. Hmm, maybe I need to make sure the directory is set. Wait, the clone step already creates the directory, so the directory_name for Dockerfile would be the same as the clone destination. But the user's steps mention creating the Dockerfile, so I'll use the directory from the clone operation.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs directory_name. Again, the same directory as the clone operation. The user hasn't specified the YAML names, so I'll use defaults. The parameters include image_name, which defaults to latest if not provided. The user might not have specified, so I'll leave that out.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name and commit message. The user hasn't provided a commit message, so maybe I need to use a default. But the user's steps mention adding changed files, so perhaps the commit message is optional. However, the function requires directory_name. Since the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed with the directory from the clone operation.\n\nFinally, commit and push. The push function needs directory_name and optional parameters. The user hasn't provided a commit message or branch name, so I'll use defaults. The force_push parameter is optional, so I'll leave it out.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with repo_url.\n2. Call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name (assuming it's the same as clone destination).\n3. Call create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n4. Call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n5. Call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and default commit message.\n6. Commit and push.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push function's parameters include directory_name and force_push. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe the directory is the same as the clone destination. So the function calls would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<function name=\"clone_repo\">\n  <param name=\"repo_url\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git</param>\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\">\n  <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n  <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n  <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n  <param name=\"directory_name\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">nodejs-welcome</param>\n</function>\n\nBut wait, the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push function's parameters include directory_name and force_push. Since the user hasn't provided a commit message, maybe the commit message is optional. So the function call would include directory_name and maybe force_push as a default. But the user's instruction says to add all changed files, so perhaps the commit message is needed. However, the function doesn't require it. So I'll proceed with the directory_name and leave other parameters as default.\n\nSo the final answer would have all these function calls in order."}

The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the get_relevant_classes function seems relevant. The parameters for that function include a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case sensitivity parameter can be set to false if the user wants case-insensitive search, but since the error mentions 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is better. The include_subdirectories parameter should be true to include subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. The class here is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the methods are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nSo, the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search string 'CellResult' and include subdirectories.
