So for Paris, we have \"Paris, France\" and for Letterkenny, \"Letterkenny, Ireland\".\n\n We are to get:\n   - For Paris: news in English, category default is 'General' (since not specified, we use default) and language 'en'.\n   - For Letterkenny: news in English, category 'Technology', language 'en'.\n\n We cannot call the function for both locations at once. We have to make two separate function calls.\n\n Let's structure the function calls:\n\n First call for Paris, France:\n   location: \"Paris, France\"\n   category: default to 'General' (so we can omit if we want the default, but the function allows to set it. Since the user didn't specify a category for Paris, we use 'General')\n   language: 'en'\n\n Second call for Letterkenny, Ireland:\n   location: \"Letterkenny, Ireland\"\n   category: 'Technology'\n   language: 'en'\n\n We'll make two function calls within the <functions> tag.\n\n However, note that the function `get_news_report` has a parameter `category` with default 'General'. We can set it explicitly for clarity, but for Paris we don't need to because the default is 'General'. But since the user did not specify any category for Paris, we can leave it as default. But the function call does not require to specify parameters that are default if we are using the default. However, the instructions say to include the parameters as per the format.\n\n But note: the system expects the function call in XML format with parameters. We are allowed to omit parameters that have defaults and we want the default? Actually, the function definition says the default for category is 'General' and for language is 'en'. So for Paris, we can set:\n   location: \"Paris, France\"\n   category: we can omit? But the format requires that we must include the parameters that are required. The required parameter is only location. The others are optional.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here, the function requires location and the others are optional. So we can provide only the location for Paris and let the system use the default for category and language? But the user asked for English, so we must set language to 'en'. For Paris, the user didn't specify category, so we can use the default. But note: the function's default for language is 'en', so we can omit it? However, the user explicitly said \"in English\", so we set it to be safe.\n\n Alternatively, we can set both category and language for both calls to be explicit.\n\n Let me check: the function `get_news_report` has:\n   Args:\n        location (str): ... (required)\n        category (str, default='General'): ...\n        language (str, default='en'): ...\n\n So for Paris:\n   We can set: location=\"Paris, France\", category=\"General\", language=\"en\"\n\n But note: the user didn't specify category for Paris, so we use the default. And for language, the user said \"in English\", so we set to 'en'.\n\n For Letterkenny:\n   location: \"Letterkenny, Ireland\"\n   category: \"Technology\"\n   language: \"en\"\n\n However, the function expects the state in short form for US locations. Since these are not in the US, we use the country name.\n\n We'll make two function calls.\n\n Format:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"get_news_report\">\n    <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">Paris, France</param>\n    <param name=\"category\" type=\"string\">General</param>\n    <param name=\"language\" type=\"string\">en</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"get_news_report\">\n    <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">Letterkenny, Ireland</param>\n    <param name=\"category\" type=\"string\">Technology</param>\n    <param name=\"language\" type=\"string\">en</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the function name is the same for both, but we are calling it twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can do two separate function tags? The example format shows multiple functions inside <functions> tags.

Since we cloned without specifying a destination, the repo will be in a directory named 'nodejs-welcome' (the last part of the repo URL without .git). So the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n   - Then, we call `analyse_repo_contents` to determine the predominant language? But note: the function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the predominant language. However, the task says to create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. But note that the functions we have for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not require the language. They just create generic files? But the problem says \"based on the analysis\". However, looking at the function definitions:\n\n     - `create_a_docker_file`: only requires the directory name. It will create a Dockerfile in that directory. It doesn't take the language as input. So we assume it can handle the analysis internally? But the function description says: \"Generates a Dockerfile ... to enable containerization of the application.\" without specifying how. Since we are only allowed to use the given functions, we will call it with the directory.\n\n     - Similarly, `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` requires several parameters. We don't have the image name yet? The task doesn't specify. We are instructed to create based on the analysis, but the function doesn't take the language. We have to provide parameters. However, note that the function has defaults for some parameters.\n\n   - But wait: the step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". We are not given a function that takes the analysis result. So we must assume that the function `create_a_docker_file` does the analysis internally? Or we are supposed to use `analyse_repo_contents` first? However, the function `analyse_repo_contents` returns the predominant language, but we don't have a function that uses that language to create a Dockerfile. \n\n   - Since the task says \"using the steps provided\", and the functions we have are fixed, we will proceed as follows:\n\n     a) We'll call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory 'nodejs-welcome' to get the language? But note: the task doesn't require the language for the next steps? It just says \"based on the analysis\". However, the functions we have for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs don't take the language. So maybe the analysis step is just to confirm we can create the files? Or perhaps the function `create_a_docker_file` internally does the analysis? \n\n     b) Alternatively, the task might be broken down as:\n        - Step 2: analyse the contents (which we do with `analyse_repo_contents`) and then create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. But the functions for creating those don't require the analysis result. So we can skip using the result? \n\n     c) Since we are required to follow the steps, we will do the analysis even if it doesn't directly feed into the next functions. But note: the function `analyse_repo_contents` returns the predominant language. We are not told to output it, but we can call it for the purpose of analysis.\n\n     d) However, the task does not require the result of the analysis to be used in the subsequent steps? It just says \"based on the analysis\", meaning we have done the analysis and then create the files. The creation functions are independent.\n\n   - So we will:\n        Step 2: call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory 'nodejs-welcome'. (This is step 2, but note step 2.1 and 2.2 are the creation steps.)\n        Then step 2.1: call `create_a_docker_file` with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n        Then step 2.2: call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with:\n            directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n            deployment_name: We are not given, so we can use the default? But the function requires deployment_name. However, the function signature says: \"deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\" -> but note: the description says \"use Defaults if not provided\", but the argument is required? Actually, the function signature in the docstring shows it as required because there's no \"default\" mentioned in the argument? But wait, the docstring says: \n                deployment_name (str): The name to assign to the Kubernetes deployment. use Defaults if not provided.\n\n            How to interpret? The function expects a deployment_name, but if we don't have one, we are to use a default? However, in our function call we must provide a value. The docstring doesn't specify what the default string is. Since the task doesn't specify, we can choose a name. Let's use the directory name as the deployment name? Or note the function has a parameter \"deployment_name\" without a default, so we must provide one. The task doesn't specify, so we have to make one up? But the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. However, we are in the middle of the task and we can choose a reasonable value.\n\n            We'll set deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment'\n\n            For image_name: we don't have one. The function has a default for image_name: 'latest'. But that is the tag. We need the full image name? The function says: \"image_name (str, default='latest')\". This is confusing because an image name usually includes the repository and tag. Since we are building a Docker image, we haven't built it yet. The task doesn't specify an image name. We are just creating the YAML. We can set image_name to a placeholder? The function default is 'latest'. That is not a full image name. But note: the function might use the directory name as the image base? The function description doesn't say. We are forced to pass something. Let's use the directory name as the image base? But the task doesn't specify. We'll set image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest'\n\n            replicas: default is 1, which we can use.\n            port: we don't know, but the default is 80. We can use 80? But the application might run on a different port. The analysis step might have told us, but we didn't get that from the analysis function. So we'll use the default 80.\n            service_type: default is 'ClusterIP'\n\n        However, note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` is described to generate both deployment and service.\n\n Step 3: add all changed files to git changes. But note the function `push_git_changes_to_github` automatically does a git add all. So step 3 is included in step 4.\n\n Step 4: commit and push the changes. We'll use `push_git_changes_to_github` with:\n        directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n        commit_message: The task doesn't specify, so we use the default 'Update changes'\n        branch_name: The task doesn't specify, so we use the default 'main'\n        force_push: default false.\n\n But note: the task says \"commit / push to repo\". We are using the push function that does both.\n\n However, we must note: we are creating two new files (Dockerfile and the Kubernetes YAMLs) and possibly modifying others? But the analysis step might not create any file? The function `analyse_repo_contents` only returns the language, so it doesn't create a file. The Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs are created by their respective functions.\n\n So the plan:\n\n 1. Clone the repo: clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n 2. Analyse: analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n 3. Create Dockerfile: create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n 4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome-deployment', image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest', replicas=1, port=80, service_type='ClusterIP')\n 5. Push changes: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n But note: the task says step 2.1 and 2.2 are based on the analysis. We are doing the analysis (step 2) and then the creation (steps 2.1 and 2.2). So the order is correct.\n\n However, we must consider: the directory name is the same for all steps: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n Now, we write the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n Important: We are to return only the function calls in the specified format.\n\n We have to make multiple function calls. We wrap them in <functions> and each function in <function> tags.\n\n Let's do:\n\n Step 1: clone_repo\n Step 2: analyse_repo_contents\n Step 3: create_a_docker_file\n Step 4: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n Step 5: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n But note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` requires several parameters. We set:\n   deployment_name: 'nodejs-welcome-deployment'\n   image_name: 'nodejs-welcome:latest'\n   replicas: 1 (integer)\n   port: 80 (integer)\n   service_type: 'ClusterIP'\n\n We are not forced to use these values, but they are reasonable.\n\n However, note: the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also has the parameter `directory_name` which we set to 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n We'll write the function calls accordingly.\n\n But note: the task says \"Do all the following using the steps provided in their respective sections.\" and we are following the steps.\n\n Let's generate the XML."}

The default is False so we can omit if we want the default)\n      include_subdirectories: True (because the user said \"including subdirectories\")\n\nTask 2:\n   We need two signatures: \n      - For method \"setCellValue\" in class \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n      - For method \"getCellValue\" in class \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n\nWe'll make two separate calls to `get_signature` for each method.\n\nBut note: the function `get_signature` has an optional parameter `include_private` which defaults to False. We don't need private methods, so we can omit that.\n\nSo we will have:\n   First call: \n        class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n        method_name: \"setCellValue\"\n\n   Second call:\n        class_name: \"AbstractCellHandler\"\n        method_name: \"getCellValue\"\n\nHowever, the user might be in a Java project and the class might be in a package? But the function doesn't take a module or package name. The function `get_signature` only takes class_name and method_name. We must assume that the function can resolve the class by name in the context of the project.\n\nAlternatively, note that the function `get_class_info` has an optional `module_name` but `get_signature` does not. So we are relying on the class being uniquely identifiable by name? \n\nBut the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n\nWe are not given the module name for `AbstractCellHandler`. However, the function `get_signature` does not have a parameter for module. So we cannot specify it. Therefore, we must call without module.\n\nWe'll proceed with the calls.\n\nWe are going to make three function calls in total? But note: the system expects one or more function calls in the same <functions> block.\n\nWe can do:\n\n<functions>\n   <function name=\"get_relevant_classes\">\n      <param name=\"search_string\" type=\"string\">CellResult</param>\n      <param name=\"include_subdirectories\" type=\"boolean\">true</param>\n   </function>\n   <function name=\"get_signature\">\n      <param name=\"class_name\" type=\"string\">AbstractCellHandler</param>\n      <param name=\"method_name\" type=\"string\">setCellValue</param>\n   </function>\n   <function name=\"get_signature\">\n      <param name=\"class_name\" type=\"string\">AbstractCellHandler</param>\n      <param name=\"method_name\" type=\"string\">getCellValue</param>\n   </function>\n</functions>\n\nBut note: the function `get_relevant_classes` has a parameter `case_sensitive` which we are not setting because we want the default (false). Similarly, for `get_signature`, we are not setting `include_private` because the default (false) is what we want.\n\nLet's write the XML accordingly."}

We just use the numeric value.\n\n For the second part, we can use the function `get_current_weather` which requires:\n    - `location` (str): We are to get the weather for \"Queenstown, Singapore\". We format it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\n However, note that the function `get_current_weather` also has an optional parameter `unit` which defaults to 'fahrenheit'. \n    Since the user did not specify the unit, we can either use the default or choose one. The problem says the user's question lacks parameters? \n    But in this case, the user didn't specify the unit for weather. Since the function has a default, we can omit the `unit` parameter and let it use the default, \n    or we can choose a unit that is appropriate for the location. However, the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. \n    But note: the function doesn't require `unit` because it has a default. So we can call without it.\n\n But note: the user did not specify the unit for weather.

The user input was in cm, so the area will be in cm\u00b2, but that is not part of the function call.\n\n However, note: the function `get_area_of_square` expects a float for `size`.

The parameter event_type is a string, so we cannot pass multiple types.\n\n Alternatively, we can call once with event_type as 'concert' and once as 'theater'? But the user said \"music concerts\" and \"theater plays\".\n The function's event_type parameter: what are the allowed values? The docstring doesn't specify, but we have to assume it accepts standard terms.\n\n Since the user says \"any\", we might need to do two separate searches?

Search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA (with no specific requirement on unisex, so we can use default for is_unisex).\n 2. Book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\n We have two functions that can be used:\n - Services_1_FindProvider: to search for a hair stylist in a city.\n - Services_1_BookAppointment: to book an appointment.\n\n However, note that the user's request is to:\n   a) search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA (without specifying unisex, so we can leave is_unisex as default)\n   b) book an appointment with a specific salon (Elegant Styles) at a specific time and date.\n\n We can break this into two function calls.\n\n Steps:\n 1. First, we need to search for hair stylists in Sunnyvale, CA. This is to fulfill the first part of the request.\n    - We call Services_1_FindProvider with city='Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex can be omitted (since the function has a default of 'dontcare').\n\n 2. Then, we book an appointment with the salon named 'Elegant Styles' at the given time and date.\n    - We call Services_1_BookAppointment with stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10'.\n\n However, note that the user did not specify a stylist's full name but the salon name. The function for booking requires the stylist's full name OR the salon name. Since the function's description says \"stylist_name (str): The full name of the hair stylist or the name of the salon\", we can use the salon name.\n\n But note: the user wrote 'Elegant Styles' (with one 'g') but in the request it's written as 'Elegant Styles' (with two 'g's? Actually, the user wrote: \"Elegant Styles\" (with one 'g') in the question. We'll use exactly what the user said: 'Elegant Styles'\n\n Important: The function for booking does not require the city because it's booking by the stylist/salon name and the time/date. However, the search function is only for finding providers in a city. The booking function doesn't take location because it assumes the stylist/salon name is unique enough? But note, the user might have multiple salons with the same name in different cities. However, the function doesn't have a city parameter. So we assume that the salon name is unique or that the system can handle it without the city.\n\n Since the user's request is to book with a specific salon name, we proceed with the booking.\n\n Therefore, we make two function calls.\n\n Format:\n We must output the function calls in the specified XML format.\n\n First function: Services_1_FindProvider\n   - city: \"Sunnyvale, CA\" (string)\n   - is_unisex: we can skip because it has a default. But note, the function has a default of 'dontcare'. However, the function expects a boolean or 'dontcare'. Since we are not specifying, we can omit the parameter? But the instruction says: if the function has a default and we are using the default, we can skip the parameter.\n\n But the problem: the function definition in the docstring says:\n   is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare'): ... \n\n However, in the XML format, we are required to put the parameters. But note: the instruction says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" but we have the city and the is_unisex is optional.\n\n Since we are allowed to skip optional parameters, we can just provide the city.\n\n Second function: Services_1_BookAppointment\n   - stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\" (but note: the user wrote 'Elegant Styles'? Actually, the user wrote: 'Elegant Styles' -> wait, the user said: 'Elegant Styles'? Let me check: \"book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon\" -> the user wrote \"Elegant\" with one 'g'. So we use \"Elegant Styles\".\n\n However, note: the user might have meant \"Elegant\" (with two 'g's) but we have to go by what they typed.\n\n So:\n   stylist_name: \"Elegant Styles\"\n   appointment_time: \"15:00\"\n   appointment_date: \"2023-05-10\"\n\n We output both function calls in the same <functions> block.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and we are allowed to output multiple function calls.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"Services_1_FindProvider\">\n    <param name=\"city\" type=\"string\">Sunnyvale, CA</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"Services_1_BookAppointment\">\n    <param name=\"stylist_name\" type=\"string\">Elegant Styles</param>\n    <param name=\"appointment_time\" type=\"string\">15:00</param>\n    <param name=\"appointment_date\" type=\"string\">2023-05-10</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n However, note: the user didn't specify the state abbreviation for Sunnyvale? They said \"Sunnyvale, CA\" which is the short form. So that's acceptable.\n\n But wait: the function Services_1_FindProvider expects the city in the format: 'City, State (abbr)' and the example is 'New York, NY'. We have provided 'Sunnyvale, CA' which matches.\n\n Also, the booking function: the time is in 24-hour format (15:00) and the date is in YYYY-MM-DD (2023-05-10). Correct.\n\n However, note: the user's request is to \"search for a hair stylist\" and then book. The search might be necessary to confirm that Elegant Styles is in Sunnyvale? But the booking function doesn't take location. So if the system has a global booking without location, that might be okay. But the user didn't ask to check if Elegant Styles is in Sunnyvale. They just asked to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale (which might return multiple) and then book with a specific salon. We are doing both.\n\n But note: the booking function doesn't require the city. So we are booking without specifying the city. This might be a problem if there are multiple Elegant Styles. However, the function does not have a city parameter, so we cannot specify. We must rely on the function's design.\n\n Since we are following the user's request, we proceed.\n\n Therefore, the function calls are as above.\n\n However, note: the function Services_1_FindProvider does not return any information that is used by the booking function. We are just doing two independent actions. That's acceptable because the user asked for two things.\n\n Let's write the XML accordingly."}
