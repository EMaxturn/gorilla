First, I need to check the available functions. The function 'uber.ride' requires loc, type, and time. The loc is given as a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The user's address is 123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704. Wait, the example in the function uses 'Address, City, State' but the user provided a ZIP code as well.

But the example includes the state, so maybe the user's input should be formatted as '123 \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc Street, Berkeley, CA' but the user wrote '\u0110\u01b0\u1eddng' which is 'Street' in Vietnamese. So the loc parameter should be '123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704'? Wait, the function's description says the loc is in the format 'Address, City, State', but the example includes the state. However, the user's address includes a ZIP code. But the function's parameters don't specify that ZIP codes are allowed. Maybe the user's input is correct as is. The type is 'plus' as per the user's request. The time is 10 minutes. So the parameters are loc='123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704', type='plus', time=10. The function should be called with these parameters. I need to make sure that the loc is correctly formatted. The user's address includes the ZIP code, but the function's example doesn't have that.

The available function is get_movies, which requires the city parameter. The user specified Mumbai as the city, so that's covered. The date is mentioned as \"today,\" so I need to set the movie_date to today's date in India. Since the function's default for movie_date is the current date, but the user explicitly said \"today,\" I should confirm that. The parameters for the function include city, cinema_hall (optional), movie_date (optional with default), movie_language (optional), and movie_format (optional, default 2D). The user didn't mention cinema hall, language, or format, so those can be left as default. Therefore, the function call should be get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date. Wait, but the function's default for movie_date is None, but the description says the default is the current date. Wait, looking back: the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says \"Default is the current date.\" Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. The function's parameters say the default is None, but the description says the default is the current date. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says \"Default is the current date.\" That might be a mistake in the function's documentation. But according to the parameters, the default is None, but the description says it's the current date. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says \"Default is the current date.\" So maybe the function actually uses the current date if not provided. But the user is asking for today, so maybe we should set it explicitly. However, since the function's default is the current date, maybe it's okay to omit it. But the user said \"today,\" so perhaps it's better to include it to be explicit. Wait, the system note says to consider the current date as today in India. So the function's default for movie_date is the current date. Therefore, even if the user says \"today,\" the function will use the current date. So the function call would be get_movies(city='Mumbai'). But the user might be in a time zone where today is different, but the system is set to India's time. So the correct call is get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date as today's date. But since the function's default is the current date, maybe we can omit movie_date. However, the user explicitly said \"today,\" so including it would be better. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says the default is the current date. That's conflicting. Maybe the function is designed to use the current date if not provided. So the correct call is get_movies(city='Mumbai'). But to be safe, since the user mentioned \"today,\" perhaps include movie_date. But how to get today's date in India? The system note says to calculate it as today's date in India. So the function will handle that. Therefore, the function call is get_movies(city='Mumbai'). The other parameters are optional and not provided, so they can be left out. So the final answer is to call get_movies with city='Mumbai'."}

The function provided is getDataForProfessional. The parameters required are service_id, province_id, and optionally district_name, sub_district_name, rating, etc.\n\nThe service type is ironing, which according to the enum in the function is service_id 2. Province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district is Sankampang, and the sub-district is Ton Pao. The rating needed is 4.5. \n\nSo I need to map these details into the function parameters. The required parameters are service_id and province_id, which are 2 and 2 respectively. Then, district_name is Sankampang, sub_district_name is Ton Pao, and rating is 4.5. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't specified, so they can be left as default. Also, has_late_check_in is optional and defaults to False, which is acceptable unless the user specifies otherwise. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention availability dates, so those can be omitted. The function allows for optional parameters, so including district and sub-district names, along with the rating should narrow down the search. \n\nI should make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The service_id is 2, province_id is 2, district_name is \"Sankampang\", sub_district_name is \"Ton Pao\", and rating is 4.5. That should cover the user's request. Let me double-check the function's parameters to ensure I didn't miss anything. Yes, those are all the necessary parameters. So the function call should include those values."}
