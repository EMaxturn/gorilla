Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the final speed. The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for distance and time are specified as integers.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they are the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they are the same gas, the formula simplifies.\n\nThe formula is: (quantity1 * temperature1) + (quantity2 * temperature2) = (quantity1 + quantity2) * final_temperature. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (2 * 300) + (3 * 400) = (2 + 3) * T. Calculating the left side: 600 + 1200 = 1800. Then 1800 divided by 5 (since 2+3=5) gives 360 K. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2.

So I need to call sort_list with elements as the list and order as 'asc'. \n\nWait, the parameters: the elements are the list, and order is a string. The user's request is straightforward.

So the desired_sum is 7, n_rolls is 2, and sides_per_die is 6. I need to make sure all parameters are provided. The user didn't specify any other details, so I can use the defaults for the other parameters. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, and sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the default for sides_per_die is 6, so maybe it's optional. But since the user is talking about standard dice, it's safe to include it. Let me confirm the function's parameters again. The function's args are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int, default 1), sides_per_die (int, default 6). So in this case, desired_sum is 7, n_rolls is 2, and sides_per_die is 6.

So I need to call this function with company=\"Apple Inc\", years=5, and frequency=\"annually\" (though frequency is optional, maybe include it to be explicit).\n\nWait, the function's frequency parameter has a default of annually, so maybe it's not necessary to specify it.
