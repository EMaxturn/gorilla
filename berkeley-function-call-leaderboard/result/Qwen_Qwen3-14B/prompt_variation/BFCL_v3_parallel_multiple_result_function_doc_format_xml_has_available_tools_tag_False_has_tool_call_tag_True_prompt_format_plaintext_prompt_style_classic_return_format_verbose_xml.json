The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it retrieves the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size as an array. \n\nFor the first sculpture: Philadelphia, marble, size [4,4]. For the second: New York, bronze, size [6,3]. So I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each sculpture. But the function's parameters don't include sculpture_id, so maybe it's using material and size to determine the price. However, the problem is that the user is asking for the average of two different sculptures. But the function might not return the average; it might return the price of a single sculpture based on those parameters. Wait, the function's description says \"price of a sculpture based on size and material,\" so maybe each call gives the price for one sculpture. Then, the user wants the average of these two prices. \n\nBut the functions available don't have a way to calculate an average. The user would need to get each price individually and then compute the average. So first, call get_artwork_price for the marble statue in Philadelphia with size [4,4], then for the bronze in New York with [6,3]. Then, take those two prices, add them, and divide by two. However, the functions don't do the average; they just retrieve the price for each. So the assistant would need to make two function calls, get both prices, and then compute the average. But since the functions can't do that, the answer would be to call both functions and then calculate the average manually. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the average price of these two specific sculptures. So the steps are: get the price of each sculpture using get_artwork_price, then compute the average. However, the functions don't have a way to return the average directly. So the assistant needs to make two separate calls. \n\nBut the problem is that the user might not have provided all the parameters. Wait, the get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user provided all these for both sculptures. So the first call would be museum_location: Philadelphia, sculpture_material: marble, sculpture_size: [4,4]. The second call: museum_location: New York, sculpture_material: bronze, sculpture_size: [6,3]. \n\nSo the assistant should make two function calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then compute the average. Since the functions can't do that, the answer would be to call both functions and then calculate the average. Therefore, the correct tool calls are two instances of get_artwork_price with the respective parameters."}

The user has three parts to solve. \n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The energy per mole is given as 2800 kJ/mol. So I should use the biological.calc_energy function here. The parameters required are mols and substance. The mols are 5, and the substance is C6H12O6. The joules_per_mol is already provided, so I can include that as well.\n\nNext, using the total energy from the first step, I need to calculate the biomass produced with a 10% efficiency. The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. Since efficiency is 10%, which is 0.10 as a float, I'll use that.\n\nThird, the work done by the machine moving 2 meters. The physical.calc_work function requires energy and distance. The energy here is the same total energy from the first step, and the distance is 2 meters. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance\". So for the work calculation, the energy input is the total energy from the bacteria, which is the same as the first step. So I need to call calc_work with that energy and distance 2.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called in order. Let me check the parameters again. For calc_energy, mols is 5, substance is \"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol is 2800. Then calc_biomass uses the energy from calc_energy and efficiency 0.10. Then calc_work uses the same energy from calc_energy and distance 2. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So three function calls in sequence."}

Wait, the future_value function's time parameter is described as \"number of time periods the money is invested for.\" But the third option's time is 6 years. However, the num_compoundings is twice a year, so maybe the time here is in years, and num_compoundings is 2. The interest rate is 5%, which as a decimal is 0.05.

But the functions can be called in any order as they are independent. However, the user's question asks for the new attributes, the prediction, and the probability. So all three functions need to be called."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco. The details given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985, and location San Francisco. The function predict_house_price requires all these parameters, so I'll need to call that first.\n\nNext, they want to check lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. Since the user specified San Francisco county and California is the default state, I'll use that. So I'll call lawsuit_search with entity John Doe, county San Francisco, and state California.\n\nLastly, the probability of winning a lottery with 1000 total outcomes and 5 favorable ones, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function can handle this. The parameters are total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3. That should give the probability as 0.005 when rounded.\n\nI need to make sure all three functions are called with the correct parameters. Let me double-check each parameter for each function to ensure they match the user's request. Everything seems to line up. No missing parameters here. Alright, time to structure the tool calls."}

The user has four separate requests here. First, they want to know the collectable fish in Animal Crossing during Summer. The function get_collectables_in_season seems right for that. I need to specify the game name as 'Animal Crossing', season as 'Summer', and item_type as 'fish'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in Fortnite on Playstation in Asia. The game_score.highest function can handle that. Parameters would be game 'Fortnite', platform 'Playstation', and region 'Asia'.\n\nThen, lawsuits involving Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function is the one to use here. Company name 'Apple Inc.', year 2018. Case_type isn't specified, so leave it out.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials=10, number_of_successes=3, probability_of_success=0.7.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included and types are correct. Each function call should be separate. Let me check each one again to confirm."}
