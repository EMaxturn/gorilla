User said 6 seconds.\n\n- acceleration: Defaults to -9.81 m/s\u00b2, which is perfect for an object under gravity.\n\nThe function description says: \"The acceleration of the object in m/s^2. Default value is -9.81 (Earth's gravity)\". So, I don't need to specify it if it's Earth's gravity, which it is.\n\nRequired parameters: initial_velocity and time. I have both.\n\nSo, I can call: kinematics.final_velocity(initial_velocity=40, time=6)\n\nThe initial velocity is 40 m/s upward. In physics, we often take upward as positive, so initial_velocity should be +40 m/s, and acceleration is -9.81 m/s\u00b2 downward.\n\nThat matches the default.\n\nI should only return the function call in the specified format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nOnce I make this call, if that's all that's needed, the system will handle the rest.

The user says \"tomorrow, June01 2023\", which might mean they want the UV index for June 01, 2023, assuming that's tomorrow.\n\nTo be precise, I should use the date they mentioned: June 01, 2023.\n\nSo, location: Tokyo\n\nDate: 06-01-2023 (in mm-dd-yyyy format)\n\nI can call the function: uv_index.get_future(location=\"Tokyo\", date=\"06-01-2023\")\n\nMy response should only be in the <TOOLCALL> format if I'm making a call. I need to put it exactly as specified.\n\nOnce I make this call, if that's all, the system will handle the rest. The instructions say: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nFor this query, calling uv_index.get_future should fulfill it.\n\nFinally, format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for this: <TOOLCALL>[uv_index.get_future(location='Tokyo', date='06-01-2023')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should ensure the date is correctly formatted. The user said \"June01 2023\", which is not in the required format, but I'm converting it.\n\nIs there any uncertainty? The user said \"tomorrow\", but specified the date, so I'll go with that."}

But it only has categories 'vegan' and 'gluten-free'. The user asked for 'vegetarian' and 'gluten-free'.\n\nThe categories available in the tools are only ['vegan', 'gluten-free']. There's no 'vegetarian' option.\n\nThe function for Walmart is 'walmart.vegan_products', and its parameters allow categories: an array of ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nVegetarian is not the same as vegan. Vegan means no animal products at all, while vegetarian might include dairy and eggs. But the tool doesn't have a 'vegetarian' category; it only has 'vegan'.\n\nThe user said \"vegetarian and gluten-free\". I need to check if I can use the tools as they are.\n\nFor 'walmart.vegan_products', I can specify categories like ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], which would give products that are both vegan and gluten-free.\n\nBut the user asked for vegetarian and gluten-free, not vegan.\n\nIs there a way to interpret this? The tools don't have a direct match for vegetarian.\n\nThe description says: \"Product categories to search within. Default empty array\" and the enum is only ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nSo, I can't specify 'vegetarian' because it's not in the enum.\n\nMy options:\n\n- I could call 'walmart.vegan_products' with categories ['gluten-free'], but that wouldn't cover vegetarian.\n\n- Or with ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], which would give vegan and gluten-free products, a subset of vegetarian and gluten-free.\n\n- But that's not exactly what the user asked.\n\nThe tool is named 'vegan_products', but it allows specifying categories, which include 'vegan' and 'gluten-free'.\n\nPerhaps the function can return products that match the specified categories.\n\nSince 'vegetarian' isn't an option, I might need to explain that I can't fulfill the request exactly.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nIn the response format, I should only return the function calls in <TOOLCALL>, or if not, return an empty list and explain.\n\nThe exact instruction: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[...]</TOOLCALL>. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nAnd: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nIf I can't call any function, I should return an empty list and explain, but the prompt says: \"return an empty list then explain.\" However, in the response format, it might mean to include it in the <TOOLCALL> or something? No, it says: \"If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nLooking back: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nIn the response section: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing. It says to return an empty list and explain, but also to only include the TOOLCALL in the response.\n\nPerhaps I need to output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> or something, but the prompt doesn't specify exactly.\n\nThe prompt says: \"return an empty list then explain.\" and later \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" This might be contradictory.\n\nReading carefully: \"If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\" But then it says for the response: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nI think the intention is that if I'm not making a tool call, I should just explain, but the prompt says to put function calls in <TOOLCALL>, and if not, perhaps output nothing or follow the instruction.\n\nThe very first part: \"You need to make function/tool calls to solve the question given. If none of the functions can be used... return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nAnd then: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nTo reconcile, if I'm not making a call, I should output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> or something, but it doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps in practice, for this system, if no call, I output the explanation, but the prompt says \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response\" which is for when you do make calls.\n\nThis is ambiguous, but I think for no calls, I need to return an empty list in the TOOLCALL format.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), ...]</TOOLCALL>.\"\n\nImplying that if not, don't use that format.\n\nBut then it says \"return an empty list then explain\", so perhaps output something like: [] and then explain.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that if no functions, I output <TOOLCALL>[]</TOOLCALL> or just the explanation, but the prompt says \"return an empty list then explain\", and since the response should be clean, perhaps I need to output the explanation only if no TOOLCALL.\n\nThe system might handle it.\n\nAnother way: the prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed.\"\n\nSo, for this, since I can't call any function exactly, I should not make a call and explain.\n\nBut to follow strictly, I'll check if I can make a partial call.\n\nPerhaps I can call 'walmart.vegan_products' with ['gluten-free'], as it's the only matching category, and note that vegetarian isn't available.\n\nThe user asked for both.\n\nSince the tool has 'vegan', and vegan is a type of vegetarian, I could call with ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], which would give products that are vegan and gluten-free, which are also vegetarian and gluten-free.\n\nThat might be the best I can do.\n\nThe tool is for 'vegan_products', so it might return vegan products.\n\nLet's look at the description: \"Get available vegan products at specified Walmart store\" and then it allows categories ['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nSo, if I specify ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], it should return products that are vegan and gluten-free.\n\nSince vegan products are vegetarian, this might satisfy the request partially.\n\nI think that's the closest I can get.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with calling 'walmart.vegan_products' with location='Denver, CO' and categories=['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nThe user said \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", not \"vegan and gluten-free\".\n\nHowever, since 'vegetarian' isn't an option, this is the best match.\n\nIf I don't call anything, I can't help at all.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\nLocation: The user said \"near Denver\", so I'll use 'Denver, CO' as in the example.\n\nFinal decision: Call 'walmart.vegan_products' with location='Denver, CO' and categories=['vegan', 'gluten-free'].\n\nOutput in the specified format."}
