There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user specified \"Caesar salad without anchovies\". The ChaFod function requires foodItem, and optionally newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients mentioned, so that's empty. Special instructions might not be needed here since it's just removing an ingredient. So I'll call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user mentions updating order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences as a dict. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences include \"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\". So new_preferences should be a dictionary with those keys. I'll structure that into the function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function clone_repo requires repo_url and maybe destination. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default, which is the current directory. So I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents needs the directory_name. The repo is cloned into the current directory, so the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or the default directory. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination is default '.', so the repo will be in a directory named after the repo. But the exact directory name might be 'nodejs-welcome' if the default is used. But maybe the user expects the directory name to be the repo's name. Let me assume the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, based on the analysis, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_a_docker_file function needs directory_name. So again, using the same directory name. Then create_kubernetes_yaml_file also needs directory_name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name, then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name and default parameters.\n\nAfter creating those files, the next step is to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user didn't specify the message or branch, so use defaults. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and default parameters.\n\nWait, but the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The function push_git_changes_to_github automatically git add all changes. So that's covered. \n\nSo the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, push. Each function call in order. Let me check if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is needed. Assuming the cloned repo is in a directory named 'nodejs-welcome', which is the default. Then the rest follow. So the function calls should be in that order."}

The function get_relevant_classes seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True. The search_string would be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. I'll need to call this twice, once for each method. The class_name is AbstractCellHandler, and method_name would be setCellValue and getCellValue respectively. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe include_private is False by default, but since the methods are public, it's safe to assume they're not private.\n\nWait, the user is extending AbstractCellHandler, so those methods should be present there.

There's a function called get_area_of_square that takes a size parameter. The size here is 5 cm, so I should use that function with size=5. The unit is cm, but the function doesn't mention units, so maybe it just needs the numerical value. The function should return the area as size squared, so 5 squared is 25. The unit would be cm\u00b2, but the function might not handle units, just the number.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\"\u2014wait, is Queenstown part of Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format.

The unit parameter is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit. The user didn't specify, so maybe use the default. \n\nWait, but the user might be confused if Queenstown is a city in Singapore. Let me check. Yes, Queenstown is a suburb in Singapore. So the location parameter should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". \n\nSo I need to call both functions. The first function is get_area_of_square with size=5, and the second is get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\" and unit=fahrenheit (though unit is optional). \n\nWait, the user might have a typo.

Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"music concert\" or \"theater play.\" But the function's example uses \"concerts and plays\" as examples, so perhaps the event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play.\" Let me check the function's args again. The event_type is a string, so I can specify each type. So I'll need to call the function twice. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can take multiple types separated by commas. But the parameter is a string, so maybe the function expects a single type.

Alternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"music\" or \"theater.\" But the user mentioned \"music concerts\" and \"theater plays,\" so perhaps \"concert\" and \"play\" are the correct types. \n\nSo, first, call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type=\"concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\". Then, another call with event_type=\"play\", same city and date. But the user might want both in one go. However, the function can only be called once per turn. Wait, the user's instruction says to make one or more function calls. So in this case, the assistant can make two function calls. But the user's question is to find any music concerts or theater plays, so combining both types. However, the function might not support multiple types in one call. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the function twice with each event type. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a list, but the parameter is a string. So the assistant should make two separate calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play\" in the same call. But the function's parameters don't specify that.

The Services_1_BookAppointment function requires stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' as the stylist name, time 15:00, and date 2023-05-10. All parameters are there, so I can call BookAppointment with those details.\n\nI need to make sure the date format is correct for the function. The date given is 2023-05-10, which matches 'YYYY-MM-DD', so that's good. The time is in 24-hour format, which fits the appointment_time parameter. \n\nNo issues with missing parameters here. Both functions can be called in sequence. The user didn't mention any other preferences, so no need for additional functions. I'll structure the tool calls accordingly."}
