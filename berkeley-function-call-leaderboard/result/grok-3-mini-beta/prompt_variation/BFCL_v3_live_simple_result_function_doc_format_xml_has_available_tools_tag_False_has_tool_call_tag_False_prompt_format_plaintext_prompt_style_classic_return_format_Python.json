So, I should use 'City, Country' format, which would be 'Shanghai, China'.\n\nThe user specified to use Celsius, so I should pass the unit as \"Celsius\" or whatever the function expects. The description doesn't specify exact values, but typically for weather APIs, it's something like \"metric\" for Celsius or explicitly \"C\".\n\nIn the function description, it just says \"The unit of temperature for the weather report.\" I need to assume what values are acceptable.

'City, Country' if State for the city doesn't exist.\"\n\nBangkok is in Thailand, which is a country, not a state. So, for Bangkok, I should use 'City, Country' format, like 'Bangkok, Thailand'.\n\nThe function is for current weather, but the user said \"what the temperature is going to be\". That might imply future weather, like a forecast. However, the function is specifically for current weather, not forecasts.

The user is asking for \"what the temperature is going to be\", which could be interpreted as future, but in context, it might just mean the upcoming or current temperature.

The name of the city.\n\n  - date: string, optional. In the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

So, April 25th, 2023, should be '2023-04-25'.\n\nThis matches perfectly with the function's requirements. I can call Weather_1_GetWeather with the city and date parameters.\n\nThe response format is strict: I MUST only return the function calls in the specified format, like [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)].\n\nSo, for this, I should output: [Weather_1_GetWeather(city='Foster City', date='2023-04-25')]\n\nI don't need to add any other text.\n\nIs there anything missing?

The name of the city.\n\n  - date: string, optional. In the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If not provided, it uses the current date.\n\nThe user specified \"Rutherford, NJ\", which includes the city and state. I need to see if the function accepts that. The parameter is just \"city\", so I'll assume \"Rutherford, NJ\" can be passed as the city string.\n\nThe date given is \"April 22nd 2023\". I need to convert this to the required format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n\nSo, April 22nd 2023 should be '2023-04-22'.\n\nThis matches the function's requirements:\n\n- city: \"Rutherford, NJ\"\n\n- date: \"2023-04-22\"\n\nI can make a function call to Weather_1_GetWeather with these parameters.\n\nMy response should only include the function call in the specified format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [Weather_1_GetWeather(city=\"Rutherford, NJ\", date=\"2023-04-22\")]\n\nThat seems straightforward.
