Given the function available, `lawsuit_search`, it seems appropriate for this task. However, I need to ensure that all required parameters are provided and in the correct format.\n\nThe function `lawsuit_search` requires the following parameters:\n\n- `company` (string, required): The company related to the lawsuit.\n\n- `start_date` (string, required): Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed in the format MM-DD-YYYY.\n\n- `location` (string, required): Location where the lawsuit was filed in the format of the full state name.\n\n- `status` (string, optional): The status of the lawsuit. Default is 'ongoing'.\n\nGiven the user's request:\n\n- Company: Google\n\n- Start date: After January 1, 2021. So, start_date should be 01-01-2021.\n\n- Location: California\n\n- Status: Ongoing (as specified)\n\nI need to format the start date correctly. The user provided \"after January 1, 2021\", which implies that the start date should be January 1, 2021, and the search should include lawsuits filed on or after that date.\n\nTherefore, the function call should be:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"lawsuit_search\",\"parameters\":{\"company\":\"Google\",\"start_date\":\"01-01-2021\",\"location\":\"California\",\"status\":\"ongoing\"}}]\n```\n\nHowever, I should confirm if the date format is strictly MM-DD-YYYY. In the user's request, it's \"January 1, 2021\", which is in Month-Day-Year format. In the function definition, it's specified as MM-DD-YYYY, which is Month-Day-Year, matching the user's input.\n\nAdditionally, the location is specified as the full state name, which in this case is \"California\", which matches the required format.\n\nThe status is optional, and since the user specified \"ongoing\", which is also the default, I could omit it. However, to be explicit, I'll include it.\n\nBut wait, the user said \"after January 1, 2021\", which might imply excluding January 1, 2021, itself. However, in legal searches, dates often include the start date unless specified otherwise. To be precise, I should confirm whether to include or exclude January 1, 2021.\n\nGiven that, I might need to adjust the start date accordingly. If the search includes the start date, but the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, then I should set the start date to January 2, 2021.\n\nAlternatively, since the function's start_date parameter includes the start date, and the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, I should set the start_date to 01-01-2021 if the search includes that date, or 01-02-2021 if it doesn't.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume that the start_date includes the date specified. Therefore, setting start_date to 01-01-2021 will include lawsuits filed on January 1, 2021, and after.\n\nBut to be absolutely clear, I should confirm whether the user wants to include January 1, 2021, or start from January 2, 2021.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to set the start_date to 01-02-2021 to ensure that only lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, are included.\n\nHowever, since the user specifically said \"after January 1, 2021\", which could be interpreted as excluding January 1, 2021, I'll set the start_date to 01-02-2021.\n\nTherefore, the function call should be:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"lawsuit_search\",\"parameters\":{\"company\":\"Google\",\"start_date\":\"01-02-2021\",\"location\":\"California\",\"status\":\"ongoing\"}}]\n```\n\nBut to double-check, I need to confirm the inclusive nature of the start_date parameter in the `lawsuit_search` function.\n\nAssuming that start_date is inclusive, meaning it includes lawsuits filed on that date, then setting start_date to 01-01-2021 would include January 1, 2021, and later.\n\nSince the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, which typically means excluding January 1, 2021, I should set start_date to 01-02-2021.\n\nAlternatively, if start_date is exclusive, then setting it to 01-01-2021 would start from January 2, 2021.\n\nGiven the potential for confusion, and since the function's description specifies that start_date is the start of the date range, likely inclusive, I'll proceed with start_date as 01-02-2021 to ensure that only lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, are included.\n\nTherefore, the final function call is:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"lawsuit_search\",\"parameters\":{\"company\":\"Google\",\"start_date\":\"01-02-2021\",\"location\":\"California\",\"status\":\"ongoing\"}}]\n```\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo search for ongoing lawsuits related to the company 'Google' filed after January 1, 2021, in California, you can use the `lawsuit_search` function with the following parameters:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"lawsuit_search\",\"parameters\":{\"company\":\"Google\",\"start_date\":\"01-02-2021\",\"location\":\"California\",\"status\":\"ongoing\"}}]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **Company**: Set to \"Google\" as specified by the user.\n- **Start Date**: Set to \"01-02-2021\" to ensure that only lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, are included.

{"id": "simple_380", "result": "I need to book a hotel room for my trip. I want a single room that's pet friendly, located near Manhattan in New York. I'll be staying for three nights starting from March 10th, 2023. I think I should use the hotel_booking function for this.\n\nLooking at the function parameters:\n\n- location: That's easy, it's New York.\n\n- room_type: I need a single room.\n\n- duration: 3 nights.\n\n- start_date: March 10th, 2023.\n\n- preferences: This is optional, but since I need a pet-friendly hotel, I should include that as a preference.\n\nSo, I need to set the location to \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type to \"single\", duration to 3, start_date to \"2023-03-10\", and preferences to [\"pet friendly\"].\n\nWait, the preferences parameter is an array, so I need to pass it as a list. Make sure to format it correctly.\n\nAlso, confirm the date format. The function likely expects it in YYYY-MM-DD format, so \"2023-03-10\" should be fine.\n\nLet me double-check the location. Since it's near Manhattan, New York, I can specify \"Manhattan, New York\" for the location.\n\nDo I have any other preferences? For now, pet friendly is the main one. If I think of others later, I can maybe adjust, but for now, this should suffice.\n\nI think I have all the information needed to make the function call.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo book a hotel room as per the user's request, we need to utilize the `hotel_booking` function with the specified parameters.
