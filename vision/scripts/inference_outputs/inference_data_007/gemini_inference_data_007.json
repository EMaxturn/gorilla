The event is breaking, which debuts at these games. My next step involves pinpointing the athlete's name and then searching for her final ranking in the competition.

The challenge lies in finding the exact position among those eliminated at the round-robin stage. Examining Final Standings I've located the final standings section on the Wikipedia page. The list clearly indicates Raygun was seeded 15th and eliminated in the group stage. Therefore, her final ranking is 15th out of 16 competitors. I can now confidently provide the precise answer to the user. Discovering Raygun's Rank I've successfully identified Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn's final position. After verifying her identity and event, the official Olympics website provided definitive results. Examining the \"Paris 2024 Breaking B-Girls Results\" list, I pinpointed \"AUS.
