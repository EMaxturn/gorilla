I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nFor uber.ride, the parameters required are loc (string), type (string), and time (integer). The loc needs to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format. The user's address is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. All required parameters are present here.\n\nUber.ride2 also requires loc, type, and time (optional). But the loc format for ride2 is 'City, State', but the user provided a full address. So ride2 might not be suitable because the loc parameter here is a full address, not just city and state. Also, the time is optional in ride2, but the user specified 10 minutes, so that's okay. However, since ride has the correct parameters and the loc format matches, it's better to use uber.ride.\n\nSo the correct function call is uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'Plus', and time 10."}

The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help. The BankStatementOverView function seems right for the overview. It requires bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided most of these: bank is U.S. Bank, account number is given, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview is a summary, which might come from another function.\n\nBut the user also mentioned total deposits, withdrawals, and balances. The TotalTransactions.calculate function could compute those, but the user already provided the totals. However, the transaction_summary.generate function might be needed to generate the detailed summary. Wait, the user wants a summary of transactions, which includes individual transactions and totals. But the user hasn't provided the list of transactions, only the totals. \n\nWait, the user says \"there were other deposits totaling...\" and \"withdrawals amounting to...\", but they didn't list individual transactions. So maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve the list of transactions for the period. The Alltransactions function takes a statement period (YYYY-MM) and include_pending. The period here is 2019-10. But the user might need to retrieve those transactions first.\n\nBut the user is asking for an overview that includes the summary. So maybe first, use Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019. Then use transaction_summary.generate with those transactions and the provided totals. However, the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so maybe the Alltransactions function is needed to get them. But the user hasn't given the parameters to call Alltransactions yet. Wait, the user's question is to provide the overview, which includes the summary. So perhaps the assistant needs to call Alltransactions first to get the transactions, then use that data in transaction_summary.generate. But the user hasn't provided the necessary parameters for Alltransactions, like the statement_period. Wait, the user's question includes the statement period as October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The statement_period for Alltransactions is in 'YYYY-MM' format, so 2019-10. So the assistant can call Alltransactions with statement_period=2019-10 and include_pending=false (assuming pending transactions aren't needed here). Then, once the transactions are retrieved, use transaction_summary.generate with those transactions, the dates, totals, and customer info. But the user hasn't provided the customer's first and last name, which are required for transaction_summary.generate. Wait, the user's account is under the name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which might be the company name. The collect_customer_names function might be needed to get the customer's full name, but the user hasn't provided first and last names. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView function can be called directly with the provided data, and the transaction_overview is a summary that includes the totals. But the transaction_overview parameter for BankStatementOverView is a dict, which the user hasn't provided. The user provided total deposits, withdrawals, and balances. Maybe the assistant can construct the transaction_overview as a dict with those values. Let me check the parameters for BankStatementOverView: it needs transaction_overview as a dict. So perhaps the assistant can create that dict with the totals provided. Then, call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and the constructed transaction_overview. But the user also wants a summary of transactions, which might be part of the transaction_overview. Alternatively, the transaction_summary.generate function might be needed, but that requires the list of transactions. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the assistant can't generate it without first retrieving the transactions via Alltransactions. However, the user's question is to provide the overview, which includes the summary. So the steps would be: 1. Use Alltransactions to get the list of transactions for 2019-10. 2. Use transaction_summary.generate with those transactions, the dates, totals, and customer info. But the customer info (first, last, middle names, company name) isn't provided. The user mentioned the account is under SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which might be the company name. The collect_customer_names function requires first and last names. Since the user hasn't provided those, maybe the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the company name is sufficient, and the customer's name is not needed. But the transaction_summary.generate requires first and last names. This is a problem. The user hasn't provided the customer's name, so the assistant can't call transaction_summary.generate. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that they need to provide the customer's name. However, the user might be the customer, and the account is under their company name. Maybe the assistant can assume that the full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, but that's the account name, not the customer's name. This is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed with the BankStatementOverView function, using the provided data, and the transaction_overview as a summary of the totals. Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView requires transaction_overview as a dict. The user provided total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. So the assistant can create a transaction_overview like: {\"total_deposits\": 7132.76, \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40, \"starting_balance\": 5532.01, \"ending_balance\": 6737.37, \"total_transactions\": ...} but the exact structure isn't specified. However, the user might expect that the overview includes these totals. So the assistant can call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and the constructed transaction_overview. But the user also asked for a summary of transactions, which might be part of the transaction_overview. Alternatively, the assistant might need to call Alltransactions to get the individual transactions and then use that in the summary. But without the customer's name, the transaction_summary.generate can't be called. This is a bit of a dead end. Given the information provided, the assistant can call BankStatementOverView with the available data, even if the transaction_overview is a simplified summary. So the function calls would be: 1. Alltransactions to get the transactions for 2019-10. 2. Then, use those transactions in transaction_summary.generate, but since the customer's name is missing, that might not be possible. Alternatively, the assistant can proceed with the BankStatementOverView function, using the provided totals as the transaction_overview. So the final answer would involve calling BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and a constructed transaction_overview."}

So it's optional. The user didn't specify, so maybe we can omit it or set it to true. But the function's description says \"include_tools\" is a flag to determine if tools should be included. Since the user is asking for the tech stack, which typically includes tools, maybe it's safe to include them. However, the function might have a default value. Wait, the parameters don't mention a default, so maybe we need to specify it. But the user didn't mention, so perhaps the function's default is false? Or maybe the function requires it. Wait, the required attribute for include_tools is false, so it's optional. So the function can be called without it. But the user wants the tech stack, which would include languages, frameworks, and tools. If include_tools is not specified, maybe the function defaults to including them. Alternatively, maybe the function includes all by default. But since the parameter is optional, perhaps the user's question doesn't specify, so we can call the function without that parameter. Let me check the function's parameters again. The include_tools is a boolean, required is false. So it's optional. So the function can be called with just the employee_id. The as_of_date is also optional, so we can omit that as well.\n\nSo the correct function call is get_tech_stack with employee_id=\"Adriel\". The other parameters are optional and not specified by the user, so they can be omitted. Therefore, the tool call should be to get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\"."}

The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are FindRestaurants, ReserveRestaurant, and GetRide. Since the user is looking to search for restaurants, FindRestaurants is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for FindRestaurants: category is required, location is required, and there are optional ones like price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which I think corresponds to the price_range parameter. The location is New York, so I need to format that as \"New York, NY\" as per the function's requirement. They also want outdoor seating, so I should set has_seating_outdoors to true. The category isn't specified, but maybe the user didn't mention it. Wait, the function requires the category parameter. Oh, the user didn't specify a cuisine type, so maybe I need to ask for clarification. But the user's message doesn't mention a category. Wait, the function's category is required. Hmm, the user's query says \"tagged as intermediate priced\" but doesn't specify the cuisine category. That's a problem because the category is required. But maybe the user didn't provide it. Wait, the original question says \"restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York.\" So the category isn't mentioned. But the function requires the category. So maybe the user forgot to mention it, or perhaps the category is optional? Let me check the function definition again. No, the category is required. So in this case, the user hasn't provided the category, which is a required parameter. Therefore, I can't call the function without it. But the user might have intended to leave it out. Wait, maybe the category is not necessary here. Wait, the function's description says \"Searches for restaurants based on specified location, category, and other optional preferences.\" So category is required. Therefore, the user's query is missing the category. But the user hasn't provided it. So I need to point out that the required parameter 'category' is missing. However, the user might have intended to search without a specific category, but the function requires it. Alternatively, maybe the category can be left as a general term, but the function requires it. So in this case, the assistant should note that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. However, the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating in New York. Since the category is required, but not provided, the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the 'category' parameter is missing. But wait, maybe the user intended to use a default or general category. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the assistant should not call the function and instead inform the user that the category is missing. However, the user's original question doesn't mention a category. So the answer would be that the required parameter 'category' is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by assuming a general category, but the function requires it. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the category is missing. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. So in this case, the assistant should respond that the 'category' parameter is required but not provided. But the user's message is in the query, so maybe the assistant should make a function call with the available parameters and leave the category as a required field. Wait, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the 'category' parameter is missing. However, the user might have intended to search without a category, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant should not call the function and instead inform the user that the category is missing. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should not call the function. Therefore, the correct answer is to not make a function call and instead indicate that the category is missing. But the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating in New York. The assistant needs to check if the parameters are present. The required parameters for FindRestaurants are category and location. The user provided location as New York, but not category. Therefore, the assistant can't call the function. So the answer is that the required parameter 'category' is missing. However, the user might have intended to leave it out, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant should not make a function call and instead point out the missing parameter. But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should not make a function call.

Therefore, the answer should indicate that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the location in the \"studio sessions\" part, but that's unclear.

The other parameters like artist, genre, and year can be set to 'dontcare' because the user isn't specifying them.

The first one is for initiating a payment request, and the second is for actually making the payment.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe Events_3_FindEvents function seems relevant here. It retrieves cultural events based on event type, city, and date. The parameters required are event_type, city, and optionally date. The user specified \"music concert or a play\" as the event type, so I can use that. The city is New York, and the date is March 10th, which should be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' so '2023-03-10' assuming the current year. \n\nWait, the date parameter in Events_3_FindEvents has a default of 'dontcare' if not specified, but the user wants a specific date. So I need to set the date to '2023-03-10'. The event_type should be 'concert' or 'play', but the user said \"music concert or a play\", so maybe use 'concert' and 'play' as separate types? But the function's event_type is a single string. Maybe the function allows multiple types, but the parameter is required. Hmm, the description says \"category of the cultural event to find\", so perhaps the user can input 'concert' or 'play' as the event_type. Since the user wants either, maybe I should call the function twice, once for each type. But the function might handle multiple types if separated by commas? The parameter's type is string, so maybe it's a single value. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle multiple event types in one call. The user's query says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so perhaps the event_type can be 'concert' and 'play' as separate parameters. But the function only takes one event_type. Maybe the user wants either, so I can first check for concerts and then for plays. However, the function might not support multiple types in one call. So perhaps I need to make two separate calls. But the user might prefer a single call. Alternatively, maybe the event_type can accept multiple values. The parameter's description says \"The category of the cultural event to find.\" So maybe it's a single category. In that case, perhaps the user's request is to find either, so maybe the function can be called with 'concert' first, and if no results, then 'play'. But since the user is asking for both, maybe the assistant should make two separate function calls. However, the user might not have specified which one they want first. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a list, but the parameter is a string. The parameter's type is string, so perhaps it's a single value. Therefore, I should make two separate calls: one for event_type 'concert' and another for 'play', both in New York on March 10th. But the user might want both types in one go. Alternatively, maybe the function allows multiple types separated by commas. The description doesn't specify, but since the parameter is a string, perhaps it's possible. Let me check the function's parameters again. The event_type is a string, required. So maybe the user can input 'concert, play' as the event_type. However, the function's implementation might not support that. But given the information, I'll proceed with using 'concert' as the event_type first, and if needed, call again for 'play'. But the user's query is to find either, so perhaps the best approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as 'concert' and then again with 'play', but since the user might want both, maybe the assistant can make both calls. However, the system might have a limit on the number of function calls. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types. Since the user's message says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", maybe the assistant should first check for concerts and then plays. But given the current setup, I'll proceed to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as 'concert' and then another call with 'play', both in New York on March 10th. However, the user might not want two separate calls. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept multiple types. But without knowing the function's exact capabilities, I'll proceed with the first approach. So the first function call would be Events_3_FindEvents with event_type 'concert', city 'New York, NY', and date '2023-03-10'. Then another call for 'play' with the same parameters. But the user might not have specified the year. The current date is not given, but the user says March 10th. Assuming the current year is 2023, but maybe the user means the current year. However, if the current date is in 2024, that would be incorrect. But since the user didn't specify the year, perhaps the function's date parameter can accept 'YYYY-MM-DD' with the year as the current one. Alternatively, the user might have intended the current year. Since the assistant can't know the current date, but the function requires a date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, the assistant should use the date as provided by the user, which is March 10th. However, the year is missing. The user might have intended the current year, but the assistant can't assume that. Wait, the function's date parameter has a default of 'dontcare' if not specified. But the user specified March 10th, so the assistant must include the date. However, without the year, the date is incomplete. This is a problem. The user's input is \"March 10th\", but the function requires 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The assistant needs to infer the year. If the current date is, say, 2023, then the date would be '2023-03-10'. But since the assistant doesn't have real-time data, it's possible that the user might have intended the current year. However, the assistant can't know that. This is a missing parameter. The user didn't provide the year, so the function call can't be made accurately. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the date is missing the year. But the user might have intended the current year. Alternatively, the assistant can proceed with the assumption that the year is the current one. However, the problem is that the user's input lacks the year, which is required for the function's date parameter. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the date is missing the year. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's message says \"on March 10th\", which is ambiguous. The assistant might need to ask for clarification. But the current task is to generate the function calls based on the given information. Since the user didn't specify the year, the assistant can't proceed with the date parameter. Therefore, the assistant should indicate that the date is missing the year. However, the user might have intended the current year, so the assistant could proceed with that assumption. But the instructions say to point out if parameters are missing. Therefore, the correct approach is to note that the date parameter is missing the year. However, the user might have intended the current year, so the assistant can proceed with that. But since the assistant can't know the current date, this is a problem. Alternatively, the assistant can proceed with the date as '2023-03-10' assuming the current year is 2023. But this is an assumption. Given that, the assistant should proceed with the available information, even if it's an assumption. Therefore, the function call would be Events_3_FindEvents with event_type 'concert', city 'New York, NY', and date '2023-03-10'. Then another call for 'play' with the same parameters. However, the user might have intended a different year. But given the constraints, this is the best possible approach."}

The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles, CA, and departure_date as March 10th, 2023. The date needs to be in MM/DD/YYYY format, so that's 03/10/2023.

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name they provided is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the threshold is 5% error rate, and notifications should go to admin@example.com and support@example.com.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned a global application alert, the create_global_application_alert_config function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (string, required), alert_type (string, required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (boolean, optional). \n\nThe user provided the name, threshold (5%), and recipients. But alert_type is missing. Wait, the threshold is 5% error rate, so maybe the alert_type is something like 'error_rate'? The problem is the user didn't specify the alert_type. However, the function requires it. But the user's question might imply that the alert is for error rate. Maybe the alert_type can be inferred as 'error_rate' based on the threshold description. \n\nAssuming that's acceptable, then the parameters would be: name 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type 'error_rate', threshold 0.05 (since 5% as a float), recipients as an array with the two emails. The enabled parameter is optional, so if not provided, it might default to false or true depending on the system. Since the user didn't mention enabling it, maybe we leave it out or set to true. But the function's enabled parameter is optional, so perhaps the user wants it enabled by default. However, the function's required parameters don't include enabled, so it's okay to omit it. \n\nWait, the user didn't specify whether the alert should be enabled or not. The function has enabled as optional. So the call would include name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. The enabled parameter can be omitted. But the alert_type is required. Since the user mentioned \"error rate threshold\", the alert_type should be 'error_rate' or similar. Since the user didn't specify, but the threshold is 5%, maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate'. \n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The recipients are an array of the two emails. Threshold is 5% which is 0.05 as a float. So that's all the required parameters. The enabled parameter isn't mentioned, so it's optional. Therefore, the function call should be made with the given parameters, assuming alert_type is 'error_rate'."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user ID is given, so I can use that. But the description mentions shareable tokens, which might be a subset of all tokens.\n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function. It has parameters for include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe set include_expired to true. However, the function doesn't mention a user_id parameter. Wait, the parameters listed don't include user_id. That's a problem because the user provided their ID. But the function's parameters don't have a user_id field. Maybe the API uses authentication to determine the user, so the user_id isn't needed here. But the user provided it, so perhaps the first function is the right one. However, the first function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not be all tokens. The second function's description says \"associated with the user's account,\" which sounds more comprehensive. But if the second function doesn't take a user_id, how does it know which user? Maybe the user is authenticated, so the user_id is implied. But the user provided it, so maybe the first function is the one to use. Wait, the user might be confused. Let me check again.\n\nThe first function's parameters require user_id, which the user provided. The second function's parameters don't have user_id. So if the user wants all tokens, maybe the second function is better, but without user_id, perhaps it's not the right one. However, the user might have provided the user ID for the first function. So maybe the correct call is to use the first function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=true to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the second function's parameters don't have user_id, so maybe it's not the right one. Alternatively, maybe the second function is the correct one, but the user_id is handled via authentication. But the user provided the user ID, so perhaps the first function is the one to use. I think the first function is the right choice here. So the function call would be CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=true to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the user said \"all API tokens,\" so maybe include_revoked is needed. Alternatively, if the second function can retrieve all tokens, but it doesn't take user_id. Hmm. Maybe the user is using the first function, which requires user_id, so that's the one to use."}

The parameters for set_alarm include alarm_time and purpose. The alarm_time needs to be in a standard format.
