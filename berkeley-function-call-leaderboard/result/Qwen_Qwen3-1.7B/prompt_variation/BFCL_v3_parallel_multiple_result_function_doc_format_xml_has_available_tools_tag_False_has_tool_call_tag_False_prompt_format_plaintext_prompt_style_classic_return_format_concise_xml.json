There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant because it takes parameters like museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The other function, get_sculpture_details, requires a sculpture_id, which the user hasn't provided. \n\nThe user didn't mention any specific IDs, so I can't use get_sculpture_details.

For the second, museum is New York, material is bronze, and size [6,3]. \n\nWait, the sculpture_size parameter in get_artwork_price is an array. The user provided dimensions as 4 ft x 4 ft, which is two numbers, so that's fine. The function requires the sculpture_material and museum_location, which are provided. \n\nSo I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each location and sculpture. Then, I can calculate the average of the two prices. But the user wants the average, so after getting both prices, I'll add them and divide by 2.

That should give the total energy.\n\nNext, they need to find the biomass produced using the energy and the conversion efficiency of 10%. The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency. Since efficiency is 10%, which is 0.1 as a float, I'll input that.\n\nThird, the machine needs to move 2 meters. The physical.calc_work function requires energy and distance. From the first step, the total energy is known, so I can use that value and the distance of 2 meters here.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned the machine needs to move 2 meters, so the work done is energy multiplied by distance? But the function physical.calc_work takes energy and distance. So, if the energy is the total energy from the bacteria, then the work would be energy * distance. But the function might handle that calculation. So, I need to call physical.calc_work with the energy from the first step and distance 2.\n\nBut wait, the user's third part is to calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy produced and the distance.

The user has a few tasks here. First, they want to modify the painting's attributes. The original painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant color. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil medium, and red color. So I need to call the modify_painting function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant over 100 years using the Darwin model. The prediction.evolution function is available. The parameters are species, years, and model. The species is \"African elephant\", years is 100, model is \"Darwin\". So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. They want the probability of a royal flush in a 52-card deck, with 4 favorable outcomes, rounded to 3 decimal places. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. Here, total_outcomes is 52*48*47*46 (since each card is unique), but wait, the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Wait, the description says total_outcomes is the total number of possible outcomes. But for a royal flush, the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5). But the user says there are 4 possible outcomes for a royal flush. So the favorable_outcomes is 4. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Wait, the user says \"there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush\". So the total_outcomes would be the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is C(52,5). But the user might not know that. However, the function requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user is asking for the probability of getting a royal flush, which is 4 / C(52,5). But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes. So the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52*48*47*46*45 (since each card is unique), but that's a huge number. Wait, but the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user says there are 4 possible outcomes, so favorable_outcomes is 4. But the total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52 choose 5. However, the user might not know that, but the function requires the parameters. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes, so favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes is 52*51*50*49*48 / 5! (since it's combinations). But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes, so the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (but that's the numerator for the combination, but the function's total_outcomes is the total number of possible outcomes, which is C(52,5) = 2598960. But the user's input is that there are 4 possible outcomes, so maybe the total_outcomes is 52*51*50*49*48 (the number of possible 5-card hands) and favorable_outcomes is 4. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes, so the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (which is 311875200) and favorable_outcomes=4, and round_to=3. But the user says \"rounded to 3 decimal places\", so the function's round_to parameter is 3. So the function call would be calculate_probability with those parameters.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"the result to be rounded to 3 decimal places\". So the function's round_to is 3. So the parameters are total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (which is 311875200), favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes, so favorable_outcomes is 4. The total_outcomes is the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is 52 choose 5, which is 2,598,960. But the user's input is not providing that. However, the function requires total_outcomes as an integer. So the user's input is that there are 4 possible outcomes, so the function's parameters would be total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 (the number of possible 5-card hands) and favorable_outcomes=4. But that's a big number. However, the function's parameters are required, so the user must provide them. So the function call would be calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52*51*50*49*48 and favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nBut maybe the user is simplifying it. For example, the probability is 4 / (52*51*50*49*48 / 5!) which is 4 / 2598960 = 0.000001539... which is approximately 0.0001539%. But the function's parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So the user's input is that there are 4 favorable outcomes, so the function call would have those parameters. So the answer would be the function calls for modify_painting, prediction.evolution, and calculate_probability."}

The user has three main requests here. First, predicting the house price in San Francisco. Second, finding lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. Third, calculating the lottery probability.\n\nStarting with the house price. The user provided area (2000 sq ft), rooms (4), year (1985), and location (San Francisco). The predict_house_price function requires these parameters. So I need to call that function with those values.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The function lawsuit_search needs the entity (Mr. John Doe), county (San Francisco), and state (California, which is default). Since the user specified San Francisco county, I'll include that. The state is optional, but since they mentioned San Francisco, maybe the state is California. But the function's state parameter is optional, so I can leave it out unless needed. Wait, the user says \"county of San Francisco,\" so the county is San Francisco, and the state is California. But the function's state parameter is optional, so maybe it's okay to not include it. But the function's description says the state is optional with default California. So I can call the function with entity=\"Mr. John Doe\", county=\"San Francisco\".\n\nThird, the lottery probability. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes (1000), favorable_outcomes (5), and round_to (3). The user wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places. So parameters are total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make three function calls: predict_house_price, lawsuit_search, and calculate_probability. Each with their respective parameters. Let me check if all parameters are provided. For the house price, all required parameters are there. For lawsuits, entity and county are required, state is optional but provided as California. For lottery, all parameters are given. So yes, all functions can be called."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems right. The parameters are game_name, season, and item_type. So I'll call that with game_name \"Animal Crossing\", season \"Summer\", and item_type \"fish\".\n\nNext, they asked for the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function needs game, platform, and region. So game is \"Fortnite\", platform \"Playstation\", region \"Asia\". That should get the highest score.\n\nThen, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function requires company_name, year, and case_type. The user didn't specify a case type, so I'll use the default 'all'. So company_name \"Apple Inc.\", year 2018, case_type \"all\".\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So those parameters are all there.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly with the right parameters. Let me check each one again. Yes, all parameters are covered. No missing info. So the four function calls should be made in order."}
