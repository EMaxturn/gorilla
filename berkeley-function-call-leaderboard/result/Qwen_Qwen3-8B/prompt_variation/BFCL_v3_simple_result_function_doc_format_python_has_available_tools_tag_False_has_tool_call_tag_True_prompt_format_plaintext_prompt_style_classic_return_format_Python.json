The height here is 150 meters. The initial velocity is given as zero, so I should set that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different value. Since the problem doesn't mention any other gravity, I'll use the default. So the function call should include height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Wait, the initial_velocity is optional with a default of zero, but the user explicitly said initial velocity is zero, so including it makes sense. But maybe the function's default is already zero.

The function takes desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional, default 6). So the desired number here is 6, and they want it to happen twice. Since the die is six-sided, die_sides is 6, which is the default. So I don't need to specify that unless I want to change it, but in this case, it's standard.\n\nSo the probability of rolling a six once is 1/6.

The status has a default of 'ongoing', which matches the user's request. \n\nThe company is clearly 'Google'. The start_date needs to be after January 1, 2021. The format required is MM-DD-YYYY. So January 1, 2021 would be '01-01-2021'. The user said 'after', so maybe the start_date should be '01-01-2021' to include that date. But sometimes APIs use exclusive ranges, but since the function's description says 'date range for when the lawsuit was filed', I'll assume using '01-01-2021' as the start_date will capture all filings from that date onward. \n\nLocation is California, which is the full state name, so that's correct. The status is ongoing, which is the default, so even if not specified, it would be included. But since the user explicitly mentions ongoing, including it makes sense. \n\nWait, the parameters for the function: start_date is a string in MM-DD-YYY format. The example given is '01-01-2021'. The user's query says 'filed after January 1, 2021', so the start_date should be '01-01-2021' to include that date. But if the function's start_date is inclusive, then that's correct. If it's exclusive, maybe we need to use '01-02-2021', but since the user says 'after', perhaps the start_date should be the next day.

All parameters are provided. The function call should include these. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters. The function requires company, start_date, location, and status. All are provided.

The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters: location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences.\n\nThe location should be \"Manhattan, New York\" since they want it near there. Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The preferences mention pet friendly, so I should include that in the preferences list. The function allows preferences as an optional list, so I'll add \"pet friendly\" to that parameter.\n\nWait, the function's parameters have preferences as a list. So I need to pass it as a list. The default is to use all if not specified, but since the user has a specific preference, I should include it. So the parameters would be location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"2023-03-10\", preferences=[\"pet friendly\"].\n\nI should make sure the date format is correct. The start_date example uses \"March 10th, 2023\" but the function might expect a different format. Wait, the function's start_date is a string, but the example in the user's question is \"March 10th, 2023\". However, in programming, dates are often in YYYY-MM-DD format. But the function's documentation doesn't specify, so maybe it's okay to use the user's format. Alternatively, maybe the function expects a specific format. Since the user provided \"March 10th, 2023\", I'll use that as the start_date. But sometimes systems require MM/DD/YYYY. Hmm. The user might have written it as \"March 10th, 2023\", but perhaps the function expects \"2023-03-10\". However, since the function's parameters don't specify, I'll go with the user's input format. Wait, the user's input is \"March 10th, 2023\", but maybe the function expects a different format. But since the function's parameters don't specify, I'll use the exact string provided. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle different formats. To be safe, perhaps convert it to \"2023-03-10\". But the user's instruction says to use the parameters as given. Wait, the user's question says \"starting from March 10th, 2023\", so the start_date should be \"March 10th, 2023\". But maybe the function expects a date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\". However, since the function's documentation doesn't specify, I'll use the user's exact string. Alternatively, maybe the function can parse it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The start_date is a string, so it's up to the function's implementation. Since the user provided \"March 10th, 2023\", I'll use that. \n\nSo putting it all together, the function call would be hotel_booking with location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"March 10th, 2023\", preferences=[\"pet friendly\"]. \n\nWait, the preferences are optional, but the user specified pet friendly, so including that makes sense. The function's parameters have preferences as a list, so it's correct to pass it as a list. \n\nI think that's all. The parameters are all provided, so the function call should be made with these arguments."}
