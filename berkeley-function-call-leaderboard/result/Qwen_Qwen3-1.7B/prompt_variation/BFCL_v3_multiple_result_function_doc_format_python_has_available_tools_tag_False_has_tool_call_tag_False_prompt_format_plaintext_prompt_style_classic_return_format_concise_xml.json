The question mentions straight line motion, so I should use the kinematics formula for displacement when there's constant acceleration.\n\nThe formula for displacement when initial speed, acceleration, and time are known is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. So plugging in the values: u=20, a=10, t=5. Let me check the available functions. There's a function called calculate_displacement which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. That's exactly what I need. The parameters are all provided here. The user didn't mention rounding, so default is 2 decimals.

However, the store_price function might just return the current price, not the cheapest. But maybe the user is asking for the current price, which is the cheapest available at that moment. Alternatively, maybe there's a function that finds the cheapest price, but looking at the provided functions, there's no such function. The available functions are store_currency, which gets the currency, and store_price, which gets the price. So perhaps the user is expecting the current price, which is the cheapest available. But the problem is that the store_price function might not necessarily return the cheapest price, but the current price. However, the user might be assuming that the current price is the cheapest. So maybe the answer is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the cheapest selling price. But the functions provided don't have a function that finds the cheapest price. The store_price function gives the current price. So maybe the user is expecting that the current price is the cheapest. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the cheapest price by checking multiple regions or platforms, but the functions provided don't support that.

The user is asking to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about acceleration, but the user wants the final speed. \n\nWait, the functions provided are kinematics.calculate_acceleration and kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check what each does. \n\nThe calculate_speed_from_rest function takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration. But the parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). \n\nWait, but the user is asking for final speed, which would be calculated using the formula v = u + at, where u is initial speed (0 here), a is acceleration, t is time. But the problem is that the user hasn't given acceleration directly. However, the calculate_speed_from_rest function might use the distance and time to find the speed. \n\nWait, but if the object starts from rest, then the distance can be calculated using the equation s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Since u=0, s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. So a = 2s/t\u00b2. Then, final speed v = a*t = 2s/t. \n\nBut the user wants to find the speed given distance, time, and starting from rest. So the calculate_speed_from_rest function might be designed to take distance, time, and initial speed (which is 0 here) and compute the speed. \n\nSo the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (20 meters), time (4 seconds), initial_speed (0). The function would then compute the speed. \n\nBut the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance as 20 (which is an integer), time as 4 (integer), and initial_speed as 0. So the function can be called with these values. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting to use calculate_acceleration, but that function requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But since the user is given that it started from rest, maybe they need to calculate acceleration first and then use it to find speed. But the calculate_speed_from_rest function seems more directly applicable here. \n\nSo the answer is to call calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

Where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check the parameters.

The parameters are elements and order. The user specified ascending order, which is the default, so maybe I don't need to specify the order parameter. But the function requires the elements list. \n\nSo the elements are ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], and the order is 'asc' by default. So I should call sort_list with elements as the list and order as 'asc' to be explicit. Wait, the default is 'asc', so maybe it's optional. But the function's parameters say order is a str with default 'asc'. So maybe I can just pass the elements. But the user explicitly said ascending, so including the order might be better. However, the function's default is already 'asc', so maybe it's not necessary. But the user's instruction says to sort in ascending, so including the order parameter is safe.\n\nSo the function call would be sort_list with elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order='asc'. But the function's parameters have order as optional. So the correct call is sort_list(elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], order='asc')? Or maybe just elements? Wait, the function's parameters say order is a str, default 'asc'. So the function can be called with just elements. But the user wants to sort in ascending order, which is the default.

The default is 'asc', so even if we don't specify order, it would sort in ascending. But the function requires the elements.

But I need to check if the function allows that. The description says the category can be things like gender, race, age. Veterans might be a category, but maybe not. Wait, the function's parameters are category (str), and the examples given are gender, race, age. So maybe \"veterans\" isn't listed as a valid category.
