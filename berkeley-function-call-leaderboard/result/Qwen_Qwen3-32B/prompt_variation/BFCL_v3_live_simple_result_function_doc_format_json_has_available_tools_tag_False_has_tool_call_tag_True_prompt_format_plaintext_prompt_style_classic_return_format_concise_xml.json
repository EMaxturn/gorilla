The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. \n\nNext, the district_name should be Sankampang, and sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating needs to be 4.5. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't mentioned, so they can be left as default. Also, has_late_check_in defaults to False, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. The function requires the parameters in a certain format. Let me structure the function call with the necessary parameters. Service_id is 2, province_id is 2, district_name is \"Sankampang\", sub_district_name is \"Ton Pao\", and rating is 4.5. The rest can use their default values. That should cover the user's request."}
