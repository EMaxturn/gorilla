For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance. Multiplying them together gives (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. But wait, the user mentioned a six-sided die, so the die_sides parameter would be 6. The function provided is probability.dice_roll, which takes desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional). \n\nThe desired_number here is 6, number_of_rolls is 2.

The required parameters are company, start_date, and location. The status is optional with a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe company is clearly 'Google'. The start_date is after January 1, 2021, so I should format that as MM-DD-YYYY, which would be 01-01-2021. The location is California, which is the full state name. Since the status is 'ongoing', which is the default, I don't need to include it unless the user specifies a different status. The user did mention 'ongoing', so maybe include it explicitly? Wait, the default is already ongoing, so including it is optional. But the user specified it, so maybe better to include it to be safe. Wait, the parameters say status is required=false, default is 'ongoing'. So if the user says 'ongoing', we can include it or not. But since the user explicitly mentioned it, maybe include it. Hmm, but the function's default is ongoing, so even if we omit it, it should still work. However, to match the user's query exactly, perhaps include it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The status parameter's description says the default is 'ongoing'. So if the user wants ongoing, we can leave it out. But since the user specified it, maybe include it. Wait, the user's query says \"ongoing lawsuits\", so including the status parameter with 'ongoing' would make it explicit. But since the default is already ongoing, it's optional. However, to ensure that the function uses the correct status, maybe include it. \n\nSo the parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'. \n\nWait, but the start_date is supposed to be the start of the date range. The user says \"filed after January 1, 2021\". Does \"after\" mean starting from January 2, 2021? Or is the start_date inclusive? The function's description says \"Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021. But sometimes, \"after\" can be ambiguous. However, the user wrote \"after January 1, 2021\", so perhaps the start date is the next day. But maybe the function is designed to include the start date. The user might intend to include January 1, 2021 and onwards. Wait, the user says \"filed after January 1, 2021\", which typically means dates greater than January 1, 2021. So the start_date should be 01-02-2021. But maybe the function's start_date is inclusive. The description isn't clear. Since the user wrote \"after\", perhaps the correct start_date is 01-01-2021, but that's the date itself. Hmm. Maybe the user intended to include January 1, 2021. Alternatively, maybe the function uses start_date as the lower bound, inclusive. Since the user's query is a bit ambiguous, but the way it's phrased is \"after January 1, 2021\", which usually means not including that date. However, in practice, when people say \"after\", sometimes they mean \"on or after\". But given that the function's parameter is called start_date, perhaps it's intended to be the earliest date to include. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after (but not including) January 1, 2021, then start_date should be 01-02-2021. But since the user might not be precise, maybe it's safer to use 01-01-2021 as the start_date. The function's documentation says \"Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\", so perhaps it's inclusive. Therefore, using 01-01-2021 would include that date. But the user said \"after\", which is a bit conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake and meant \"on or after\", so we should use 01-01-2021. Alternatively, if the user truly wants after, then 01-02-2021. But since the user wrote \"after January 1, 2021\", perhaps the correct start date is 01-01-2021. Wait, no. If you file after January 1, that would be from January 2 onwards. So maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021. But the function's parameter is called start_date, which might be the earliest date to include. So perhaps the user's query is a bit ambiguous, but given the function's parameters, we should use 01-01-2021 as the start_date. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include January 1, 2021. Since the user wrote \"after\", perhaps the correct approach is to use 01-01-2021. Hmm. This is a bit of a judgment call. I'll proceed with 01-01-2021 as the start_date, assuming that the user wants lawsuits filed on or after that date. \n\nSo the parameters are company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'. \n\nBut since the status is optional and defaults to 'ongoing', including it is optional. However, the user explicitly mentioned 'ongoing', so including it would be better. \n\nTherefore, the function call should include all four parameters."}

The user is asking about a chord progression in music theory. The function provided is music.theory.chordProgression, which takes a progression array, and two optional boolean parameters: returnAllPossibleKeys and assumeMajor.\n\nThe user's input is progression=['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV']. They didn't specify the other parameters. The function's default for returnAllPossibleKeys is false, and assumeMajor is true by default. \n\nSo, the task is to determine the key signature for this progression. The progression given is I, V, vi, IV. In Roman numerals, uppercase denotes major chords, lowercase minor. The I chord is the tonic. Let's think about common progressions. \n\nIn C major, the I is C major, V is G major, vi is A minor, IV is F major. That matches the progression. The key here would be C major. Since assumeMajor is true by default, the function will check major keys first. The user didn't ask for all possible keys, so the function will return the first valid one, which should be C major. \n\nI need to call the function with the given progression. The parameters not specified will use their defaults. So the function call should include the progression array, and the other parameters are omitted. The user's example uses the same progression, so the function should work as intended."}
