It requires:\n\n   - db_name: string (e.g., \"employees\")\n\n   - table: string (e.g., \"personal_data\")\n\n   - operation: string (e.g., \"delete\")\n\n   - columns: array of strings (e.g., [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"])\n\n   This seems perfect for the task.\n\n2. **database.create_backup**: This is for creating a backup before modification. It's a good practice to back up data before making changes, as mentioned in its description.\n\nThe user didn't explicitly ask for a backup, but the function's description says it's for before modification. I should consider if I need to call this first.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nTo be thorough and safe, I should first create a backup before modifying the database, as it's a standard practice.\n\nSo, my plan:\n\n1. First, call **database.create_backup** to back up the database.\n\n2. Then, call **database.modify_columns** to delete the columns.\n\nFor **database.create_backup**, I need:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\"\n\n- backup_location: The user didn't specify a location. The function requires it, so I have to provide one. The prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But I need to make the function call if possible. I might need to assume a default or indicate it's missing, but the instructions say to only return function calls in the specified format.\n\nThe system prompt: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" And \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" This is tricky. If I can't make the call because of missing parameters, I shouldn't make it.\n\nFor backup_location, it's required, and the user didn't provide it. So, I need to point that out? But the response format is only for TOOLCALL.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" And \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nI need to check if I can proceed. Perhaps I can use a default or something, but I shouldn't assume.\n\nIn the function description, it doesn't specify a default for backup_location, so I must provide it.\n\nThis is a problem. The user's question lacks the backup_location parameter if I decide to call it.\n\nMaybe I can just call the modify function directly, as that's what they asked.\n\nBut to be best, I should include the backup.\n\nPerhaps I can make the backup call with a assumed location, but that might not be accurate.\n\nThe system prompt doesn't allow me to add other text; I have to stick to TOOLCALL format.\n\nIf I can't fulfill it completely, I should only call what I can.\n\nFor database.modify_columns, I have all required parameters from the user's message:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\"\n\n- table: \"personal_data\"\n\n- operation: \"delete\"\n\n- columns: [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"]  (assuming those are the column names)\n\nThe user said \"email addresses and social security numbers\", so likely columns named \"email\" and \"social_security_number\" or similar. I'll assume that's the case.\n\nFor backup, since backup_location is missing, I shouldn't call it.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in the response, I can only use TOOLCALL or not.\n\nPerhaps if I can't call it, I just don't include it and call what I can.\n\nTo complete the task, I should at least call the modify function.\n\nThe best approach is to call database.modify_columns first, as that's the direct request.\n\nThen, if needed, the system can handle further interactions.\n\nThe prompt: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I'll call database.modify_columns.\n\nBefore that, is there a way to call backup? No, because backup_location is required and not provided.\n\nI could call backup with a parameter, but I don't know what to use.\n\nPerhaps I should only call modify_columns.\n\nLet's check the function for backup: it has 'timestamp' with a default, but backup_location is required.\n\nI think I have to skip backup or not call it.\n\nTo be safe, I'll just call the modify function.\n\nSo, my response should be a TOOLCALL with database.modify_columns.\n\nParameters:\n\n- db_name: \"employees\" (string)\n\n- table: \"personal_data\" (string)\n\n- operation: \"delete\" (string)\n\n- columns: [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"] (array of strings)\n\nYes.\n\nThe user said \"email addresses and social security numbers\", so columns might be \"email_address\" or something, but I'll use \"email\" and \"social_security_numbers\" as per common naming.\n\nThe user said \"their email addresses and social security numbers\", so likely columns named like that, but for simplicity, I'll use [\"email\", \"social_security_number\"].\n\nNow, format the TOOLCALL correctly."}

Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nSo, I should start by calling the necessary functions.\n\nFirst, to get rewards for different missions, I might need to know what missions are available. So, perhaps call game_missions.list for Fortnite, then use that to call game_rewards.get.\n\nBut the user didn't explicitly ask to list missions; they asked for rewards with different missions.\n\nTo be thorough, I should list missions first.\n\ngame_rewards.get can be called with specific mission and trophy.\n\nSince the user didn't specify which ones, I need to make a general call.\n\nThe best first step is to call game_rewards.get with the required parameters and perhaps without mission and trophy to get overall rewards.\n\nTo cover \"different missions and trophies\", I might need to make multiple calls, but I don't know what they are.\n\nThis might require assuming or making one call and letting the system handle it.\n\nPerhaps I can make a single call with defaults.\n\nBut that might not fully answer the question.\n\nAnother idea: Call game_missions.list first to get the list of missions, then in subsequent turns, use that to call game_rewards.get.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step 1: Call game_missions.list for the game \"Fortnite\" to get the list of missions.\n\nThen, once I have that, I can call game_rewards.get for each mission and trophy combination.\n\nSince I can only output functions in this response, I should start with game_missions.list.\n\nThe user is asking directly for rewards, not for listing missions.\n\nHowever, to provide accurate information, I need the missions first.\n\nPerhaps game_rewards.get can handle without specifying mission and trophy.\n\nTo fulfill \"different missions and trophies\", I need to query for them.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's check the function descriptions again.\n\ngame_rewards.get: \"Retrieve information about different types of rewards that you can receive when playing a certain game.\" It mentions mission and trophy as optional.\n\nIf I call it with just game and platform, it might return general rewards or rewards for all.\n\nTo be precise, I should make the call with the available information.\n\nPerhaps the simplest is to call game_rewards.get with game and platform, and let it return what it can.\n\nThe user specified \"with different missions and trophies\", so I need to indicate that.\n\nI can't make conditional calls; I have to specify in the function call.\n\nAnother thought: Since mission and trophy are optional, if I don't provide them, it might return rewards for all or default.\n\nIn the function call, I can only make one call per function instance.\n\nI can make multiple function calls in one <TOOLCALL>.\n\nFor example, call game_rewards.get multiple times with different parameters, but I don't know what parameters to use.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nPerhaps the system expects me to make one call first.\n\nI think the best is to first call game_missions.list to get the missions, then proceed.\n\nSo, I'll start with that.\n\nFirst function call: game_missions.list with game = \"Fortnite\".\n\nAfter that, in the next turn, I can use the response to make further calls.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, my response should be: <TOOLCALL> with the function for game_missions.list."}

The material must be one from the enum: ['Bronze', 'Marble', 'Terracotta', 'Wood', 'Stone'].\n\nThe user is asking about material options, which are defined in the function's parameters. So, I need to handle two parts: answering the material options and processing the order.\n\nMy role is to make function calls if possible. The instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" And I should only return function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe question has two parts:\n\n1. Order a custom bronze sculpture of a horse. For this, I can use sculpture.create_custom with item='horse' and material='Bronze'.\n\n2. What material options are available? This isn't directly a function call; it's more of a query about the function's parameters. The functions don't have one to list options; I just know from the description.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nIt also says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nFor the order part, I can make a function call to sculpture.create_custom.\n\nFor the material options, there's no function to query that. I shouldn't add extra text; I should only output function calls.\n\nThe prompt emphasizes: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nSo, I should only respond with <TOOLCALL> if I'm calling a function.\n\nThe user is asking for information (material options) which I can't provide via a function call. According to the instructions, if none of the functions can be used for that part, I should point it out, but I have to do it within the response format.\n\nThe exact instruction: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But it says to point it out in the response, yet the response should only contain <TOOLCALL>.\n\nThis is tricky. The prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nFor the part I can handle, I should call the function.\n\nPerhaps I can just call the function for the order, and ignore the query part, or the system will handle it later.\n\nThe user said: \"I want to order... What material options are available?\"\n\nI can proceed with the order since I have all parameters: item='horse', material='Bronze'.\n\nFor the material options, since there's no function, I might not address it directly.\n\nIn the function description, the materials are listed, so perhaps in a full system, after I call the function, it might respond with details, but I need to focus on what I can do.\n\nThe best action is to call the sculpture.create_custom function with the provided details, as that directly fulfills the order part.\n\nSo, I'll prepare a function call for sculpture.create_custom with item=\"horse\" and material=\"Bronze\". The size is optional, so I don't need it.\n\nThe function call format must be exact.\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"sculpture.create_custom\">\n\n<param name=\"item\" type=\"string\">horse</param>\n\n<param name=\"material\" type=\"string\">Bronze</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nI think that's the way to go.

Its description is: \"Calculate the heat capacity at constant pressure of air using its temperature and volume.\"\n\nThe parameters for 'calc_heat_capacity' are:\n\n- temp: integer, description: The temperature of the gas in Kelvin.\n\n- volume: integer, description: The volume of the gas in m^3.\n\n- gas: string, description: Type of gas, with air as default.\n\nRequired parameters: temp and volume.\n\nThe user provided:\n\n- Temperature: 298K, which is an integer.\n\n- Volume: 10 m^3, which is also an integer.\n\n- Gas: Not specified, but the function says air is the default, so I don't need to provide it unless specified.\n\nSince gas is not required and defaults to air, I can proceed without it.\n\nI need to make a function call in the specified format:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name\">\n\n<param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor this, the function name is 'calc_heat_capacity'.\n\nParameters:\n\n- name=\"temp\" type=\"integer\">298</param>\n\n- name=\"volume\" type=\"integer\">10</param>\n\nI should confirm the types: temp is integer, and 298 is an integer.
