They mentioned straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics function for displacement.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters given are all integers: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. The function's parameters are all integers except for rounding, which is optional.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. It fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, defaults to US). Since the user specified the US, maybe the region parameter isn't needed, but including it would be safe to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe function might return the current price, but the user mentioned \"cheapest,\" which implies they want the lowest possible price. However, the function's description says it fetches the selling price, not necessarily the cheapest. But maybe the function returns the current price, and if there's a sale, it would reflect that. Alternatively, maybe there's another function to check sales. Let me check the other functions.\n\nThe video_games.on_sale function checks if a game is on sale. If the game is on sale, the store_price function might return the discounted price. So perhaps I should first check if it's on sale using on_sale, then get the price. But the user is asking for the cheapest price, which could be the sale price if applicable. However, the functions available don't mention a function to get historical prices or compare prices over time. So the best approach is to use store_price to get the current price, which might be the cheapest if there's a sale. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the store_price function returns the lowest available price, but that's not specified. The user might need to check both the current price and any ongoing sales. But given the functions provided, I can only use store_price and on_sale. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the cheapest selling price. If the game is on sale, the store_price would return the sale price, which is cheaper. So I should first check if it's on sale, then get the price. But the user might not need that step. Alternatively, the store_price function might already return the current price, which could be the sale price. \n\nSince the user is asking for the cheapest, perhaps the store_price function is the right one. Let me proceed with that. The parameters are game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform: PlayStation, region: United States. So the function call would be to video_games.store_price with those parameters."}

The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which calculates speed when starting from rest, using distance, time, and maybe initial_speed.\n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters: it requires distance (integer) and time (integer), which the user provided (20 meters and 4 seconds). The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, which matches the scenario. So I should use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed.
