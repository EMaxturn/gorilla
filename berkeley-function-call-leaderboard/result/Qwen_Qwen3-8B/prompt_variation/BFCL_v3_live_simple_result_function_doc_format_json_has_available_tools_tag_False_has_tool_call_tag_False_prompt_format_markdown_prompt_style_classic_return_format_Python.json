The available function is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time. The parameters are all there: loc is the address provided, type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. I should format the location correctly as per the example given in the function's parameters. The example uses 'Address, City, State' format, so the address should be adjusted to match that. The original address is 123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704. Wait, the street name might need to be in English or adjusted.

However, the function's default is None, but the system instruction says to default to today's date. Hmm, maybe the function's default is set to the current date, but the user might need to specify it. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the note says to calculate the current date in India. So perhaps the function will automatically use today's date if not provided. But to be safe, since the user asked for today, maybe I should include the current date. However, the function's default is None, but the system's note says to default to today's date. Maybe the function is designed to use the current date if not provided. So in this case, since the user is asking for today, I can omit the movie_date parameter, and the function will use today's date.

The user is looking for a housewife who provides ironing services in Chiang Mai, specifically in Sankampang District, Ton Pao Subdistrict. They also want someone with a 4.5-star rating.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function getDataForProfessional can retrieve professionals based on service type, location, and other criteria. The parameters required are service_id and province_id, which are mandatory. \n\nThe service_id for ironing is 2, as per the enum in the function's parameters. The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district_name is Sankampang, and the sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating should be 4.5. \n\nWait, the function's parameters have defaults for district and sub-district, but since the user specified them, I should include those. The start and end available dates aren't mentioned, so I can leave those out. The has_late_check_in is optional and not specified, so default to False. The rating is given as 4.5, which is a float. \n\nSo the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', rating=4.5. That should cover all the user's requirements."}
