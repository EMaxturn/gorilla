From the list, there is a function called \"music.theory.chordProgression\".\n\nIts description: Identifies a potential key signature for the given chord progression.\n\nParameters:\n\n- progression: An array of strings, like ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV']. This is required.\n\n- returnAllPossibleKeys: A boolean, optional, default false.\n\n- assumeMajor: A boolean, optional, default true.\n\nThe user has provided the progression parameter: ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'].\n\nThey haven't specified returnAllPossibleKeys or assumeMajor, so I should use the defaults: returnAllPossibleKeys as false, and assumeMajor as true.\n\nAs an expert in composing functions, I need to make a function call in the specified format. I should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```\n\n[{\n\n\"function\": \"func_name1\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\n\"param2\": \"value2\"\n\n}\n\n}]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor this, I need to call \"music.theory.chordProgression\" with the parameters provided by the user, and use defaults for the others.\n\nThe user said: \"music.theory.chordProgression(progression=['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'])\"\n\nThis is like a direct invocation, but I have to translate it into a proper tool call.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```\n\n[{\n\n\"function\": \"music.theory.chordProgression\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"progression\": [\"I\", \"V\", \"vi\", \"IV\"]\n\n}\n\n}]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nI don't need to include the other parameters since they have defaults and the user didn't specify them.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the required parameter (progression) is provided, so that's fine.\n\nFinally, I should only return this and nothing else."}
