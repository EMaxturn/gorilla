The question is asking for the final speed, which would be the final velocity.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check its parameters. The function requires distance, time, and optionally initial speed. The user provided all three: distance 20, time 4, and since it starts from rest, initial speed is 0. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have distance as an integer, time as an integer, and initial_speed as an integer. The user's data fits here. So I can call this function with distance 20, time 4, and initial_speed 0. \n\nAlternatively, the other function calculate_acceleration requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance.
