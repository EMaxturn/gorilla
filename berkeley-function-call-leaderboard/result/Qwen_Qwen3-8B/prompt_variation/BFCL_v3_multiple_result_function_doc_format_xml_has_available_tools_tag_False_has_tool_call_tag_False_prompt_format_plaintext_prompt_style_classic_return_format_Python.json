The parameters provided by the user are all integers: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. The function's parameters are all integers except for rounding, which is optional.

Just plug them into the displacement function."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. It fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, defaults to US). Since the user specified the US, maybe the region parameter isn't needed, but including it would be safe to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe function might return the current price, but the user mentioned \"cheapest,\" which implies they want the lowest possible price. However, the function's description says it fetches the selling price, not necessarily the cheapest. But maybe the function returns the current price, and if there's a sale, it would reflect that. Alternatively, maybe the store_price function gives the regular price, and the on_sale function checks if it's on sale. But the user is asking for the cheapest, which could involve checking both the regular price and any sale prices. However, the available functions don't have a way to get historical prices or compare multiple sales. \n\nWait, the user might be assuming that the store_price function returns the current price, which could be the cheapest if there's a sale. Since there's no function that directly gives the cheapest price across all time, the best approach is to call store_price with the given parameters. The on_sale function could check if it's on sale, but even if it is, the store_price would return the sale price. So maybe just calling store_price is sufficient. \n\nSo the parameters would be game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'. That should get the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available at the moment. The user didn't mention checking other regions, so focusing on the US as specified."}

The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which calculates speed when starting from rest, using distance, time, and maybe initial_speed.\n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters: it requires distance and time. The user provided both: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, which matches the scenario. So I should use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. There's no need for the other function because this one directly addresses the problem. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info. Alright, that's the right call."}

Since they're the same gas, the molar masses would be the same, but maybe that's not needed here.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2.

Maybe they mean the latest trend, so perhaps the default is sufficient. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The required parameter is room, which is provided.

It requires initial_investment, rate_of_return, years, and optionally contribution. The required parameters are all provided here. The initial investment is $20,000, which is an integer.
