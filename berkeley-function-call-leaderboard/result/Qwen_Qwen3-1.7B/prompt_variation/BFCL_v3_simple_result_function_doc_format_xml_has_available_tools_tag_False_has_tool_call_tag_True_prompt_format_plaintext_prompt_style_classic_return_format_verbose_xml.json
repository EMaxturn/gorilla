Gravity is optional and defaults to 9.81 m/s\u00b2. Since the user didn't specify gravity, I can use the default value. So I need to call the function with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. Wait, but the parameters are required? Let me check the required fields. The height is required, initial_velocity is optional, gravity is optional. So the function can be called with just height and initial_velocity, but since gravity is optional and default is 9.81, it's safe to include it. So the parameters would be height=150, initial_velocity=0, gravity=9.81. But the user didn't mention gravity, so maybe it's better to use the default. However, the function's parameters have gravity as optional. So the call should include all necessary parameters. The user's question specifies initial_velocity as zero, so including that. The height is 150. So the function call should be calculate_final_velocity with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. But wait, the function's parameters have gravity as a float, and the default is 9.81. So if the user doesn't specify, it's okay to omit it. But the function requires the height, which is provided.

No, the required parameters are only height. So the function can be called with just height and initial_velocity. But the user provided initial_velocity as zero, so including that.

So maybe the conditions array should have both elements: one for age and one for job. Like [ { age: 26 }, { job: 'engineer' } ]? Or maybe the function expects the conditions to be in a specific format. The description says conditions are for the query, so perhaps each condition is a separate element in the array. \n\nBut the user's query is \"age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'\". So the conditions are two separate conditions. So the array should have two elements: one for age > 25 and another for job = 'engineer'.
