However, the user specifically asks for the selling price, so store_price is the primary function needed. \n\nWait, the user wants the cheapest price. If the game is on sale, the store_price might already reflect the discounted price. But maybe the on_sale function is separate.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. Wait, the calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed when starting from rest with constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). But wait, the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). But the user provided distance and time, and initial speed is 0. But the function's name is calculate_speed_from_rest, which might be the right one here.\n\nWait, but the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance and time. But how does that relate to acceleration? Because if you have distance, time, and initial speed, you can calculate acceleration first, then find final speed. Alternatively, maybe the function uses the formula that relates distance, time, and acceleration to find the final speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function uses the equation: distance = initial_speed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. Since initial speed is 0, distance = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2. Then acceleration a = 2d / t\u00b2. Once you have acceleration, final speed v = a * t. So combining these, v = (2d/t\u00b2) * t = 2d/t. So for d=20m, t=4s, v=2*20/4=10 m/s. But does the function calculate that directly?\n\nWait, the function calculate_speed_from_rest's parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). But the function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration. So maybe it's using the formula v = sqrt(2ad) if initial speed is zero? Wait, but that would require knowing acceleration. Alternatively, if you have distance and time, maybe it's using the formula d = average speed * time. Since initial speed is zero, average speed is (v + 0)/2 = v/2. So d = (v/2) * t \u2192 v = 2d/t. Which would be 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. So that's the same as before.\n\nSo the function calculate_speed_from_rest might be designed to compute this. Let me check the parameters again. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user's case has initial_speed 0, distance 20, time 4. So the parameters are all provided. Therefore, calling calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0 (though initial_speed is default 0, so maybe it's optional). But the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (int, default 0). So the user's input fits here. Therefore, the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default, so maybe it's not needed. But the function's parameters require distance and time as integers. The user's input has distance 20 (int) and time 4 (int). So that's valid. Therefore, the answer should be to call that function with those parameters."}
