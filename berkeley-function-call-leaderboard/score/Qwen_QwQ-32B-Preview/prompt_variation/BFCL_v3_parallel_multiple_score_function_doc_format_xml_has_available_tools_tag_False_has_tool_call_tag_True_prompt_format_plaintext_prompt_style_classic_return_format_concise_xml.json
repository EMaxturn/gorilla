So, I need to use data from a file called \"dataset.csv\" and fit a linear regression model to predict future sales. Specifically, I'm supposed to set x as the 'sales' data and y as 'future_sales', and also calculate the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to get the data from the CSV file.

So, I need to find out two things for each particle: their weight in amu and their diameter in femtometers.\n\nFirst, let's look at the functions I have available to me. There are three functions from the \"scienceFacts\" category:\n\n1. `getCharge`: This fetches the electric charge of an atomic particle. It requires the particle name and the unit for the charge.\n\n2. `getWeight`: This fetches the atomic weight of an atomic particle. It requires the particle name and the unit for the weight.\n\n3. `getDiameter`: This fetches the diameter of an atomic particle. It requires the particle name and the unit for the diameter.\n\nSo, for the weights, I can use the `getWeight` function, and for the diameters, I can use the `getDiameter` function. The `getCharge` function isn't needed here since the question doesn't ask about electric charges.\n\nThe particles in question are neutrons and protons, and the units specified are amu for weight and femtometers for diameter.\n\nLet me make sure I understand the parameters required for each function:\n\n- For `getWeight`:\n\n  - `particle`: string, required. e.g., \"Neutron\", \"Proton\"\n\n  - `unit`: string, required. e.g., \"amu\"\n\n- For `getDiameter`:\n\n  - `particle`: string, required. e.g., \"Neutron\", \"Proton\"\n\n  - `unit`: string, required. e.g., \"femtometers\"\n\nOkay, so I need to call `getWeight` twice, once for neutron and once for proton, both with unit \"amu\". Similarly, I need to call `getDiameter` twice, once for neutron and once for proton, both with unit \"femtometers\".\n\nLet me plan this out:\n\n1. Call `getWeight` for neutron with unit \"amu\".\n\n2. Call `getWeight` for proton with unit \"amu\".\n\n3. Call `getDiameter` for neutron with unit \"femtometers\".\n\n4. Call `getDiameter` for proton with unit \"femtometers\".\n\nI should make sure that the function calls are formatted correctly. The format required is:\n\n```xml\n\n<function name=\"function_name\">\n\n  <param name=\"param_name\" type=\"param_type\">param_value</param>\n\n  ...\n\n</function>\n\n```\n\nAnd multiple functions should be wrapped in `<functions>` tags within `<TOOLCALL>` tags.\n\nAlso, the types for parameters should be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\nIn this case, both `particle` and `unit` parameters are strings.\n\nSo, for example, to get the weight of a neutron in amu, the function call would look like:\n\n```xml\n\n<function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n\n  <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n\n  <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n\n</function>\n\n```\n\nI need to do this for both neutron and proton for weight, and similarly for diameter.\n\nLet me write all the function calls I need:\n\n1. Get weight of neutron in amu:\n\n```xml\n\n<function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n\n  <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n\n  <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n\n</function>\n\n```\n\n2. Get weight of proton in amu:\n\n```xml\n\n<function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n\n  <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Proton</param>\n\n  <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n\n</function>\n\n```\n\n3. Get diameter of neutron in femtometers:\n\n```xml\n\n<function name=\"scienceFacts.getDiameter\">\n\n  <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n\n  <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">femtometers</param>\n\n</function>\n\n```\n\n4. Get diameter of proton in femtometers:\n\n```xml\n\n<function name=\"scienceFacts.getDiameter\">\n\n  <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Proton</param>\n\n  <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">femtometers</param>\n\n</function>\n\n```\n\nNow, I need to wrap these function calls in `<functions>` tags within `<TOOLCALL>` tags.\n\nSo, the complete `<TOOLCALL>` section would look like this:\n\n```xml\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n  <functions>\n\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n\n    </function>\n\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Proton</param>\n\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n\n    </function>\n\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getDiameter\">\n\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">femtometers</param>\n\n    </function>\n\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getDiameter\">\n\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Proton</param>\n\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">femtometers</param>\n\n    </function>\n\n  </functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n```\n\nI think that covers all the requirements of the question. I'm asking for the weight and diameter of both neutrons and protons in the specified units.\n\nI should also make sure that the function names and parameter names are exactly as specified in the function list. Looking back, the functions are:\n\n- `scienceFacts.getCharge`\n\n- `scienceFacts.getWeight`\n\n- `scienceFacts.getDiameter`\n\nYes, I've used `scienceFacts.getWeight` and `scienceFacts.getDiameter` correctly.\n\nAlso, confirming the parameters:\n\n- `particle`: string, required.\n\n- `unit`: string, required.\n\nI've provided both parameters for each function call.\n\nI don't think I need any other functions for this question. If there were more particles or additional properties required, I might need to call more functions, but for this specific question, these four function calls should suffice.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to proceed with these function calls.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to retrieve the weight and diameter of neutrons and protons using the provided functions. Specifically, we need the weight in atomic mass units (amu) and the diameter in femtometers.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. Use the `scienceFacts.getWeight` function to fetch the weight of neutrons and protons in amu.\n2. Use the `scienceFacts.getDiameter` function to fetch the diameter of neutrons and protons in femtometers.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```xml\n<TOOLCALL>\n  <functions>\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getWeight\">\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Proton</param>\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">amu</param>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getDiameter\">\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Neutron</param>\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">femtometers</param>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"scienceFacts.getDiameter\">\n      <param name=\"particle\" type=\"string\">Proton</param>\n      <param name=\"unit\" type=\"string\">femtometers</param>\n    </function>\n  </functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Weight of Neutron in amu**: We call `scienceFacts.getWeight` with `particle=\"Neutron\"` and `unit=\"amu\"`.\n- **Weight of Proton in amu**: We call `scienceFacts.getWeight` with `particle=\"Proton\"` and `unit=\"amu\"`.\n- **Diameter of Neutron in femtometers**: We call `scienceFacts.getDiameter` with `particle=\"Neutron\"` and `unit=\"femtometers\"`.\n- **Diameter of Proton in femtometers**: We call `scienceFacts.getDiameter` with `particle=\"Proton\"` and `unit=\"femtometers\"`.\n\nEach function call is properly formatted within the `<TOOLCALL>` section, ensuring that all required parameters are included with their respective data types.

Then, I can calculate the average of the two prices.\n\nFirst, for the marble statue in Philadelphia:\n\n- Museum location: Philadelphia\n\n- Sculpture material: marble\n\n- Sculpture size: 4 ft x 4 ft\n\nAnd for the bronze sculpture in New York:\n\n- Museum location: New York\n\n- Sculpture material: bronze\n\n- Sculpture size: 6 ft x 3 ft\n\nI need to make sure that the size is provided in the correct format.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming glucose. I have 5 moles of glucose, and each mole produces 2800 kJ of energy. So, total energy should be the amount of glucose multiplied by the energy per mole.\n\nWait, but there's a function called \"biological.calc_energy\" that can do this for me. Let me check the parameters. It takes \"mols\", \"substance\", and optionally \"joules_per_mol\". Since I'm dealing with glucose, I can provide the chemical formula \"C6H12O6\" and the energy per mole as 2800 kJ/mol. But I need to make sure the units are consistent. The function probably expects energy in joules, not kilojoules. So, 2800 kJ is 2,800,000 joules.\n\nSo, I'll call \"biological.calc_energy\" with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800000.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the biomass produced by the bacteria. I know that the conversion efficiency is 10%, meaning that only 10% of the energy from glucose is converted into biomass. So, biomass can be calculated by multiplying the total energy by the efficiency.\n\nThere's a function called \"biological.calc_biomass\" that takes \"energy\" and optionally \"efficiency\". Since the default efficiency is 10%, I can just provide the total energy, and it should give me the biomass.\n\nFinally, I need to calculate the work done by the machine. I have the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move, which is 2 meters. There's a function called \"physical.calc_work\" that takes \"energy\" and \"distance\" to calculate work.\n\nWait a minute, is work not just equal to force times distance? But here, I have energy and distance. Maybe the function is using energy and distance in some specific way. I should probably just use the energy produced by the bacteria and the distance to calculate work.\n\nSo, I'll call \"physical.calc_work\" with the energy value I get from the previous step and distance=2 meters.\n\nLet me summarize the function calls:\n\n1. Call \"biological.calc_energy\" with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800000 to get the total energy produced.\n\n2. Call \"biological.calc_biomass\" with energy equal to the result from step 1 to get the biomass produced (since efficiency defaults to 10%).\n\n3. Call \"physical.calc_work\" with energy equal to the biomass from step 2 and distance=2 meters to get the work done.\n\nWait, now that I think about it, biomass is not the same as energy. Biomass is likely a measure of mass or some other biological quantity, not energy. Maybe I need to use the total energy produced, not the biomass, to calculate the work done by the machine.\n\nLet me rethink this.\n\nFrom the first step, I calculate the total energy produced from glucose consumption.\n\nThen, only 10% of that energy is converted into biomass, meaning that the biomass represents the energy stored in the bacteria's mass.\n\nBut the machine is being powered by the bacteria, so presumably, the energy available to do work is the energy stored in the biomass.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says: \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol, and the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%\". So, the 10% efficiency means that only 10% of the energy from glucose is converted into biomass. The remaining 90% is wasted, perhaps as heat.\n\nTherefore, the energy available to do work is the energy stored in the biomass, which is 10% of the total energy produced from glucose.\n\nSo, total energy produced from glucose is 5 moles times 2800 kJ/mol, which is 14,000 kJ.\n\nThen, biomass energy is 10% of 14,000 kJ, which is 1,400 kJ.\n\nNow, to calculate the work done by the machine, which moves 2 meters, I need to use this 1,400 kJ of energy.\n\nBut work is typically calculated as force times distance. However, here, I have energy and distance. Maybe the function \"physical.calc_work\" is using the formula work = energy * distance, but that doesn't make physical sense because work has units of energy, which is already in joules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between energy and work.\n\nIn physics, work is a transfer of energy. So, if the machine is using the energy produced by the bacteria to move a certain distance, then the work done by the machine would be equal to the energy expended multiplied by the distance, but that doesn't sound right.\n\nActually, work is equal to force multiplied by distance in the direction of the force. If I know the force, then I can calculate work as work = force * distance.\n\nBut here, I only have energy and distance. Maybe the function is assuming that all the energy is converted into work over that distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's assuming that the energy is used to apply a certain force over that distance.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should just assume that the work done is equal to the energy available, which is 1,400 kJ, and the distance is irrelevant.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense. Perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the work is calculated based on the power output over time, but I don't have time information.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should just use the total energy available to do the work.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the work done is equal to the energy available, which is 1,400 kJ, and the distance is just a parameter that the machine moves over.\n\nBut I need to use the function \"physical.calc_work\", which takes energy and distance as parameters.\n\nPerhaps the function is defined as work = energy * distance, but that doesn't align with physical principles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's work = energy / distance, but again, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there's some confusion here. Maybe I need to clarify what \"work\" means in this context.\n\nIn physics, work is equal to force multiplied by distance. However, energy and work are both measured in joules, so perhaps the function is simply equating work to energy.\n\nBut in that case, why does it take both energy and distance as parameters?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look up the definition of the function \"physical.calc_work\".\n\nWait, but I don't have access to that. I have to work with the information given.\n\nPerhaps the function is calculating the work done against gravity or something, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should proceed with the function as is and assume that it knows how to calculate work from energy and distance appropriately.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Use \"biological.calc_energy\" to find total energy from glucose.\n\n- Use \"biological.calc_biomass\" to find the energy converted into biomass.\n\n- Use \"physical.calc_work\" to find the work done by the machine, using the biomass energy and the distance.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, biomass might not directly represent energy. Maybe it represents mass, and there's a different relationship between mass and energy.\n\nWait, in biology, biomass often refers to the total mass of organisms in a given area. It's typically measured in units of mass, like grams or kilograms.\n\nBut in the function description for \"biological.calc_biomass\", it says \"Calculate the biomass from the energy given the energy conversion efficiency.\" So, it seems like it's calculating mass from energy, using the conversion efficiency.\n\nSo, perhaps biomass is calculated as energy converted into mass, using the efficiency.\n\nBut according to physics, energy and mass are related by E=mc^2, but in biological contexts, this is probably not relevant. Maybe \"biomass\" here is referring to the mass of the bacteria produced from the energy.\n\nIn that case, the function is likely using a simple conversion: mass = energy / energy_per_unit_mass.\n\nBut without knowing the specific implementation, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should proceed with the function calls as planned.\n\nSo, first, calculate the total energy from glucose using \"biological.calc_energy\".\n\nThen, calculate the biomass using \"biological.calc_biomass\", which will give me the mass produced from that energy.\n\nFinally, calculate the work done by the machine using \"physical.calc_work\", using the biomass energy and the distance.\n\nWait, but if biomass is mass, and work requires energy and distance, perhaps I need to convert mass back to energy.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to make some assumptions.\n\nAssumption: The energy available to do work is equal to the energy converted into biomass, which is 10% of the total energy from glucose.\n\nSo, total energy from glucose: 5 moles * 2800 kJ/mol = 14,000 kJ.\n\nBiomass energy: 10% of 14,000 kJ = 1,400 kJ.\n\nNow, work done by the machine: work = energy * distance? That doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps work = energy / distance? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nOr maybe work = energy, and distance is just the distance over which the work is done.\n\nBut in physics, work is force times distance, and energy is the capacity to do work.\n\nI think there's some confusion in the way the problem is set up.\n\nPerhaps the function \"physical.calc_work\" is designed to calculate work based on energy and distance in a specific context, and I need to trust that it's implemented correctly.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the function calls as planned.\n\nSo, first, call \"biological.calc_energy\" with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800000.\n\nThen, call \"biological.calc_biomass\" with the energy from step one.\n\nFinally, call \"physical.calc_work\" with the biomass energy and distance=2 meters.\n\nBut wait, biomass is mass, not energy. Maybe I need to calculate the energy available from the biomass.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should simplify.\n\nAssuming that the energy available to do work is equal to the energy converted into biomass, which is 10% of the total energy from glucose.\n\nSo, total energy from glucose: 5 * 2800000 J = 14,000,000 J.\n\nBiomass energy: 10% of 14,000,000 J = 1,400,000 J.\n\nNow, work done by the machine: presumably, the machine uses this energy to move 2 meters.\n\nBut how is work related to energy and distance? Without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the function \"physical.calc_work\" is defined as work = energy * distance, but that doesn't make physical sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's work = energy / distance, but again, that doesn't align with physics.\n\nMaybe the function is calculating work done against gravity, or some other force, but without knowing the specific implementation, I can't be sure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just proceed with the function as provided.\n\nSo, in summary, my function calls will be:\n\n1. Call \"biological.calc_energy\" with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800000 to get total energy.\n\n2. Call \"biological.calc_biomass\" with energy equal to the result from step 1 to get biomass energy (assuming 10% efficiency).\n\n3. Call \"physical.calc_work\" with energy equal to the biomass energy from step 2 and distance=2 meters to get the work done.\n\nI need to make sure that the units are consistent. Since joules_per_mol is in joules, and distance is in meters, everything should be consistent in SI units.\n\nAlright, let's proceed with these function calls.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy produced by bacteria from consuming glucose, the biomass produced from that energy, and finally, the work done by a machine powered by this bacteria over a specific distance. We will use the provided functions to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria:**\n   - Use the function `biological.calc_energy` with the given parameters:\n     - `mols`: 5 moles of glucose\n     - `substance`: \"C6H12O6\" (glucose)\n     - `joules_per_mol`: 2,800,000 joules per mole (since 2800 kJ/mol)\n\n2. **Calculate the biomass produced by the bacteria:**\n   - Use the function `biological.calc_biomass` with the total energy produced and the default efficiency of 10%.\n\n3. **Calculate the work done by the machine:**\n   - Use the function `physical.calc_work` with the biomass energy and the distance of 2 meters.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```xml\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"biological.calc_energy\">\n    <param name=\"mols\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n    <param name=\"substance\" type=\"string\">C6H12O6</param>\n    <param name=\"joules_per_mol\" type=\"float\">2800000</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"biological.calc_biomass\">\n    <param name=\"energy\" type=\"float\">[result from biological.calc_energy]</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"physical.calc_work\">\n    <param name=\"energy\" type=\"float\">[result from biological.calc_biomass]</param>\n    <param name=\"distance\" type=\"float\">2</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Calculate Total Energy Produced:**\n   - The function `biological.calc_energy` computes the total energy produced from the consumption of glucose.\n   - Parameters:\n     - `mols`: 5 moles of glucose.\n     - `substance`: \"C6H12O6\" indicating glucose.\n     - `joules_per_mol`: 2,800,000 joules per mole (equivalent to 2800 kJ/mol).\n\n2. **Calculate Biomass Produced:**\n   - The function `biological.calc_biomass` calculates the biomass produced from the total energy, assuming a default conversion efficiency of 10%.\n\n3. **Calculate Work Done by the Machine:**\n   - The function `physical.calc_work` computes the work done by the machine using the energy available from the biomass and the distance of 2 meters.\n   - Note: The exact relationship between energy and work in this context is handled by the function, considering the specific implementation of `physical.calc_work`.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the work done by the machine powered by the bacteria.", "possible_answer": [{"biological.calc_energy": {"mols": [5.0], "substance": ["C6H12O6", "glucose"], "joules_per_mol": [2800.0, ""]}}, {"biological.calc_biomass": {"energy": [14000.0], "efficiency": [0.1, ""]}}, {"physical.calc_work": {"energy": [1400.0], "distance": [2.0]}}]}

He's trying to decide between three different investment options, and he wants to know which one will give him the best returns after their respective investment periods. To help him out, I need to calculate the returns for each option using the functions provided: calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value.\n\nFirst up, let's understand each investment option and match them with the appropriate function.\n\n**Option 1:** Simple interest scheme with a principal of $5000, invested for 5 years at an annual interest rate of 4%.\n\nFor simple interest, I should use the calc_Simple_Interest function. Looking at its parameters:\n\n- principle_amount: float, required\n\n- duration: float, required\n\n- annual_rate: float, required\n\nSo, I need to plug in:\n\n- principle_amount = 5000\n\n- duration = 5\n\n- annual_rate = 4\n\n**Option 2:** Compound interest scheme with a principal of $5000, invested for 5 years at an annual interest rate of 3.5%, compounded annually.\n\nFor compound interest, I should use the calc_Compound_Interest function. Its parameters are:\n\n- principle_amount: float, required\n\n- duration: float, required\n\n- annual_rate: float, required\n\n- compound_freq: integer, optional (defaults to 1, which is annually)\n\nSince it's compounded annually, I can either specify compound_freq = 1 or leave it out, as it defaults to 1.\n\nSo, I'll use:\n\n- principle_amount = 5000\n\n- duration = 5\n\n- annual_rate = 3.5\n\n- compound_freq = 1 (though optional)\n\n**Option 3:** Invest $3000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years, with interest compounded twice a year.\n\nThis seems like another compound interest scenario, but it specifies using the future_value function. Let's check the parameters for future_value:\n\n- initial_investment: float, required\n\n- interest_rate: float, required (as a decimal)\n\n- time: integer, required\n\n- num_compoundings: integer, optional\n\nWait a minute, the interest_rate here needs to be in decimal form, not percentage. So, 5% would be 0.05.\n\nAlso, num_compoundings is optional, and since it's compounded twice a year, I should set num_compoundings = 2.\n\nSo, for future_value:\n\n- initial_investment = 3000\n\n- interest_rate = 0.05\n\n- time = 6\n\n- num_compoundings = 2\n\nBut hold on, the principal for this option is $3000, not $5000 like the first two options. Is that correct? Yes, according to the problem statement.\n\nNow, I need to make sure I'm using the right functions for each option.\n\nOption 1: calc_Simple_Interest with the parameters mentioned.\n\nOption 2: calc_Compound_Interest with the parameters mentioned.\n\nOption 3: future_value with the parameters mentioned.\n\nI should also note that for simple interest, the formula is:\n\nSimple Interest = principle_amount * duration * annual_rate / 100\n\nFor compound interest, the formula is:\n\nCompound Amount = principle_amount * (1 + annual_rate / (100 * compound_freq)) ^ (compound_freq * duration)\n\nAnd for future_value, the formula is:\n\nFuture Value = initial_investment * (1 + interest_rate / num_compoundings) ^ (num_compoundings * time)\n\nBut since I have functions to do these calculations, I don't need to implement the formulas myself.\n\nI need to call these functions and get the results for each option.\n\nOnce I have the results, I can compare them to see which investment option gives the highest return.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that all amounts are comparable, meaning I should look at the total amount after the investment period, including both the principal and the interest earned.\n\nWait, for simple interest, the calc_Simple_Interest function probably returns only the interest earned, not the total amount. Similarly, for compound interest, it might return only the interest earned or the total amount. I need to clarify that.\n\nLooking back at the function names:\n\n- calc_Simple_Interest: likely returns only the interest earned.\n\n- calc_Compound_Interest: might return only the interest earned or the total amount.\n\n- future_value: probably returns the total amount, including principal and interest.\n\nTo make sure, I need to check the function descriptions.\n\nLooking at the function list:\n\n<function name=\"calc_Simple_Interest\">\n\n<desc>Compute simple interest.</desc>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"calc_Compound_Interest\">\n\n<desc>Compute compound interest.</desc>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"future_value\">\n\n<desc>Calculates the future value of an investment given an interest rate and time period.</desc>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\nFrom the descriptions:\n\n- calc_Simple_Interest: computes simple interest, which is typically just the interest earned, not including the principal.\n\n- calc_Compound_Interest: computes compound interest, which could be interpreted as either the interest earned or the total amount, but I need to confirm.\n\n- future_value: calculates the future value of an investment, which includes both the principal and the interest.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should assume:\n\n- calc_Simple_Interest returns only the interest earned.\n\n- calc_Compound_Interest returns only the interest earned.\n\n- future_value returns the total amount, including principal and interest.\n\nIf that's the case, then for options 1 and 2, I need to add the principal to the interest earned to get the total amount after the investment period. For option 3, the future_value already includes the principal.\n\nSo, for option 1:\n\nTotal amount = principal + calc_Simple_Interest(principal, duration, rate)\n\nFor option 2:\n\nTotal amount = principal + calc_Compound_Interest(principal, duration, rate, compound_freq)\n\nFor option 3:\n\nTotal amount = future_value(initial_investment, interest_rate, time, num_compoundings)\n\nI need to ensure that I'm comparing the total amounts correctly.\n\nNow, let's proceed to make the function calls.\n\nFirst, for option 1:\n\n<function name=\"calc_Simple_Interest\">\n\n<param name=\"principle_amount\" type=\"float\">5000</param>\n\n<param name=\"duration\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n\n<param name=\"annual_rate\" type=\"float\">4</param>\n\n</function>\n\nThen, add the principal to get the total amount.\n\nSecond, for option 2:\n\n<function name=\"calc_Compound_Interest\">\n\n<param name=\"principle_amount\" type=\"float\">5000</param>\n\n<param name=\"duration\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n\n<param name=\"annual_rate\" type=\"float\">3.5</param>\n\n<param name=\"compound_freq\" type=\"integer\">1</param>\n\n</function>\n\nAgain, add the principal to get the total amount.\n\nThird, for option 3:\n\n<function name=\"future_value\">\n\n<param name=\"initial_investment\" type=\"float\">3000</param>\n\n<param name=\"interest_rate\" type=\"float\">0.05</param>\n\n<param name=\"time\" type=\"integer\">6</param>\n\n<param name=\"num_compoundings\" type=\"integer\">2</param>\n\n</function>\n\nThis should return the total amount directly.\n\nAfter getting these values, I can compare them to advise John on which option is the most beneficial.\n\nBut wait, there's a discrepancy here. Option 3 has a different principal amount ($3000) compared to the first two options ($5000). Is that correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"third option where he can invest an initial amount of $3000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year.\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So, for option 3, the principal is $3000, not $5000.\n\nDoes John have an additional $3000 to invest, or is this meant to be an alternative to the $5000?\n\nThe problem says \"He has $5000 that he wants to invest for a period of 5 years.\" but then mentions a third option with $3000 invested for 6 years.\n\nThis seems like a separate investment, perhaps with different terms.\n\nAssuming John can invest either $5000 in options 1 or 2, or $3000 in option 3, I need to calculate the returns for each and compare them.\n\nHowever, since the principals are different, the comparison might not be directly apples to apples.\n\nPerhaps John is considering investing the $5000 in option 3 by contributing more than $3000, but the problem specifies $3000 for option 3.\n\nI need to proceed with the given amounts.\n\nSo, for options 1 and 2, principal is $5000, and for option 3, it's $3000.\n\nAfter calculating the total amounts for each, John can decide based on which one gives the highest return, considering the investment amounts and time periods.\n\nI should also note the different time periods: options 1 and 2 are for 5 years, and option 3 is for 6 years.\n\nTo make a fair comparison, John might want to look at the returns relative to the investment amount and time period, perhaps by calculating the annualized return.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with calculating the total amounts as requested.\n\nLet's make the function calls accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the returns for three different investment options using the provided functions: `calc_Simple_Interest`, `calc_Compound_Interest`, and `future_value`. Each option has different parameters, so we will call the appropriate function with the correct arguments for each scenario.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Option 1:** Simple interest investment of $5000 for 5 years at an annual interest rate of 4%.\n   - Use `calc_Simple_Interest` function.\n   - Calculate total amount by adding the principal to the simple interest.\n\n2. **Option 2:** Compound interest investment of $5000 for 5 years at an annual interest rate of 3.5%, compounded annually.\n   - Use `calc_Compound_Interest` function.\n   - Calculate total amount by adding the principal to the compound interest.\n\n3. **Option 3:** Investment of $3000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years, with interest compounded semi-annually.\n   - Use `future_value` function.\n   - This function directly provides the future value including the principal and compounded interest.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```xml\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n    <!-- Function call for Option 1: Simple Interest -->\n    <function name=\"calc_Simple_Interest\">\n        <param name=\"principle_amount\" type=\"float\">5000</param>\n        <param name=\"duration\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n        <param name=\"annual_rate\" type=\"float\">4</param>\n    </function>\n    \n    <!-- Function call for Option 2: Compound Interest -->\n    <function name=\"calc_Compound_Interest\">\n        <param name=\"principle_amount\" type=\"float\">5000</param>\n        <param name=\"duration\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n        <param name=\"annual_rate\" type=\"float\">3.5</param>\n        <param name=\"compound_freq\" type=\"integer\">1</param>\n    </function>\n    \n    <!-- Function call for Option 3: Future Value with compound interest -->\n    <function name=\"future_value\">\n        <param name=\"initial_investment\" type=\"float\">3000</param>\n        <param name=\"interest_rate\" type=\"float\">0.05</param>\n        <param name=\"time\" type=\"integer\">6</param>\n        <param name=\"num_compoundings\" type=\"integer\">2</param>\n    </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Option 1:** We use `calc_Simple_Interest` with the principal amount of $5000, duration of 5 years, and an annual interest rate of 4%. The result will be the interest earned, so we need to add the principal to get the total amount.\n\n2. **Option 2:** We use `calc_Compound_Interest` with the principal amount of $5000, duration of 5 years, annual interest rate of 3.5%, and compounded annually (compound frequency of 1). The result will be the interest earned, so we add the principal to get the total amount.\n\n3. **Option 3:** We use `future_value` with an initial investment of $3000, annual interest rate of 5% (as a decimal, 0.05), time period of 6 years, and interest compounded semi-annually (num_compoundings=2). This function directly provides the future value including the principal and compounded interest.\n\nAfter obtaining the results from these function calls, John can compare the total amounts from each option to decide the best investment strategy based on his financial goals and constraints.", "model_result_decoded": [{"calc_Simple_Interest": {"principle_amount": 5000.0, "duration": 5.0, "annual_rate": 4.0}}, {"calc_Compound_Interest": {"principle_amount": 5000.0, "duration": 5.0, "annual_rate": 3.5, "compound_freq": 1}}, {"future_value": {"initial_investment": 3000.0, "interest_rate": 0.05, "time": 6, "num_compoundings": 2}}], "possible_answer": [{"calc_Simple_Interest": {"principle_amount": [5000.0], "duration": [5.0], "annual_rate": [0.04]}}, {"calc_Compound_Interest": {"principle_amount": [5000.0], "duration": [5.0], "annual_rate": [0.035], "compound_freq": [1, ""]}}, {"future_value": {"initial_investment": [3000.0], "interest_rate": [0.05], "time": [6], "num_compoundings": [2]}}]}

I'll set the country to \"Italy\", century to 19, and aspect to \"art\".\n\nSo, I'll make these function calls accordingly.\n\n**Function Calls:**\n\n- To get the monarchs of France during the 17th century:\n\n  - Function: `european_history.get_monarchs`\n\n  - Parameters:\n\n    - country: \"France\"\n\n    - century: 17\n\n- To get major wars that took place in England during the 18th century:\n\n  - Function: `european_history.get_events`\n\n  - Parameters:\n\n    - country: \"England\"\n\n    - century: 18\n\n    - event_type: \"war\"\n\n- To get prominent art movements in Italy during the 19th century:\n\n  - Function: `european_history.get_culture`\n\n  - Parameters:\n\n    - country: \"Italy\"\n\n    - century: 19\n\n    - aspect: \"art\"", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"european_history.get_monarchs": {"country": ["France"], "century": [17]}}, {"european_history.get_events": {"country": ["England"], "century": [18], "event_type": ["war", ""]}}, {"european_history.get_culture": {"country": ["Italy"], "century": [19], "aspect": ["art", ""]}}]}

First, for breakfast, you're looking for a recipe that uses eggs, milk, and bread, and it should be under 300 calories. I think the 'recipe_search' function can help with that. I'll need to provide it with the ingredients and the calorie limit. Also, since it's breakfast, I should specify that in the meal parameter.\n\nSo, for the breakfast recipe, I'll call the 'recipe_search' function with ingredients set to ['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories set to 300, and meal set to 'breakfast'.\n\nNext, for lunch, you want to find a restaurant that serves dishes with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, and the dishes should be under 500 calories. The 'restaurant_search' function seems perfect for this. I'll need to pass the ingredients ['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories set to 500, and maybe specify that it's for lunch.\n\nLastly, for dinner, you have a recipe that uses beef, but you want to replace the beef with tofu and ensure the total calories are under 600. The 'ingredient_replace' function should handle the substitution, but I need to make sure that after replacing beef with tofu, the recipe's calories don't exceed 600.\n\nWait a minute, the 'ingredient_replace' function replaces an ingredient in a recipe, but I don't have a specific recipe yet. Maybe I need to first find a dinner recipe that uses beef and is under 600 calories, and then replace the beef with tofu, ensuring the calories still stay under 600.\n\nSo, perhaps I should first use the 'recipe_search' function for dinner, specifying ingredients including beef, and calories under 600, and meal type as dinner. Then, take that recipe and use 'ingredient_replace' to swap beef with tofu, again ensuring the calories don't exceed 600.\n\nBut I'm not sure if 'ingredient_replace' can handle the calorie check after replacement. Maybe I need to verify the calories after replacement separately.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Maybe 'ingredient_replace' already considers the calorie limit after replacement. Let me check the function description again.\n\nThe 'ingredient_replace' function description says: \"Replaces an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute, keeping the calories below a certain number.\" So, it seems like it does take into account the calorie limit after the replacement.\n\nIn that case, for dinner, I might need to first find a recipe that uses beef and is under 600 calories, and then use 'ingredient_replace' to substitute beef with tofu, ensuring the calories still don't exceed 600.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to search for recipes that use tofu instead of beef, but I'm not sure. Let me see.\n\nWait, the 'recipe_search' function allows specifying ingredients, so maybe I can directly search for dinner recipes that use tofu, and are under 600 calories.\n\nBut the initial plan was to have a beef recipe and replace beef with tofu. Maybe that's unnecessary, and I can just search for tofu recipes directly.\n\nBut perhaps you have a specific beef recipe in mind that you want to modify.\n\nActually, in your message, you said, \"I have a recipe for dinner that uses beef, but I want to replace the beef with tofu and keep the total calories under 600.\"\n\nSo, it seems like you already have a recipe that uses beef, and you want to replace the beef with tofu while ensuring the calories don't exceed 600.\n\nIn that case, I can use the 'ingredient_replace' function, providing the original ingredient as 'beef', the replacement ingredient as 'tofu', and the calorie limit as 600.\n\nBut wait, does 'ingredient_replace' require the recipe ID or something to know which recipe to modify? Looking back at the function description, it doesn't seem to require a recipe ID. Maybe it searches for recipes that contain the original ingredient and then replaces it with the substitute, filtering by the calorie limit.\n\nI think I need to clarify how 'ingredient_replace' works. Does it return a list of recipes where the ingredient has been replaced, or does it modify an existing recipe?\n\nUpon reviewing the function description, it seems like 'ingredient_replace' is designed to replace an ingredient in a recipe with a substitute, ensuring the total calories remain below the specified limit.\n\nGiven that, for dinner, I can directly call 'ingredient_replace' with original_ingredient='beef', replacement_ingredient='tofu', and calories=600.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I don't have a specific recipe to start with. Maybe 'ingredient_replace' is meant to be used on a specific recipe, but based on the description, it seems it can handle the replacement generally.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that 'ingredient_replace' can handle the replacement across multiple recipes that contain the original ingredient, and it will return recipes where the ingredient has been substituted and the calorie count is within the limit.\n\nIn that case, for dinner, I can call 'ingredient_replace' with the specified parameters.\n\nSo, to summarize, here are the function calls I need to make:\n\n1. For breakfast:\n\n- Call 'recipe_search' with ingredients=['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories=300, meal='breakfast'\n\n2. For lunch:\n\n- Call 'restaurant_search' with ingredients=['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories=500, meal='lunch'\n\n3. For dinner:\n\n- Call 'ingredient_replace' with original_ingredient='beef', replacement_ingredient='tofu', calories=600\n\nI think that covers all your requests. Once I have the results from these function calls, I can provide you with the breakfast recipe, suggest a restaurant for lunch, and offer a modified dinner recipe with tofu instead of beef, all within your specified calorie limits.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo address the user's meal planning needs, we will utilize the available functions to search for recipes and restaurants, and to replace ingredients in recipes while adhering to specific caloric constraints. The approach involves three main steps: searching for a breakfast recipe, finding a suitable restaurant for lunch, and replacing an ingredient in a dinner recipe.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Breakfast Recipe Search:**\n   - Use the `recipe_search` function to find a recipe that includes eggs, milk, and bread, with a maximum of 300 calories, specified for breakfast.\n\n2. **Lunch Restaurant Search:**\n   - Use the `restaurant_search` function to find restaurants that serve dishes containing chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, with a maximum of 500 calories, specified for lunch.\n\n3. **Dinner Recipe Ingredient Replacement:**\n   - Use the `ingredient_replace` function to replace beef with tofu in dinner recipes, ensuring the total calories do not exceed 600.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```xml\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"recipe_search\">\n    <param name=\"ingredients\" type=\"array\">eggs,milk,bread</param>\n    <param name=\"calories\" type=\"integer\">300</param>\n    <param name=\"meal\" type=\"string\">breakfast</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"restaurant_search\">\n    <param name=\"ingredients\" type=\"array\">chicken,tomatoes,lettuce</param>\n    <param name=\"calories\" type=\"integer\">500</param>\n    <param name=\"meal\" type=\"string\">lunch</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"ingredient_replace\">\n    <param name=\"original_ingredient\" type=\"string\">beef</param>\n    <param name=\"replacement_ingredient\" type=\"string\">tofu</param>\n    <param name=\"calories\" type=\"integer\">600</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Breakfast Recipe Search:**\n   - The `recipe_search` function is called with the ingredients set to ['eggs', 'milk', 'bread'], calories set to 300, and meal type set to 'breakfast'. This will return recipes that match these criteria.\n\n2. **Lunch Restaurant Search:**\n   - The `restaurant_search` function is invoked with ingredients ['chicken', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce'], calories set to 500, and meal type set to 'lunch'. This will provide a list of restaurants offering dishes that include these ingredients and meet the calorie requirement.\n\n3. **Dinner Recipe Ingredient Replacement:**\n   - The `ingredient_replace` function is used to replace 'beef' with 'tofu' in dinner recipes, ensuring the total calories do not exceed 600. This function will handle the substitution and calorie verification.\n\nBy executing these function calls, we can effectively plan the user's meals for the day, accommodating their preferences and caloric constraints.", "possible_answer": [{"recipe_search": {"ingredients": [["eggs", "milk", "bread"]], "calories": [300], "meal": ["breakfast"]}}, {"restaurant_search": {"ingredients": [["chicken", "tomatoes", "lettuce"]], "calories": [500], "meal": ["lunch"]}}, {"ingredient_replace": {"original_ingredient": ["beef"], "replacement_ingredient": ["tofu"], "calories": [600]}}]}

Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the function of the molecule ATP in the mitochondria, and I should get a specific function if possible. Looking at the functions available, there's one called \"cell_biology.function_lookup\" which seems perfect for this job. It takes three parameters: molecule, organelle, and specific_function. So, I'll call this function with molecule set to \"ATP\", organelle set to \"mitochondria\", and specific_function set to true.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. There's a function for that called \"get_shortest_driving_distance\". It requires an origin and a destination, and optionally a unit. Since I need the distance in miles, I'll specify the unit as \"miles\", although I'm not sure if it defaults to kilometers or something else.\n\nThen, I need to find out who is credited for the discovery of the theory of relativity. There's a function called \"get_scientist_for_discovery\" that takes a discovery as a parameter. So, I'll use that with \"theory of relativity\" as the discovery.\n\nLastly, I need to find the current retail price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. There's a function for that too, \"instrument_price.get\", which requires the brand, model, and finish. Assuming \"Fender Stratocaster\" is the model, I'll set brand to \"Fender\", model to \"Stratocaster\", and finish to \"sunburst\".\n\nLet me make sure I have all the parameters correct for each function:\n\n1. cell_biology.function_lookup:\n\n- molecule: ATP\n\n- organelle: mitochondria\n\n- specific_function: true\n\n2. get_shortest_driving_distance:\n\n- origin: New York\n\n- destination: Los Angeles\n\n- unit: miles\n\n3. get_scientist_for_discovery:\n\n- discovery: theory of relativity\n\n4. instrument_price.get:\n\n- brand: Fender\n\n- model: Stratocaster\n\n- finish: sunburst\n\nAlright, I think that covers all the tasks.

I need to modify the painting's attributes: change the size to 30x40 inches, switch the medium from acrylic to oil, and change the dominant color to red. I look at the available functions, and there's one called \"modify_painting\" which seems perfect for this job.\n\nLooking at the parameters for \"modify_painting\", it requires the new size, medium, and optionally the dominant color. The default dominant color is blue, but I need to change it to red, so I'll make sure to specify that.\n\nSo, for the function call, it should look like this:\n\n<function name=\"modify_painting\">\n\n<param name=\"size\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">30x40 inches</param>\n\n<param name=\"medium\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">oil</param>\n\n<param name=\"dominant_color\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">red</param>\n\n</function>\n\nWait, but in the function description, the size is supposed to be in inches, width by height, and it's a string. So \"30x40 inches\" should be fine. Medium is a string, so \"oil\" is straightforward. Dominant color is optional, but I'm setting it to \"red\".\n\nAlright, once this function is called, the painting should be updated with the new attributes.\n\nNext, I need to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant species for the next 100 years using the Darwin model. There's a function for that called \"prediction.evolution\". Let's see what parameters it needs.\n\nIt requires the species name, the number of years for the prediction, and optionally, the model to use. The default model is Darwin, which is what I need, so I don't have to specify the model unless I want to use Lamarck or something else.\n\nSo, the function call should be:\n\n<function name=\"prediction.evolution\">\n\n<param name=\"species\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">African elephant</param>\n\n<param name=\"years\" type=\"integer\" required=\"true\">100</param>\n\n</function>\n\nThat should give me the predicted evolutionary rate for the African elephant over the next 100 years using the Darwin model.\n\nFinally, I need to calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in a game of poker. There are 52 cards in a deck, and there are 4 possible royal flush combinations. I need to calculate the probability and round it to 3 decimal places.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's \"calculate_probability\" which requires the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes, and optionally, the number of decimal places to round to.\n\nSo, in this case, total_outcomes is 52 choose 5, which is the number of possible 5-card hands from a 52-card deck. I need to calculate that first. Let's see, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is 52 and k is 5.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to calculate it manually because the function probably expects me to provide the total number of possible outcomes directly. So, C(52, 5) is 2,598,960. And there are 4 favorable outcomes (one for each suit).\n\nSo, the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"calculate_probability\">\n\n<param name=\"total_outcomes\" type=\"integer\" required=\"true\">2598960</param>\n\n<param name=\"favorable_outcomes\" type=\"integer\" required=\"true\">4</param>\n\n<param name=\"round_to\" type=\"integer\" required=\"false\">3</param>\n\n</function>\n\nThis should give me the probability rounded to three decimal places.\n\nAlright, summarizing:\n\n1. Modify the painting's attributes using \"modify_painting\" with size \"30x40 inches\", medium \"oil\", and dominant_color \"red\".\n\n2. Predict the evolutionary rate for the African elephant over 100 years using \"prediction.evolution\" with species \"African elephant\" and years 100.\n\n3. Calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in poker using \"calculate_probability\" with total_outcomes 2598960, favorable_outcomes 4, and round_to 3.\n\nOnce these function calls are executed, I should have the new painting attributes, the predicted evolutionary rate, and the probability of getting a royal flush.\n\n**Final Output**\n\nTo achieve the tasks outlined, the following function calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Modify the painting's attributes:**\n\n   - Function: `modify_painting`\n\n   - Parameters:\n\n     - size: \"30x40 inches\" (string)\n\n     - medium: \"oil\" (string)\n\n     - dominant_color: \"red\" (string)\n\n2. **Predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant species:**\n\n   - Function: `prediction.evolution`\n\n   - Parameters:\n\n     - species: \"African elephant\" (string)\n\n     - years: 100 (integer)\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in poker:**\n\n   - Function: `calculate_probability`\n\n   - Parameters:\n\n     - total_outcomes: 2598960 (integer)\n\n     - favorable_outcomes: 4 (integer)\n\n     - round_to: 3 (integer)\n\n**Function Calls in XML Format:**\n\n```xml\n<TOOLCALL>\n  <functions>\n    <function name=\"modify_painting\">\n      <param name=\"size\" type=\"string\">30x40 inches</param>\n      <param name=\"medium\" type=\"string\">oil</param>\n      <param name=\"dominant_color\" type=\"string\">red</param>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"prediction.evolution\">\n      <param name=\"species\" type=\"string\">African elephant</param>\n      <param name=\"years\" type=\"integer\">100</param>\n    </function>\n    <function name=\"calculate_probability\">\n      <param name=\"total_outcomes\" type=\"integer\">2598960</param>\n      <param name=\"favorable_outcomes\" type=\"integer\">4</param>\n      <param name=\"round_to\" type=\"integer\">3</param>\n    </function>\n  </functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **modify_painting:** This function updates the painting's dimensions, medium, and dominant color.\n\n- **prediction.evolution:** This function predicts the evolutionary rate of a specified species over a given period using a chosen model.\n\n- **calculate_probability:** This function calculates the probability of an event based on the total and favorable outcomes, optionally rounding the result to a specified number of decimal places.", "model_result_decoded": [{"modify_painting": {"size": "30x40 inches", "medium": "oil", "dominant_color": "red"}}, {"prediction.evolution": {"species": "African elephant", "years": 100}}, {"calculate_probability": {"total_outcomes": 2598960, "favorable_outcomes": 4, "round_to": 3}}], "possible_answer": [{"modify_painting": {"size": ["30x40 inches", "30x40"], "medium": ["oil"], "dominant_color": ["red"]}}, {"prediction.evolution": {"species": ["African elephant"], "years": [100], "model": ["Darwin", ""]}}, {"calculate_probability": {"total_outcomes": [52], "favorable_outcomes": [4], "round_to": [3]}}]}
