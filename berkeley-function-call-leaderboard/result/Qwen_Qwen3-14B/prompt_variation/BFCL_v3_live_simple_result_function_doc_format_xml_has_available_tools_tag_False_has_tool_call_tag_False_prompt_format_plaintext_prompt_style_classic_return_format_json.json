The user wants to retrieve Ethernet interface statistics from a specific node in a pod of the Network1 fabric. The IP given is 192.120.45.67.

The base URL from the function's example is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67 gives the base URL. But the user mentioned node ID 12 in pod 10. I need to check if the parameters should include pod and node ID. The function's parameters are a dict, so maybe the query parameters should be something like podId=10 and nodeId=12. Also, the fabric name is Network1, but I'm not sure if that's part of the URL or parameters. The example URL doesn't include fabric, so maybe it's part of the URL path. Wait, the example URL is for interfaceInfo, which might be the endpoint. So the URL would be https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo. Then the parameters would include podId=10, nodeId=12. But the user asked for Ethernet interface stats. Maybe there's a parameter for interface type, like interfaceType=Ethernet. However, the original function's parameters aren't specified beyond being a dict. The user's question includes all necessary parameters: IP, pod, node ID. So the function call would use the URL with the IP and parameters including podId, nodeId, and maybe interfaceType. But since the function's parameters are a dict, I can include those as key-value pairs. So the final parameters would be {\"podId\": \"10\", \"nodeId\": \"12\", \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}. Wait, but the user didn't mention interfaceType, but they want Ethernet stats. Maybe the endpoint requires that. Alternatively, maybe the endpoint is for interfaceInfo, which includes Ethernet. Hmm, but the user's question is about Ethernet, so maybe the parameter should specify that. However, the original function's parameters aren't detailed, so I have to assume that the parameters needed are podId, nodeId, and possibly others. Since the user provided pod 10, node 12, and the IP, I'll include those in the params. The URL is constructed with the IP, and the params include podId and nodeId. I think that's the correct approach here."}

The base URL should be something like https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo, replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67. Then, the parameters given are fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType. These should be included in the params dictionary. Let me check if all parameters are required. The function's params are required, but the user provided all the necessary ones. So, I'll format the URL with the IP and the parameters into the query string. Wait, the function's params parameter is a dict, so I should pass the parameters as a dictionary. Let me make sure the keys match what the API expects. The parameters provided by the user are Parameter_fabricName, Parameter_nodeId, etc. But the API might expect just fabricName, nodeId, etc. Maybe the Parameter_ prefix is part of the user's input but should be removed. However, the user might have included those prefixes as part of the parameter names. Wait, looking back, the user listed \"Parameter_fabricName: Network1\" which might mean the actual parameter name is fabricName, and the value is Network1. So I should use the parameter names without the \"Parameter_\" prefix. So the params dict would be {\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": \"12\", \"podId\": \"10\", \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}. \n\nThen, the URL is constructed with the IP address. The example given in the function's URL parameter is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', so replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67.

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function which takes directed_by, genre, and cast as parameters. The user specified the director as James Gray, so I should set directed_by to \"James Gray\". They didn't mention genre or cast, so I'll use \"dontcare\" for those parameters to ensure they don't filter out any results. That should retrieve a list of movies directed by James Gray without restricting by genre or cast."}

Shuffle and volume aren't mentioned, so I'll omit them. Just need to call the function with the correct query."}
