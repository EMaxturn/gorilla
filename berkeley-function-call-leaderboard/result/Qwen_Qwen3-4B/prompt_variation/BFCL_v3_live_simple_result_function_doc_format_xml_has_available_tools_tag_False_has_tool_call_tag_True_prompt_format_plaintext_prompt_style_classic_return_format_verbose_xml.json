First, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time.\n\nThe location given is in Vietnamese, but the example format in the function description uses English. However, the function's param description for loc says it's a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The user's address is \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\". I should probably use that as is, even if it's in Vietnamese, since the function doesn't specify that the address needs to be in English. But maybe the system can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the address is in Vietnamese, but the city and state are correct. Wait, Berkeley, CA is in the US, so the address might be a mix. But the function just requires the string, so I'll input it as provided.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which matches the parameter. The time is 10 minutes.

The user wants to retrieve Ethernet interface statistics from a specific node in a pod of a network fabric. The node ID is 12, pod is 10, and the IP address is 192.120.45.67.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available function is requests.get. The description says it's for sending a GET request to a network telemetry API. The parameters required are url and params, both mandatory.\n\nThe URL should be the endpoint without query parameters. The example given is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So substituting the IP here, the URL would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nNow, the params dictionary. The user mentioned node ID 12 in pod 10. The function's params description says they are query parameters. So I need to include parameters like 'pod' and 'node_id' with their respective values. Maybe the query parameters are something like pod=10&node_id=12. But I need to check if the function expects specific parameter names. Since the function's params are a dict, I can structure it as {'pod': '10', 'node_id': '12'}.\n\nWait, the user specified \"Ethernet interface statistics\". Does the API require a specific parameter for the interface type? The original function's example doesn't mention that. The function's params are general, so maybe the query parameters are just pod and node_id. But the user is asking for Ethernet interfaces. Maybe the API endpoint is designed to handle that via the URL path or another parameter. However, based on the given function's parameters, the only required ones are url and params. The example URL doesn't include interface type, so perhaps the params need to include 'interface_type' as 'Ethernet'? But the original function's params description doesn't specify what parameters are needed. The user's question might require that. However, the function's params are a dict, so maybe the user needs to include that. But the problem is, the function's parameters are not detailed beyond the example. The user's question might require including 'interface_type' as 'Ethernet' in the params. But since the function's params are a dict, I can include that.\n\nWait, the original function's params are a dict, but the example given in the function's description doesn't include any parameters. The user's question is about retrieving Ethernet interface stats, so maybe the params should include 'interface_type' set to 'Ethernet', along with pod and node_id. But the function's parameters are not specified beyond the example. The user's question might require that. However, the function's parameters are not detailed, so maybe the user is expected to include those parameters. But since the function's params are a dict, I can include them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the URL is constructed with the IP, and the params are {'pod': '10', 'node_id': '12', 'interface_type': 'Ethernet'}. But I need to check if the function's params are expecting those. Since the function's params are a dict, and the user's question requires retrieving Ethernet stats, it's necessary to include that parameter. However, the original function's example doesn't mention it, but the user's question does. Therefore, the correct approach is to include the necessary parameters in the params dict.\n\nSo the final function call would be requests.get with the URL as 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo' and params as {'pod': '10', 'node_id': '12', 'interface_type': 'Ethernet'}.\n\nBut wait, the function's params are a dict, and the user's question might not have specified the interface_type. However, the user is asking for Ethernet interface statistics, so that parameter is necessary. Therefore, the function call should include that."}

The user is looking for a housekeeper who provides ironing services in Bangkok's Chatuchak District with a 4.5 stars or higher rating. The available function is get_service_id, which retrieves a service's ID based on type, province, district, and rating.\n\nFirst, I need to map the user's request to the function's parameters. The service type here is ironing, which from the function's description corresponds to service_id 2. The province is Bangkok, which has a province_id of 1. The district is Chatuchak, and the rating is 4.5. \n\nWait, the function's parameters include service_id (required), province_id (optional), district_name (optional), and rating (optional). The user's query specifies the service type as ironing, so service_id should be 2. The province is Bangkok, which is province_id 1. The district is Chatuchak, so district_name is \"Chatuchak\". The rating is 4.5, which is a float. \n\nBut wait, the function's get_service_id is supposed to retrieve the service's unique ID based on these parameters. However, the user is asking to find a housekeeper, not necessarily the service ID. But given the available functions, maybe the get_service_id is the only way to get the necessary info. So, the function call would use service_id=2 (ironing), province_id=1 (Bangkok), district_name=\"Chatuchak\", and rating=4.5. \n\nBut the function's description says that the service_id is the unique identifier for the service. Wait, the function's parameters have service_id as a required parameter, but the description says that the function retrieves the unique identifier for a service based on service type and location. So maybe the function is used to find the service ID given the type and location. But the user is asking for a housekeeper, which might be a service provider. However, the available function is get_service_id, which might be the only tool here. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to call get_service_id with service_id=2 (ironing), province_id=1 (Bangkok), district_name=\"Chatuchak\", and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the service ID for ironing in that area with the required rating. Then, perhaps that service ID can be used to find the housekeeper. But since the user's question is to find a housekeeper, maybe the function is the first step. The function's parameters are all provided here. So the tool call should be made with those parameters."}

The function given is get_service_providers. Let me look at its parameters. The service_id is required, and it's an integer. Ironing service is mentioned as service_id 2.

The district_name and sub_district_name are optional, but the user didn't specify those, so maybe they can be left out. But wait, the user mentioned Chonburi Province, which is a province, so maybe the district_name is not needed here. But the function has province_id as optional, so maybe that's sufficient.\n\nThe rating is 4.5, which is a float. So rating=4.5. The availability dates: the user specified 12/03/2024 16:00 to 18:00.
