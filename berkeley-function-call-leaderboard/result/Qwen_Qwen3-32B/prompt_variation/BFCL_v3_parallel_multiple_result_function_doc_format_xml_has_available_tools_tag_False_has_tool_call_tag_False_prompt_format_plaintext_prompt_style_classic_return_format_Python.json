The function data_loading is for that. The required parameter is file_path, which is \"dataset.csv\". The delimiter is optional, but since it's not specified, maybe the default is comma, so I can omit it.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. But the linear_regression_fit function expects x and y as arrays. Assuming that the data_loading function returns a data structure (like a dictionary or DataFrame), I can access those columns. However, the user hasn't provided a function to handle data structures, so I have to assume that after loading, the data is accessible as x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'].\n\nSo the steps are: first call data_loading with file_path=\"dataset.csv\", then use the returned data to get x and y arrays, then call linear_regression_fit with x, y, and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the function calls, I can't chain them directly. The user's system might handle the data loading first. So the first function call is data_loading. Then, once that's done, use the output to get x and y for the regression.

The x and y are arrays from the data, so after loading, they should be extracted. But since the functions are separate, the user's system must handle passing those arrays correctly.

But the functions don't have an average function, so I need to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture separately and then calculate the average. \n\nBut the problem is, the get_artwork_price function might not exist for average; it retrieves the price based on the given parameters. So I need to call the function twice, once for each sculpture, get their prices, and then compute the average. \n\nSo first, call get_artwork_price for Philadelphia, marble, [4,4]. Then call get_artwork_price for New York, bronze, [6,3].

Maybe the function can handle calculating the average if given multiple entries? No, the function's description says \"retrieves the price of a sculpture based on size and material.\" So it's per sculpture.
