The user wants an Uber Plus ride from 123 University Drive, Berkeley, CA 94704 and doesn't want to wait more than 10 minutes. The function provided is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time parameters.\n\nFirst, check the location format. The example given is '123 Main St, Springfield, IL', so the user's address should be formatted similarly. The user provided '123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704'. Wait, '\u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc' is Vietnamese for University Road. But the address should be in English, right? Maybe the user inputted it in Vietnamese, but the function expects an English address. However, the function's description doesn't specify language, just the format. Maybe it's okay as long as the format is correct. But maybe the system expects English. Hmm, but the user might have entered it that way. Should I correct it? The function's parameter example uses English, so maybe the loc should be in English. But the user's input is in Vietnamese. Wait, the user's message is in Vietnamese, but the address might be a mix. Let me check again. The user wrote \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\". So the street name is in Vietnamese, but the city and state are in English. Maybe that's acceptable, but perhaps the function expects the entire address in English. However, the function's parameter description doesn't specify that. It just says the format is 'Address, City, State'. So maybe it's okay. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, but I should use the given address as is.\n\nNext, the type is 'Plus', which matches the parameter. The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So all parameters are present. Therefore, the function call should be uber.ride with loc as \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\", type as \"Plus\", and time as 10. Even though the street name is in Vietnamese, the function might still process it. Unless there's a requirement for English, but the function's example uses English, but the user's input is in Vietnamese. However, the user's instruction is in Vietnamese, but the address might be a local one. Maybe the system can handle it. So proceed with the given parameters."}
