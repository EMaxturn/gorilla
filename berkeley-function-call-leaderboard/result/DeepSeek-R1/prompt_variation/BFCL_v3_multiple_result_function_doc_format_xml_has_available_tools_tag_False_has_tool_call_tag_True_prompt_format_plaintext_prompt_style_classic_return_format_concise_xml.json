It's possible that the game might be available in different editions or bundles on the store, but the function `video_games.store_price` as described does not specify an edition. \n Since the function does not have a parameter for edition, we must assume it returns the price for the standard edition or the base game.\n\n Alternatively, if the store lists multiple versions (like standard, deluxe, etc.), the function might return the lowest price among the base game and its editions? \n However, the description of the function does not specify. Since we are only allowed to use the provided functions, and the question asks for the cheapest, we have to rely on what the function returns.\n\n Since the question does not specify an edition, we will use the function to get the price for the base game.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We call `video_games.store_price` with:\n    - game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n    - platform: 'PlayStation'\n    - region: 'United States'\n\n However, note that the function `video_games.store_price` might return the price for the base game. But if there are multiple listings (like a sale on a bundle or a different edition) we cannot capture that with this function.\n\n But wait: the function `video_games.on_sale` checks if a particular game is on sale. However, we are not asked about sale status but the current selling price.\n\n Since we don't have a function that returns multiple editions, we will assume that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price of the base game. \n\n But note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. If the base game is the only version, then that is the cheapest. However, if there are multiple editions and the base game is not the cheapest, then we would need a different function to get all prices? But we don't have that.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use the `video_games.store_price` function and hope that it returns the cheapest available version of the game? Or maybe the base game? \n\n However, the function description says: \"Fetches the selling price of a specified game\". It does not specify which edition. Since the problem does not specify an edition, we can only get the base game.\n\n Alternatively, if the function `video_games.store_price` returns the lowest price among all editions of the game, then that would be the cheapest. But we don't know.\n\n Since we have no other function to get multiple prices, we must use `video_games.store_price` and assume that it returns the price of the base game or the only available version.\n\n Therefore, we make the call.\n\n Also note: the region is optional and defaults to United States. So we can omit it? But to be explicit, we set it.\n\n Let's call:\n   video_games.store_price with:\n        game_title: \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\"\n        platform: \"PlayStation\"\n        region: \"United States\"\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price. We are not comparing with other platforms? The question is about PlayStation Store.\n\n So we only need one call.\n\n However, the function returns the price. We are not told what the currency is? But the question is about the United States, so it should be in USD.\n\n But to be safe, we can also get the currency for the region? We have a function `video_games.store_currency` that returns the currency for a platform and region.\n\n But the question only asks for the price. It doesn't specify the currency. Since the region is United States, the price will be in USD. However, if we want to be explicit, we could also get the currency? But the question does not ask for the currency.\n\n However, note: the user might want the currency to be clear? But the question says \"cheapest selling price\" and in the context of the United States, it's understood as USD.\n\n But to be safe, we can also fetch the currency? But the question doesn't ask for it. So we will just get the price.\n\n Alternatively, if the function `video_games.store_price` returns an object that includes both amount and currency, then we don't need to call the currency function. However, the function description doesn't specify the return structure. Since we are only making the call, we assume it returns the price in the local currency.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the return type, we just get the price.\n\n Therefore, we will call:\n   video_games.store_price for the game.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` might return the current selling price, which if the game is on sale, would be the sale price. So it should reflect the cheapest current price.\n\n However, if the game is on sale, that sale price might be cheaper than the base price. And our call to `store_price` should return that sale price? Because it returns the selling price.\n\n So we are covered.\n\n Therefore, we make one function call.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.on_sale` is available. We are not required to use it, but we could check if the game is on sale? But the question doesn't ask for sale status, only the price.\n\n So we stick to `video_games.store_price`.\n\n Conclusion: one function call.\n\n Format:\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n  <param name=\"game_title\" type=\"string\">Assassins Creed Valhalla</param>\n  <param name=\"platform\" type=\"string\">PlayStation</param>\n  <param name=\"region\" type=\"string\">United States</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

We are not told how many. The problem says \"the top rated\", so we want one? But note: the function doesn't have a parameter to limit the number.

But without knowing the exact values, we stick to the example which uses \"sculpture\".\n\n   We can also set `user_ratings` to a value that indicates top rated. Since the default is 'high', and we want top, we can set it to 'very high'? But the function doesn't specify. Alternatively, we can set it to 'top'? However, to be safe, we can set it to the highest possible by using a string that implies that. Let's set it to 'top' and hope the function understands.\n\n   Alternatively, if we are not sure, we can leave it out and the default 'high' will be used, and then we get the most popular which are highly rated. Then we can assume the first result is the top? But the problem says \"top rated\", so we want the one with the highest rating? But the function returns multiple? And we don't have a way to sort? So we rely on the function to return the most popular (which might be sorted by rating?).\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we will set:\n      location: \"New York, NY\"\n      art_form: \"sculpture\"\n      user_ratings: \"top\"\n\n   But note: the parameter name is \"user_ratings\", not \"user_ratings\". Wait, in the function description, it's spelled \"user_ratings\". But in the XML, it's spelled correctly: \"user_ratings\". So we use \"user_ratings\".\n\n   Also, note: the function has an optional `month` but we omit it because we want the upcoming month (default).\n\n However, the task says \"modern sculpture\". We are not capturing \"modern\". How can we capture that? We don't have a parameter for style. We might have to hope that the exhibition of sculpture in New York in the upcoming month that is top rated is modern? Or maybe we need to use another function? But we don't have a function to filter by style. Alternatively, we can use the `get_sculpture_info` function? But that function is for a specific artist's sculpture, not for exhibitions.\n\n So we have to make a trade-off: we call `find_exhibition` with the parameters we have and then if we get an exhibition, we might need to check if it is modern? But we don't have a function for that. So we just return the top rated one and hope it's modern? Or note: the task says \"modern sculpture exhibition\", so we are relying on the exhibition being about modern sculpture? We have to assume that the function `find_exhibition` will return exhibitions that are of the specified art_form and we are using \"sculpture\", but modern is a style. Without a style parameter, we cannot specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can set art_form to \"modern sculpture\" and see? But the function doesn't specify if that is allowed. We have to try.\n\n Considering the above, I will set art_form to \"sculpture\" and then in the user_ratings we set to \"top\", and hope that the top rated exhibition in sculpture in New York is modern? Or maybe the system will interpret \"sculpture\" and return any? But the task says \"modern\", so we are missing that.\n\n Another idea: maybe the function `find_exhibition` returns a list of exhibitions and each exhibition might have a description that includes the style? But we are only allowed to call functions and we are not allowed to do post-processing? We are only to output the function call.\n\n Since we don't have a way to specify \"modern\" in the function, we have to call it without and then in the next step, if we get multiple, we might have to filter? But we are only allowed to output function calls and then the system will run them and return the results? Then we can make another function call? But note: we are only at the first turn.\n\n So for now, we call `find_exhibition` with the parameters we have, and then in the next turn, we might process the results? But the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". So we can output multiple function calls in the same turn? The example format allows multiple <function> tags inside <functions>. But in this case, we don't have a function to filter by modern. So we do:\n\n   Step 1: Call `find_exhibition` to get the exhibitions.\n\n   Then, from the result, we might get a list of exhibitions. We would then need to check each exhibition to see if it is modern? But we don't have a function for that. Alternatively, we can call `get_sculpture_info` for the artist of the exhibition? But that function is for a specific artist, and the exhibition might feature multiple artists? And we don't know the artist.\n\n So we are stuck? We have to rely on the `find_exhibition` function to return exhibitions that are of the art_form \"sculpture\" and then we hope that the top one is modern? Or maybe the system has a way to interpret \"modern\" as part of the art_form? Let's try setting art_form to \"modern sculpture\".\n\n Since the function doesn't specify the allowed values, we can try:\n\n   art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n If the function doesn't accept it, it might return an error? But we are not told. We have to do our best.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function with art_form as \"sculpture\" and then in the user_ratings we set to 'top', and then in the next step we can check the description? But we don't have a function to check the style of the exhibition.\n\n Given the constraints, I will set art_form to \"sculpture\" and then hope that the top rated one is modern? Or note: the problem says \"modern sculpture\", so maybe we are expected to use the term \"modern\" in the art_form? Let's try:\n\n   art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n But note: the function `find_exhibition` might not have such a category. Without knowing, we try.\n\n Alternatively, we can leave it as \"sculpture\" and then set user_ratings to a high value and then the first result might be modern? We cannot be sure.\n\n After reconsideration: the function description says \"the form of art the exhibition is displaying\". So if the exhibition is about modern sculpture, then the form is still sculpture. We cannot specify the style. So we have to return the top rated sculpture exhibition and hope it is modern? Or the problem might be satisfied with any sculpture exhibition that is top rated? The problem says \"modern\", so it is a requirement.\n\n We are stuck because the function doesn't have a style parameter. So we have to point it out? The instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But note: we are only allowed to output the function call in the <TOOLCALL> section? And if we cannot call any function, we should point it out? But the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But we are only allowed to return the function call? How do we point it out? The instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" So if we cannot call any function, we should not output a <TOOLCALL>? But then how do we point it out?\n\n Alternatively, we can try to call the function without the modern part? And then note that we are not meeting the requirement? But the problem says \"modern\".\n\n Another idea: maybe we can use the `get_sculpture_info` function? But that function is for a specific artist and it retrieves the most recent artwork by that artist. It doesn't help with exhibitions.\n\n So after analysis, we decide that the function `find_exhibition` is the closest, but we cannot specify the style. We have to call it without the modern part? Or we can set art_form to \"modern sculpture\" and hope that the system understands.\n\n I will set art_form to \"modern sculpture\" and hope.\n\n Therefore, the function call:\n\n   function: find_exhibition\n   parameters:\n      location: \"New York, NY\"\n      art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n      user_ratings: \"top\"\n\n We omit the month because we want the upcoming month (default).\n\n But note: the function expects the location as a string in the format \"New York, NY\". We are using that.\n\n Let's write the function call in the required XML format.\n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` has an optional `user_ratings` and we are setting it to \"top\". But the function doesn't specify the allowed values. We are taking a chance.\n\n Alternatively, if we are not allowed to set it to \"top\", we might set it to \"high\" (the default) and then we get highly rated ones, but not necessarily the top. But the problem says \"top rated\". So we set it to \"top\".\n\n If the function doesn't support \"top\", it might return an error? But we are not told. We do our best.\n\n So the function call is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n  <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n  <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">modern sculpture</param>\n  <param name=\"user_ratings\" type=\"string\">top</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function parameter `user_ratings` is optional. We are setting it. Alternatively, we could leave it out and the default is 'high'. But we want top rated, so we set it to 'top'. \n\n However, the function might not have a value 'top'. We are taking a risk. Alternatively, we can set it to \"very high\" or \"highest\"? We don't know. Let's stick to \"top\".\n\n But note: the function description says \"user rating threshold\", so it might be expecting a threshold. Without knowing, we set to \"top\".\n\n Alternatively, we can leave it out and then the default 'high' will be used. But then we are not getting the top rated, just highly rated.\n\n Since the problem says \"top rated\", we try to set it to the highest possible.\n\n We'll go with \"top\".\n\n If the system does not accept it, then we might have to try again in the next turn? But we are only to output one set of function calls per turn.\n\n So we output the above.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"upcoming month\", and we are omitting the month so it returns upcoming events (which includes the upcoming month?).\n\n We are confident.\n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` returns a list of exhibitions? How do we get the top one? The function doesn't have a parameter for the number of results. So we assume that the function returns the top one? Or the top rated one? The function description says: \"Locate the most popular exhibitions\", so it might return multiple? But the problem says \"the top rated\", implying one. So we assume the function returns the most popular (which is the top) one? Or a list? We are not told. We have to assume that the function returns the top one? Or we get a list and then we take the first? But we are only allowed to call the function and not process the result? The next turn will have the result and then we can decide.\n\n For now, we call the function with the above parameters."}
