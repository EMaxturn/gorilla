The parameters needed are location, movie, and time. Wait, the movies and times are lists? So maybe each movie and corresponding time?\n\nWait, the user is asking for two different movies at different times. So I need to check if the function can handle multiple movies and times. The function's parameters are location (string), movie (list), and time (list). So maybe the movies and times are lists where each index corresponds to each other. Like movie[0] and time[0] are the first movie and its time, and movie[1] and time[1] are the second. \n\nSo the user wants two theaters that have both showtimes. Wait, but the function might return theaters that show each movie at the specified time. But the user wants the same theater to show both movies at those times? Or two different theaters, each with one of the movies at their respective times?\n\nThe question says \"two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\" So maybe each theater has one of the movies at the specified time. So the user wants two theaters: one showing Tenet at 5pm and another showing No Time To Die at 7:30pm. Or maybe the same theater shows both movies at those times. But the way the question is phrased, it's possible they want two separate theaters each with one of the movies at the specified times.\n\nBut the function's parameters are movie as a list and time as a list. So perhaps the function can handle multiple movies and their corresponding times. So if I pass movie=[\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"] and time=[\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"], the function would look for theaters that show Tenet at 5pm and No Time To Die at 7:30pm. But does the function support checking for multiple movies and times in one call? The description says \"specific movie\", but the parameters allow lists. Maybe the function is designed to handle multiple movies and times, checking for each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants two theaters, each with one of the movies at their respective times. So perhaps two separate calls to the function? But the user wants two theaters, so maybe the function can return multiple theaters. But the function's purpose is to find local theaters and their schedule for a specific movie. So perhaps each call is for one movie and time. \n\nWait, the user is asking for two different movies at different times. So maybe I need to make two separate function calls: one for Tenet at 5pm and another for No Time To Die at 7:30pm. Then, the results from each call would give theaters showing each movie at the respective time. Then, the user can pick one theater from each result. But the user wants two theaters, each with one of the movies. \n\nBut the function's parameters have movie as a list and time as a list. So maybe the function can handle multiple movies and times in a single call. For example, if the user wants to find theaters that show both movies at their respective times, perhaps the function can return theaters that have both showtimes. But the function's description says \"specific movie\", which is singular. Hmm, maybe the function is intended to handle one movie and one time per call. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to make two separate function calls. First, find theaters showing Tenet at 5pm, then find theaters showing No Time To Die at 7:30pm. Then, the user can select one theater from each list. However, the user wants two theaters, each with one of the movies. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can take multiple movies and times, and return theaters that have all the specified showtimes. But that's not clear. The function's description says \"specific movie\", which is singular, but the parameters are lists. Maybe it's a mistake, and the function actually handles one movie and one time. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the user's request requires two separate function calls. So first, call find_movie_showing with location=San Diego, movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"]. Then, call it again with movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"]. Then, the results would give two different theaters. \n\nBut the user wants two theaters, each with one of the movies. So the answer would be two function calls. However, the user might want both movies at the same theater, but that's not specified. \n\nGiven the function's parameters, I think the correct approach is to make two separate function calls, each with one movie and one time. Therefore, the tool calls would be:\n\nfind_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"])\nfind_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"])\n\nBut the user might want both movies in the same call. However, the function's description says \"specific movie\", which is singular. So perhaps the function is intended for one movie and one time. Therefore, two separate calls are needed."}

The user wants classical concerts in Berlin and Paris next Friday with parking. The function concert.find_nearby takes location, date, genre, and amenities. The user specified two locations, so I need to call the function for each city. The date is next Friday. Let me check the date format. The function expects a string for date. Assuming the user means the upcoming Friday, I should format it as \"YYYY-MM-DD\". But since the exact date isn't provided, maybe the function can handle relative dates. Alternatively, the user might expect the system to figure out the correct date. The genre is classical, and amenities include parking. The default is already parking, but the user explicitly mentions it, so including it in the call makes sense.\n\nWait, the function's amenities parameter has a default of ['Parking'], so if the user specifies parking, maybe we can include it. But since the user is specific, perhaps it's better to include it explicitly. Also, the user wants concerts in both Berlin and Paris. Since the function's location parameter is a single string, I need to make separate calls for each city. So two function calls: one for Berlin and one for Paris, both with genre=classical, date=next Friday, and amenities=['Parking'].\n\nBut how to handle the date? The user says \"next Friday\". The function expects a date string. The assistant needs to determine the correct date. Let's assume that the current date is known, and next Friday is calculated. For example, if today is Monday, October 9, 2023, then next Friday is October 13. But since the actual current date isn't provided, the function might handle relative dates. However, the user might need to input the exact date. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the function can accept \"next Friday\" as a valid input. Wait, the function's date parameter is a string, but the example in the docstring might expect an actual date. Hmm, this is a problem. The user hasn't given a specific date, just \"next Friday\". The function requires a date string. So perhaps the assistant needs to calculate the date of next Friday. But since the current date isn't provided, maybe the function is designed to handle relative dates. Alternatively, the assistant might need to ask the user for the exact date, but the user hasn't provided it. Wait, the user's question is to find concerts happening next Friday, so the assistant must figure out the correct date. However, without knowing the current date, this is impossible. But in a real-world scenario, the system would have access to the current date. Since this is a hypothetical scenario, perhaps the assistant can proceed by using \"next Friday\" as the date string, assuming the function can interpret it. Alternatively, the function might require an actual date. This is a bit ambiguous. The user might have intended the date to be the upcoming Friday, so I'll proceed with that. So the date parameter would be \"next Friday\". But the function's example might expect a specific date. Hmm. Well, given the information provided, the best approach is to use \"next Friday\" as the date string. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nconcert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])\nconcert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])\n\nBut wait, the amenities default to ['Parking'], so including it explicitly might not be necessary. However, the user specifically mentions parking, so including it ensures clarity. Even though the default includes parking, specifying it again won't hurt. Alternatively, maybe the default is already sufficient. But the user's requirement is to include only those with available parking, so perhaps the default is correct. However, the function's default is ['Parking'], which might mean that it's included by default. Therefore, the user's request is satisfied by the default. But the user says \"I am interested only in those with available parking\", so maybe the function's default is correct. Therefore, the amenities parameter can be omitted. But to be safe, since the user explicitly mentions parking, including it in the call is better. \n\nSo the final function calls are two separate calls for Berlin and Paris with the specified parameters."}

From the given function description, it says that hypot calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of squares. For two dimensions, it's sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), and there's an optional z parameter for three dimensions.\n\nSo for the first two points, (3,4) and (6,8), I can use the hypot function with x and y parameters. The third point (9,12,15) has three coordinates, so I need to include the z parameter as well.\n\nWait, the function's parameters are x, y, and z (optional, default 0). So for the first two points, I just pass x and y. For the third, I pass x, y, and z. Let me check the parameters again. The function's args are x (int), y (int), z (int, optional, default 0). So for (3,4), it's hypot(x=3, y=4). For (6,8), same but x=6, y=8. For (9,12,15), it's x=9, y=12, z=15. Wait, but the order is x, y, z. So the third point's coordinates are (x, y, z) as (9,12,15). So that's correct.\n\nSo I need to make three separate function calls. The user wants each of these calculated using math.hypot.

Then do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, the first part is HCF(45,60). Let me calculate that. The HCF of 45 and 60. Let's see, factors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45. Factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. The common ones are 1, 3, 5, 15. The highest is 15. So the first HCF is 15.\n\nThen, use that result (15) to find HCF with 90 and 120. Wait, HCF of 15, 90, and 120? Or is it HCF of 15 and 90, then that result with 120? The wording says \"find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe it's HCF of 15 and 90, then that result with 120. Wait, but the pair is (90, 120). So maybe it's HCF(15, 90) first, then HCF of that result with 120? Or is it HCF(15, 90, 120)? Hmm. The user's instruction is a bit ambiguous. But the function provided is math.hcf which takes two numbers. So perhaps the user wants to first compute HCF of 15 and 90, then take that result and compute HCF with 120. So two steps: first HCF(15,90) which is 15, then HCF(15,120) which is 15. Alternatively, if it's HCF of all three numbers, but the function can only take two at a time. So maybe the user wants to chain them. So first step is HCF(45,60)=15, then HCF(15,90)=15, then HCF(15,120)=15. But the user's wording says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe it's HCF(15, 90) and HCF(15, 120) separately? Or perhaps HCF(90,120) and then combine with 15? Not sure. But given the function can only take two numbers, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nSimilarly for the second part: HCF(36,48) is 12, then HCF(12,72)=12, then HCF(12,96)=12. But the user's instruction says \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96)\". So maybe HCF(12,72) and HCF(12,96) separately? Or HCF(72,96) first, then with 12? Again, the function can only take two at a time, so need to break it down.\n\nBut the user's question is to first compute HCF(45,60), then use that result to find HCF with (90,120). So perhaps first compute HCF(15,90) and then HCF of that result with 120. So two function calls: first HCF(15,90), then HCF(result, 120). Similarly for the other part: HCF(36,48)=12, then HCF(12,72), then HCF(result,96).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFirst part:\n1. HCF(45,60) = 15\n2. HCF(15,90) = 15\n3. HCF(15,120) = 15\n\nSecond part:\n4. HCF(36,48) = 12\n5. HCF(12,72) = 12\n6. HCF(12,96) = 12\n\nSo the user wants all these steps done. Therefore, the function calls needed are:\n\nmath.hcf(number1=45, number2=60)\nmath.hcf(number1=15, number2=90)\nmath.hcf(number1=15, number2=120)\nmath.hcf(number1=36, number2=48)\nmath.hcf(number1=12, number2=72)\nmath.hcf(number1=12, number2=96)\n\nBut since each function call is separate, I need to list them in order. However, the user's question is to first do the first part and then the second part. So the correct sequence of function calls would be the six as above. However, the user might expect that after the first HCF(45,60), the next step is to take that result and compute HCF with 90 and 120. But since the function can only take two numbers, each step is a separate call. So the first three function calls are for the first part, then the next three for the second part.\n\nSo the answer should include all six function calls in order."}

The function provided is calculate_return_on_investment, which takes purchase_price, sale_price, and dividend (with a default of 0).\n\nFirst, I need to process each stock individually. For the first stock: purchase_price is $150, sale_price $180, dividend $20. So I'll call the function with those values. Then the second stock: purchase $200, sale $210, dividend $30. Third stock: purchase $250, sale $300, dividend $40. Each requires a separate function call. I need to make sure all three are included in the tool calls. Let me check the parameters again to confirm they're correct. Yes, all required parameters are provided. No missing info here. So three function calls in total."}
