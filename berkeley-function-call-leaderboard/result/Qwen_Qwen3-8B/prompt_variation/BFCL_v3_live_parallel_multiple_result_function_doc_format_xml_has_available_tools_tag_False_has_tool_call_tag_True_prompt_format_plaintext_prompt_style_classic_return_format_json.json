The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function clone_repo requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory name might be the same as the repo name. Let's assume it's 'nodejs-welcome' unless specified otherwise. So, call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name set to that.\n\nOnce we have the analysis, step 2.1 requires creating a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The function create_a_docker_file needs the directory_name. Using the same directory name as before. But wait, the analysis might determine the language, which could influence the Dockerfile. However, the function doesn't take the language as a parameter, so maybe it's handled internally. So, call create_a_docker_file with the directory name.\n\nThen step 2.2 is creating Kubernetes YAMLs. The function create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. Again, same directory. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. The user didn't specify them, so use defaults. But the function might need the image name, which depends on the Dockerfile. However, since the Dockerfile is created in the same directory, maybe the image name is inferred. But since the parameters are optional, perhaps we can leave them out and let the function use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\nAfter creating these files, step 3 is adding all changed files to Git. The function push_git_changes_to_github has a parameter for directory_name. But wait, the function push_git_changes_to_github automatically adds changes. However, the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changes to Git\". So, maybe the push function handles adding, but the user might want to use git add first. However, the function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So, call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, and maybe a commit message and branch. The user didn't specify the commit message or branch, so leave them out or use defaults. But the function's parameters are optional. So, call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name.\n\nWait, but the steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" before committing. However, the push function might handle adding. But maybe the user wants to separate add and commit. However, the available functions don't have a git add function. The push function says it will automatically git add. So perhaps the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github, which includes adding. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" and step 4 is commit/push. Maybe the user wants to first add, then commit, then push. But the available functions don't have a separate add command. The push function does add. So maybe the steps are to push, which includes adding. But the user's step 3 and 4 might be redundant. However, the functions are as given. So, proceed with the push function.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo contents.\n3. Create Dockerfile based on analysis.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs based on analysis.\n5. Push changes.\n\nBut the user's steps are 1, 2 (which includes 2.1 and 2.2), 3, 4. So the functions needed are clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nWait, the user's step 3 is \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo. But the functions are in the given list. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's question is to compose function calls. The functions are provided, and the user's question is to be answered by the assistant. The functions are given in XML format. The user's question is to perform a series of steps, and the assistant must call the appropriate functions in order.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo: use clone_repo with repo_url.\n\n2. Analyse the repo contents: use analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\n3. Create Dockerfile: create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs: create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\n5. Add changes to Git: push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changes to Git\". However, the function push_git_changes_to_github handles adding and pushing. So, the correct sequence is to call the functions in order.\n\nNow, the parameters for each function:\n\nFor clone_repo, the repo_url is given. The destination is not specified, so it's optional. So the first function call is clone_repo with repo_url.\n\nThen, analyse_repo_contents requires directory_name. Assuming the cloned repo is in a directory named 'nodejs-welcome', so directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'. The other parameters are optional, so they can be omitted.\n\nFinally, push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'. The commit message and branch are optional, so they can be omitted.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url.\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, which is handled by push_git_changes_to_github. So the functions are called in that order."}

The get_relevant_classes function seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to true. The search_string should be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll need to call it twice, once for each method. Both require the class_name as AbstractCellHandler and the method_name as setCellValue and getCellValue respectively. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe the include_private parameter should be considered, but since the methods are overridden, perhaps they are public. But the user didn't specify, so maybe leave include_private as default (false) unless told otherwise.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error about getNumericValue() in CellResult. Maybe CellResult doesn't have that method, so they need to check if there's a related class that does. But the first part of the query is to find classes related to CellResult, so using get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true should help find possible classes. Then, checking those classes might reveal where getNumericValue() is defined or if there's a different approach needed.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes for \"CellResult\" with include_subdirectories true.

That's straightforward. I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size 5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format.

The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I can omit it or default to Celsius. However, since the user didn't mention the unit, perhaps it's better to leave it out.

So the assistant should make two separate calls. \n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are two instances of Events_3_FindEvents with different event_types."}

They want two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment at 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider for searching stylists. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so I'll use that as the city. They didn't mention unisex, so maybe the is_unisex parameter isn't required here. But the function allows it to be optional, so I can omit it or set it to 'dontcare'. Since the user didn't specify, I'll leave it out.\n\nNext, booking the appointment requires Services_1_BookAppointment. The parameters are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided 'Elegant Styles' as the stylist name, time 15:00, and date 2023-05-10. All required parameters are present here. \n\nWait, the stylist_name parameter's description says it's the full name of the stylist or the salon's name. Since the user mentioned the salon name, that's acceptable. So I can use 'Elegant Styles' as the stylist_name. The time is in 24-hour format, which matches the required format. The date is correctly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nSo I need to make two function calls. First, call FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and no is_unisex. Then call BookAppointment with the provided details. Let me check if all parameters are correctly formatted. Yes, everything seems in order. No missing parameters. The Weather function isn't needed here. Alright, time to structure the JSON calls."}
