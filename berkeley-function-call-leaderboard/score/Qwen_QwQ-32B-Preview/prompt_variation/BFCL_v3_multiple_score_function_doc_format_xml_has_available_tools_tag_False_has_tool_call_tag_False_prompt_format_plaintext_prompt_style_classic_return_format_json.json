If it is, then the sale price would be the cheapest price available at the moment. If it's not on sale, then the regular price would be the standard price to consider.\n\nGiven that, I need to use the `video_games.on_sale` function to check if the game is on sale, and if it is, I can assume that the sale price is cheaper than the regular price. However, the `video_games.on_sale` function only tells me if the game is on sale or not, but it doesn't provide the actual sale price. To get the actual price, I need to use the `video_games.store_price` function, which fetches the selling price of the game in the specified store and region.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Use the `video_games.on_sale` function to check if 'Assassin's Creed Valhalla' is on sale in the PlayStation Store in the United States.\n\n2. If the game is on sale, use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the current selling price, which would be the sale price.\n\n3. If the game is not on sale, use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the regular price.\n\n4. Since the question asks for the cheapest selling price, and assuming that the sale price is cheaper than the regular price when available, I can consider the sale price as the cheapest price if it's available. If not, the regular price would be the cheapest available price.\n\nGiven that, I need to make at least one function call to check if the game is on sale, and then potentially another call to get the price based on whether it's on sale or not.\n\nHowever, considering that the `video_games.store_price` function fetches the selling price regardless of whether it's on sale or not, and that the sale price is likely included if the game is on sale, I might be able to get the cheapest price directly from the `video_games.store_price` function.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should first check if the game is on sale, and then fetch the price accordingly.\n\nWait, looking back at the function descriptions:\n\n- `video_games.on_sale`: Checks if a particular game is currently on sale in a specific gaming platform store and in a specific region.\n\n- `video_games.store_price`: Fetches the selling price of a specified game in a particular gaming platform store and in a specific region.\n\nThe `video_games.store_price` function likely returns the current selling price, which would be the sale price if the game is on sale, or the regular price if it's not.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can just use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the current selling price, which should be the cheapest available price at the moment.\n\nBut to confirm, I should check if the game is on sale first, and then decide whether to fetch the sale price or the regular price.\n\nWait, but the `video_games.on_sale` function only tells me if it's on sale or not, but doesn't provide the actual sale price. The `video_games.store_price` function will give me the actual price, which should be the sale price if it's on sale.\n\nSo, perhaps the most efficient way is to first check if the game is on sale using `video_games.on_sale`, and then fetch the price using `video_games.store_price`.\n\nBut, if the game is not on sale, I still need to fetch the price using `video_games.store_price`.\n\nIn other words, I need to fetch the price regardless of whether it's on sale or not, but knowing if it's on sale might help me understand if the price I get is a sale price or the regular price.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the cheapest selling price, and assuming that the sale price is cheaper than the regular price, then fetching the price using `video_games.store_price` should give me the cheapest price available.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can just use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the current selling price, which should be the cheapest price available.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, I might want to check if it's on sale first, and then fetch the price accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `video_games.store_price` function already provides the cheapest price, considering any sales or discounts.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can just use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the current selling price.\n\nLet me consider the parameters required for each function:\n\nFor `video_games.on_sale`:\n\n- game_title: required, string\n\n- platform: required, string\n\n- region: optional, string, defaults to United States\n\nFor `video_games.store_price`:\n\n- game_title: required, string\n\n- platform: required, string\n\n- region: optional, string, defaults to United States\n\nIn this case, the region is specified as the United States, so I can use the default region.\n\nSo, for both functions, I need to provide the game title and the platform.\n\nGiven that, I can prepare the parameters accordingly.\n\nNow, considering the sequence of function calls:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Call `video_games.on_sale` with game_title='Assassin's Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'\n\n2. If the result is True (on sale), then call `video_games.store_price` with the same parameters to get the sale price.\n\n3. If the result is False (not on sale), then call `video_games.store_price` with the same parameters to get the regular price.\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Directly call `video_games.store_price` with game_title='Assassin's Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States' to get the current selling price, which should be the cheapest available price.\n\nConsidering that Option 2 is more straightforward and likely to give me the cheapest price directly, I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, I will make a single function call to `video_games.store_price` with the specified parameters.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo determine the cheapest selling price for 'Assassin's Creed Valhalla' in the PlayStation Store in the United States, we can utilize the `video_games.store_price` function. This function fetches the current selling price of the specified game in the given gaming platform store and region, which would be the sale price if the game is on sale or the regular price if it is not.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Function Selection**: Use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the current selling price of the game.\n2. **Parameters**: Provide the game title, platform, and region as parameters to the function.\n3. **Assumption**: The `video_games.store_price` function returns the cheapest available price, considering any ongoing sales or discounts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n[{\n  \"function\": \"video_games.store_price\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"game_title\": \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\",\n    \"platform\": \"PlayStation\",\n    \"region\": \"United States\"\n  }\n}]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function**: `video_games.store_price` is used to fetch the current selling price of the game.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `game_title`: 'Assassin's Creed Valhalla'\n  - `platform`: 'PlayStation'\n  - `region`: 'United States'\n- **Output**: The function will return the current selling price of the game in the specified store and region, which is the cheapest price available at the time of the query.", "model_result_decoded": [{"video_games.store_price": {"game_title": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla", "platform": "PlayStation", "region": "United States"}}], "possible_answer": [{"video_games.store_price": {"game_title": ["Assassins Creed Valhalla"], "platform": ["PlayStation", "PS"], "region": ["United States", "US", ""]}}]}
