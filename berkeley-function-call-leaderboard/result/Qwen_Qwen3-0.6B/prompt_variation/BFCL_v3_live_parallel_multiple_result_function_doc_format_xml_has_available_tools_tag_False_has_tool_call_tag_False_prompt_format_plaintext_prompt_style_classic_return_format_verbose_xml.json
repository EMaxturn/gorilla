The specialInstructions might be \"without anchovies\" as a note.\n\nThen, for the drink order, the drink_id is 123.

The parameters needed are repo_url, which is given as git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination is optional, so I'll leave that out.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo's contents. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory_name. The user hasn't specified the directory, but since the clone was done, the directory should be the same as the cloned repo. So I'll use the directory name from the clone operation.\n\nThen, they want to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The directory here should be the same as the cloned repo. For Kubernetes, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user hasn't provided all these details, so I'll need to make assumptions. Maybe the default values for image_name and replicas are acceptable.\n\nAfter that, adding the changed files to Git.

The force_push is optional, so I'll leave it as false.\n\nFinally, committing and pushing the changes. The push function again needs directory_name and force_push. Again, default values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly filled. Let me check each step again to ensure no missing parameters.

They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the get_relevant_classes function seems relevant. The parameters for that function include a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case sensitivity parameter can be set to false if the user wants case-insensitive search, but since the error mentions 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is better. The include_subdirectories parameter should be true to include subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can be used here. The parameters required are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The class_name here is 'AbstractCellHandler', the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nWait, the user is overriding these methods in their code. So the get_signature function should retrieve the signatures of those methods. Also, the get_relevant_classes function will give the list of classes related to 'CellResult', which might include 'CellResult' and others.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search string 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with the method names. That should cover the user's needs."}

The area would then be 5^2 = 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a location parameter. The user mentioned Queenstown Singapore, so I should set location to \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The unit isn't specified, so maybe leave it out as it's optional. So the second function call would be get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\nI need to make sure both function calls are made.
