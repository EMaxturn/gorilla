However, the available function `video_games.store_price` returns the selling price for a specific game on a platform in a region. It does not by itself compare prices across different regions or platforms. But the question specifies the platform (PlayStation) and the region (United States). Therefore, we are only looking for the price in that specific region and platform.\n\nSince the question does not imply comparing multiple regions or platforms, we can directly call `video_games.store_price` for the given game, platform, and region.\n\nThe function `video_games.store_price` requires:\n- `game_title` (string): The title of the video game -> 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n- `platform` (string): The gaming platform -> 'PlayStation'\n- `region` (string): The region, with default to United States. Since the user specifies United States, we can set it to 'United States'. However, note that the function says the region defaults to United States. But to be explicit, we can set it.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a parameter `region` that is optional and defaults to United States. So we can omit it? However, the user explicitly said \"in the United States\", so we can include it to be clear.\n\nAlternatively, we can call without the region and it will default to United States. However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the region is provided in the question. So we should include it.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` has `region` as an optional parameter with a default. So we can either include it or not. To be safe and explicit, we will include it.\n\nTherefore, we will call:\n  video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. But note that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price in the given region. Since we are only querying one region and one platform, that price is the only one we have. Therefore, that price is the cheapest (and only) in that context.\n\nBut what if the game is sold at multiple price points in the same region? For example, standard edition and deluxe edition? The function does not specify an edition. The description of the function says: \"Fetches the selling price of a specified game\". We assume that the function returns the base price of the game? Or the lowest available edition? The function does not specify. Since the question asks for the \"cheapest selling price\", we must assume that the function returns the lowest available price for the game in that store. Alternatively, if the function returns multiple editions, we might need to compare? But the function returns a single price? Actually, the function does not specify the return type. However, the problem states that we have to use the provided functions.\n\nGiven the available functions, we can only call `video_games.store_price` and hope that it returns the base price or the lowest available price. Alternatively, if the function returns multiple prices for different editions, we might need to process it? But the function does not have an edition parameter. So we assume the function returns the price of the base game or the lowest available price.\n\nTherefore, we will call the function with the given parameters.\n\nLet's compose the function call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"game_title\" value=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"platform\" value=\"PlayStation\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"region\" value=\"United States\" type=\"string\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" - but period is not required.\n\n So both are acceptable. I think including the optional parameter when we have a specific intention (like current -> daily) is better.\n\n But note: the function might be implemented to use the default when the parameter is absent. We are not forced to set optional parameters.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and we are allowed to include any parameters we want.\n\n Let me choose to set the period to 'Daily' to be explicit.\n\n Therefore, the function call will be:\n\n   paint_color.trends(room=\"Living room\", period=\"Daily\")\n\n But note: the function name in the call is exactly as provided: 'paint_color.trends'\n\n Now, write the tool call in the required XML format."}

The task says \"modern sculpture exhibition\". \n        So we can set art_form as \"sculpture\" but note the term \"modern\" might be part of the art form? \n        However, the function does not have a parameter for era or style. We can only provide the art_form as \"sculpture\".\n        Alternatively, we can try to include the style in the art_form string? But the description says \"art form\" and example is \"sculpture\".\n        Since the function does not have a style parameter, we must rely on the art_form. We can set it as \"modern sculpture\", but note the function might not support that.\n        However, the function description says: \"the form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture\". \n        We are not sure if it supports compound terms. But the task says \"modern sculpture\", so we can try to use \"sculpture\" and hope that the system interprets \"modern\" as part of the theme?\n        Alternatively, note that the function has a parameter for user_ratings. We are asked for \"top rated\", so we can set user_ratings to 'high'.\n        Also, the month: we are to look for the upcoming month. The function says: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" \n        So we can leave out the month? But the task says \"upcoming month\". Since the default returns upcoming events, we can skip the month.\n\n   But note: the required parameters are ['location', 'art_form'].\n\n   We are also asked for top rated. The user_ratings parameter has an enum: ['low', 'average', 'high'] and default is 'high'. \n   Since we want top rated, we can set user_ratings to 'high'. But note: the function description says \"Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\", \n   so if we set it to 'high', it will return exhibitions with high ratings. That matches.\n\n   So we can set:\n        location: \"New York, NY\"\n        art_form: \"sculpture\"   (or maybe \"modern sculpture\"? But the function might not recognize that. We'll go with \"sculpture\" and hope that the system returns modern ones if they are the top rated? \n        Alternatively, note that the function says \"most popular exhibitions\", and we are filtering by art_form. We don't have a style, so we must rely on the art_form being sculpture and then the system returns the top rated ones which might be modern? \n        But the task says \"modern sculpture\". Since the function doesn't have a style parameter, we cannot specify modern. We might have to accept that we are getting sculpture exhibitions and then the top rated ones might be modern? \n        However, we can try to include the word \"modern\" in the art_form? The function doesn't specify that it must be a single word. Let's try: art_form = \"modern sculpture\"\n\n   But note: the function might not support that. Alternatively, we can leave it as \"sculpture\" and then in the results we might have to filter by modern? But we cannot do that because we are only allowed to call the function.\n\n   Since we cannot control beyond the parameters, we set art_form to \"sculpture\". We hope that the system returns the top rated ones and that they are modern? \n   Alternatively, note that the task says \"modern sculpture\", so perhaps we can interpret modern as a style that is commonly associated with recent times? \n   But the function doesn't have a year or era parameter. So we do the best we can.\n\n   We are also asked for the upcoming month. The function parameter 'month' is a string and the default returns upcoming events. So we don't need to specify month.\n\n   Therefore, we call:\n        find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n   But note: the task says \"top rated\", and the function's default for user_ratings is already 'high'. So we could also omit user_ratings? \n   However, to be explicit, we set it to 'high'.\n\n   However, note: the task says \"top rated\", which might imply the highest rating? The function's default is 'high', which is the highest threshold? \n   So it should be acceptable.\n\n   Let's call the function with:\n        location: \"New York, NY\"\n        art_form: \"sculpture\"\n        user_ratings: \"high\"\n\n   We are not specifying month because the default is upcoming.\n\n   But note: the function might return multiple exhibitions? The description says \"Locate the most popular exhibitions\". So it returns a list? \n   We are asked for the top rated. Since we set user_ratings to 'high', it should return only high rated ones, and then we get the most popular? \n   The function does not have a parameter to limit the number of results. So we assume it returns the top ones.\n\n   We are only allowed to output the function call. We do not have a function to get more details? But note there is also get_sculpture_info, but that is for a specific artist's sculpture, not exhibitions.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n   <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"art_form\" value=\"sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"user_ratings\" value=\"high\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n   </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n   However, note: the art_form we are using is \"sculpture\". The task says \"modern sculpture\". We are not capturing \"modern\". \n   But there is no other function that can help. So we have to rely on the function to interpret the art_form appropriately? \n   Alternatively, we might try to set art_form to \"modern sculpture\", but the function might not recognize that. \n\n   Let me reexamine the function parameters: the art_form is a string and the example was \"sculpture\". It does not say it must be a single word. \n   So we can try:\n\n        art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n   Why not? It might be that the backend can handle that. So we change:\n\n        <param name=\"art_form\" value=\"modern sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n   But note: the function might not have any exhibitions with the exact art_form string \"modern sculpture\". It might be better to stick to the known example? \n   However, the task says \"modern sculpture\", so we are being more precise.\n\n   I think we should try to use \"modern sculpture\" to get the intended results.\n\n   Therefore, we change the art_form to \"modern sculpture\".\n\n   Also note: the location is given as \"New York\". The function expects a city and state? The example is \"New York, NY\". So we use that.\n\n   Final call:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n   <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"art_form\" value=\"modern sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"user_ratings\" value=\"high\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n   </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>"}
