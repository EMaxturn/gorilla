The parameters are all provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe default to 2 decimals. So the function call should include all three parameters. I don't see any missing parameters here.

But maybe the function is designed to return the price, and the user wants the current price. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the cheapest, but the available functions don't include a function to find the cheapest. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the cheapest selling price. But the functions provided don't have a way to find the cheapest. The store_price function gives the current price, but not necessarily the cheapest. So maybe the user is expecting the current price, but the question is about the cheapest. However, the functions available don't have a way to find the cheapest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the store_price function returns the price, and the user wants that. But the question says \"cheapest selling price,\" which might imply the lowest price, but the function might not provide that. However, the function's description says it fetches the selling price, which could be the current price. So perhaps the user is asking for the current price, and the answer is the result of calling store_price with the parameters.\n\nSo, the parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I need to call video_games.store_price with those parameters. \n\nBut the user is asking for the cheapest, but the function might not return the cheapest.

The user is asking to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about acceleration, but the user wants the final speed. \n\nWait, the functions provided are kinematics.calculate_acceleration and kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check what each does. \n\nThe calculate_speed_from_rest function takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration. But the parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). \n\nBut the user's question involves acceleration. However, the calculate_speed_from_rest function might be the right one here. Because if the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0, and the function uses distance and time to calculate speed. But wait, the formula for speed when starting from rest is v = (2 * distance) / time. But the function's parameters are distance and time. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). So if the user provides distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0, then the function would calculate speed. But the user is asking for acceleration. However, the question is about finding the speed, not acceleration. \n\nBut the user's question says \"Find out how fast an object was going if it started from rest and traveled a distance of 20 meters over 4 seconds due to a constant acceleration?\" So they want the final speed. \n\nSo the calculate_speed_from_rest function is the right one here. Because it's designed for objects starting from rest. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. Since initial_speed is 0, the function would compute the speed. \n\nBut wait, the function's description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration. So the formula would be v = (2 * distance) / time. Let me check with the parameters. If distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds, then 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. So the speed would be 10 m/s. \n\nBut the user is asking for acceleration. However, the question is about speed, not acceleration. The user might have confused the terms, but the question is to find the speed. \n\nSo the correct function to call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nBut wait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (int, default 0). So the user's input has distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. So the function call would be:\n\n{\"function\": \"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\", \"parameters\": {\"distance\": 20, \"time\": 4, \"initial_speed\": 0}}\n\nBut the user's question mentions that the acceleration is constant. However, the function calculate_speed_from_rest is designed to compute speed given distance and time, assuming constant acceleration. So even though the user mentions acceleration, the function is designed to compute speed. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

I remember that when two gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. The formula is something like (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2) = T_final. Where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature.

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability.\n\nThe dice_roll_probability function seems relevant here. Let me check its parameters. The function requires desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The user is asking about two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default sides_per_die is probably 6, which is standard for a die. The desired_sum is 7. So I need to call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, and sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the sides_per_die is optional? The function's description says the default is 1, but usually dice have 6 sides. Wait, the function's parameters have sides_per_die as an argument with a default? Let me check again. The function's parameters say \"sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die. Default is 1\". Oh, wait, that's not right. Wait, the default for sides_per_die is 1? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Because if the default is 1, then for two dice, each with 1 side, the sum would be 2. But that's not the case. So maybe the default is actually 6? Or maybe the function's description has a mistake. But the user is asking about two standard dice, so sides_per_die should be 6. But the function's parameters say the default is 1. That's confusing. But the user is asking about two dice, so I need to specify sides_per_die as 6. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6.

But I need to check if the function allows that. The description says the category can be things like gender, race, age.
