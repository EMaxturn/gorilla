Let me translate it:\n\n- \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\" means \"Living room, air conditioner, turn on\" or \"execute\".\n\n- \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\" means \"Bedroom, air purifier, stop it please\".\n\nSo, the user wants to control two appliances: turn on the air conditioner in the living room and stop the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, I need to see which one matches this.\n\nThe relevant function is: 'ControlAppliance.execute'\n\nDescription: \"This function is designed for controlling a home appliance, checking its current status and settings, as well as monitoring indoor air properties like air quality and temperature. For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nParameters: It requires 'command', which is a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\n\nExamples: \n\n- '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589' for activating cooling without specifying the room.\n\n- '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine in the utility room.\n\nThe user's request has two parts, but the function seems to be designed for one command at a time, based on the examples. Each call to 'ControlAppliance.execute' takes a single 'command' string.\n\nSo, I need to make separate calls for each command.\n\nFirst command: \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\" \u2013 This matches exactly with one of the enum values.\n\nSecond command: \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\" \u2013 This isn't exactly in the enum, but the enum is just examples. The description says: \"The command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\"\n\nThe enum provided is: ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0']\n\nSo, \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\" follows the same format, even if it's not in the enum. I think it's acceptable.\n\nI should call 'ControlAppliance.execute' twice: once for each command.\n\nMy response should only include the function calls in the specified format.\n\nFormat: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)...]\n\nSo, for the first one: ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589')\n\nFor the second: ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0')\n\nI need to output them in a list.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

The repo is 'nodejs-welcome', so it might be cloned as a subdirectory.\n\nIn Git, cloning git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git would typically create a directory named 'nodejs-welcome' in the current directory.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume it's 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo, after cloning, call: analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nThen, based on the analysis, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML.\n\nThe functions for that are:\n\n- create_a_docker_file: Requires 'directory_name', which would be the same, 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: Also requires 'directory_name'.\n\nThe user said \"based on the analysis\", but the functions don't take analysis as input; they just use the directory.\n\nI have to call them after analysis, even if the functions themselves don't depend on the analysis output.\n\nFinally, add changes and push.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github will automatically git add all changes, so I can just call that with the necessary params.\n\nIt requires 'directory_name', and optionally commit_message, etc.\n\nSo, sequence of function calls:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // Using defaults for other params\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='something')  // User didn't specify, so use default or a generic one.\n\nThe user said: \"commit / push to repo\", and in the function, commit_message defaults to 'Update changes'.\n\nIn step 3: \"add all changed file to git changes\" \u2013 but push_git_changes_to_github does that automatically.\n\nI can just call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\"\n\nIn one response, I might need to output all the function calls I plan to make.\n\nThe prompt: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)...]\"\n\nIt seems I can list multiple in one response.\n\nSo, I'll output all of them in sequence.\n\nFinal list:\n\n- clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n- analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n- create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, I might want to specify parameters, but since the user didn't, I'll use defaults.\n\nOne potential issue: Does the analysis function return something that I need to use? In this setup, no, because I'm just calling functions sequentially.\n\nAlright, let's format it."}

It seems suitable for the second request.\n\n- generate_human_image: This is specifically for generating images of human subjects, which might fit since the description involves a woman.\n\n- multilingual_llm: For generating text in non-English languages, not relevant here.\n\n- english_llm: For English text generation, but the user wants real-time information, which this doesn't provide as it excludes post-2022 data.\n\nFor the first part: The user wants real-time information on events since October 2021, but only after 2022. The search_engine.query can handle this because it can search the internet and filter for post-2022 information.\n\nThe prompt they gave is: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'. This seems incomplete or typo-ridden; it should probably be \"since October 2021\". I need to use it as is or correct it slightly for the function call.\n\nThey say \"Please check for this verbatim,\" which might mean to search exactly as stated, but I'll use the prompt as provided.\n\nFor the search, I can call: search_engine.query with prompt set to the user's query and include_after_year=True.\n\nThe user said: \"Include only information published after the year 2022.\" So, yes, set include_after_year=True.\n\nFor the second part: Generating an image. The description is for a digital painting of a masked woman, which involves a human subject. So, both generate_image and generate_human_image could work, but generate_human_image is more specific to human subjects.\n\ngenerate_human_image: \"Generates a digital image of a human subject... tailored to create images representing different human demographics such as girls, boys, women, men, and children.\"\n\nThis fits perfectly. So, I should use generate_human_image with the provided prompt.\n\nI need to format the response with function calls only, in the specified format.\n\nSince there are two distinct requests, I should make two separate function calls in my response.\n\nThe format is: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, my response should be something like:\n\n[search_engine.query(prompt=\"significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021\", include_after_year=True), generate_human_image(prompt=\"a digital painting of a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style\")]\n\nFor generate_human_image, the prompt should be the description provided.\n\nI should check if all required parameters are present.

I could use this to congratulate Shishir.\n\n- pause_heartbeats: Not relevant.\n\n- message_chatgpt: For asking ChatGPT, but that's not about previous conversations.\n\n- core_memory_append/replace: For editing memory, not searching.\n\n- recall_memory_search: This searches the prior conversation history for a specified string. That sounds perfect for finding information from previous conversations.\n\n- archival_memory_insert/search: For archival memory, which is for long-term storage, not necessarily prior conversations.\n\n- http_request: For external HTTP calls, not internal conversations.\n\nSo, for the first part, \"find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations\", I should use recall_memory_search. I need to search for something related to \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nThe function requires a 'query' parameter, which is the search string. I could use a query like \"Shishir's birthday\" or something similar.\n\nAfter searching, I need to congratulate him regardless. That means, even if I don't find the birthday, I should still send the message.\n\nThe user said \"find out ... and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\". So, I need to perform the search first, and then send the message.\n\nIn this system, I have to output function calls one at a time. I should chain them if necessary.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

But I can't make decisions based on the result in this response; I have to output the functions to call.\n\nOnce I call a function, the system will execute it and then I can respond based on that in the next turn. But the prompt says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.

But I don't know the result of the search yet.\n\nThe user wants me to send the message regardless, so I could just send the message after searching, or even without, but to be thorough, I should search first.\n\nThe exact request: \"find out ... and then congratulate him ... regardless\"\n\nTo fulfill both, I should call the search function, and then call send_message.\n\nIn one response, I can output multiple function calls.\n\nThe format allows: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, I can call both in sequence.\n\nFirst, call recall_memory_search with a query like \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nThen, call send_message with the congratulatory message.\n\nFor send_message, I need to specify the message and optionally recipient and urgent.\n\nThe message should be \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir.\n\nRecipient: It defaults to 'default@example.com', but I should specify it if possible. The user mentioned Shishir, so perhaps use \"Shishir\" as the recipient, assuming it's an identifier.\n\nThe description says: \"The identifier of the recipient. This could be a username, phone number, or an email address.\"\n\nI'll assume \"Shishir\" could be a username.\n\nSo, for send_message: message = \"Happy Birthday!\", recipient = \"Shishir\", and urgent could be False or True; maybe set to True for birthday.\n\nThe user didn't specify urgency, so default to False.\n\nNow, sequence: First, search for the birthday to \"find out\", then send the message regardless.\n\nIn my response, I'll output both calls.\n\nFinally, output in the exact format: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\nSo, something like: [recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"Shishir\")]\n\nThat seems appropriate."}
