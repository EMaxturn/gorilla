The user needs an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There are two functions: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum list (plus, comfort, black). The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So all parameters are met for uber.ride.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2. The loc here is supposed to be 'City, State', but the user provided a full address with street. The description says the loc should be like 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'. The user's address is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which includes the street. So maybe uber.ride2 isn't the right fit because it doesn't require the street address. Also, uber.ride2's parameters are loc, type, and time has a default of 10. But since the user specified 10 minutes, which matches the default, but the loc format might be an issue. \n\nSince the user provided a full street address, uber.ride is more appropriate because it requires the full address. Uber.ride2 seems to be for a different purpose, maybe related to weather? The description says \"T\u00ecm th\u1eddi ti\u1ebft \u1edf \u0111\u1ecba \u0111i\u1ec3m\" which translates to \"Find weather at location\". That might be a mistake in the function name. But regardless, the user is asking for a ride, so the correct function is uber.ride.\n\nSo the correct function call would be uber.ride with loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='plus', time=10."}

Ha Noi is a city in Vietnam, so the correct format should be 'Ha Noi, Vietnam'. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly specified. The uber.ride function isn't relevant here. Since the user didn't mention the country, but Ha Noi is a well-known city in Vietnam, it's safe to assume the country is Vietnam. So I'll call api.weather with loc='Ha Noi, Vietnam'."}

The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user provided the keyword and format, and max_results. The language isn't specified, but the default is EN. However, since the keyword is in Korean, maybe the user prefers results in Korean. Wait, the language parameter options are EN, ES, FR, DE. There's no Korean option. Hmm, but the default is EN. But the user might want the results in Korean. But the tool's language parameter doesn't include Korean. So maybe the search will still return relevant results in Korean even if the language is set to EN? Or maybe the tool can handle Korean keywords regardless. The user's instruction is to search with the Korean keyword, so perhaps the tool can process that. Since the language parameter doesn't have Korean, but the keyword is in Korean, maybe the search will still work. The user didn't specify the language, so maybe we should use the default EN, but the results might still be in Korean if the search engine returns them. Alternatively, maybe the tool's language parameter affects the interface language, not the content. But the user wants the results in text format, so perhaps it's okay. The main thing is to use HNA_WQA.search with the keyword \"\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780\", result_format as text, max_results 10. The language is set to EN by default, but since the keyword is in Korean, the search might still retrieve Korean results. So the correct function call is HNA_WQA.search with those parameters."}

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include http_request, which can make a web request. Maybe I can use that to search for his birthday. But wait, the user might not have provided any API details or URLs to query. The http_request function requires a URL and method. Without knowing where to get this information, I can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use a search function. Looking at the tools, there's archival_memory_search and recall_memory_search. But if the birthday isn't in the memory, those won't help. The user hasn't provided any prior conversation history, so recall_memory_search might not have the data. Archival memory would also need prior insertion.\n\nSince I don't have access to external data sources like a database or API endpoint for birthdays, I can't retrieve this information. The functions available don't include a way to search the web directly unless the user provides a specific URL. Therefore, I can't find Shishir Patil's birthday with the current tools.\n\nNext, the user wants to send a congratulation message. The send_message function is available, but I need the recipient's details. The user hasn't provided Shishir Patil's contact information, like an email or phone number. The send_message function requires a recipient parameter, which defaults to 'default@example.com', but that's probably not correct. Without the actual recipient details, sending the message isn't possible.\n\nSo, the main issues are: 1) No way to retrieve the birthday without external data sources, and 2) No recipient information to send the message. I should inform the user that I can't perform these actions with the current tools and missing parameters. However, the user instructed to only return function calls if possible. Since the necessary parameters are missing, I should point that out."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for a specific period. They provided details like the account number, name, start and end dates, balances, deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, the account number, the account type is checking, the full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. For the transaction_overview, they need total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned $7,132.76 in deposits and $5,927.40 in withdrawals. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So that fits.\n\nThen, the user also wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. So maybe we can't use that function unless we get the transactions from another function. However, the Alltransactions function can retrieve transactions for a statement period. The user's period is October 2019, so statement_period would be '2019-10'. But the user hasn't specified if they want pending transactions, so the default is False. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe we need to call Alltransactions first to get them. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only call functions based on the parameters provided. Since the user hasn't given the individual transactions, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can't be used unless we first retrieve the transactions via Alltransactions. But the user hasn't provided the necessary data for that. Wait, the user is asking to include a summary of transactions for the period, but they haven't given the list of transactions. So perhaps the assistant needs to call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019, then use that data in the transaction_summary.generate. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transaction data, so maybe the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to generate the summary using the totals provided. But the transaction_summary.generate requires individual transactions. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. \n\nWait, the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, but not the individual transactions. So maybe the assistant can't generate a detailed transaction summary without the individual transactions. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019, then use that data in the transaction_summary.generate. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transaction data, so the assistant can't simulate that. Therefore, maybe the assistant can only use the BankStatementOverView function and note that the transaction summary requires more data. But the user is asking to include the summary, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the available data. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to compute some totals, but the user already provided the totals. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user provided all those values. So the assistant can call BankStatementOverView with those parameters. Then, for the transaction summary, since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe the assistant can't generate it. But the user is asking to include it. So perhaps the assistant should call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019, then pass them to transaction_summary.generate. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't do that. Therefore, maybe the assistant can only provide the BankStatementOverView and mention that the transaction summary isn't possible without the individual transactions. But the user might expect that the Alltransactions function is used to retrieve them. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only use the functions provided and the parameters given by the user. Since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't call Alltransactions because that would require the statement_period, which the user did provide (October 2019). Wait, the user did specify the statement period as October 1 to 31, 2019, so the statement_period would be '2019-10'. So maybe the assistant should first call Alltransactions with statement_period='2019-10' to get the transactions, then use that data in the transaction_summary.generate. But the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so the assistant can't simulate that. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the BankStatementOverView and note that the transaction summary requires the Alltransactions function, but since the user hasn't provided the data, it can't be generated. However, the user is asking to include the summary, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the available data. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to compute the totals, but the user already provided them. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant can call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. For the transaction summary, since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, the assistant can't generate it. However, the user might expect the assistant to use Alltransactions to get the transactions. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't do that. Therefore, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and perhaps mention that the transaction summary isn't possible without the individual transactions. But according to the task, the assistant should only return the function calls. So the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and maybe Alltransactions to retrieve the transactions, then use them in transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't proceed beyond calling Alltransactions. However, the user's question is to provide the overview and include the summary, so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls. Therefore, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019.\n2. Use those transactions in transaction_summary.generate along with the provided totals and dates.\n3. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't simulate the Alltransactions response. Therefore, the assistant should call Alltransactions first, then use the result in the transaction_summary.generate. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only make the function calls based on the user's input. The user provided the statement period, so the assistant can call Alltransactions with statement_period='2019-10'. Then, assuming that returns the transactions, the assistant can proceed. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't know. Therefore, the assistant should make the function calls as per the available parameters. So the correct approach is to first call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then use them in the transaction_summary.generate, and also call BankStatementOverView. However, the user's question is a single turn, so the assistant needs to make all necessary function calls in one go. But the assistant can only return the function calls, not the results. Therefore, the assistant should return the calls to Alltransactions, BankStatementOverView, and transaction_summary.generate (once Alltransactions is called). But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the transaction_summary.generate can't be called yet. Therefore, the assistant should first call Alltransactions and BankStatementOverView. Then, in a subsequent turn, once Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant can call transaction_summary.generate. But in the current turn, the assistant can only make the initial calls. Therefore, the correct function calls are Alltransactions and BankStatementOverView. Then, in the next turn, after getting the transactions, call transaction_summary.generate. But the user's question is a single request, so the assistant needs to handle it in one turn. However, the assistant can only return the function calls, not the results. Therefore, the assistant should return the calls to Alltransactions and BankStatementOverView, and then in the next step, once the transactions are retrieved, call transaction_summary.generate. But since the user is asking for both the overview and the summary, the assistant needs to make all necessary calls. However, given the current parameters, the assistant can only make the calls to Alltransactions and BankStatementOverView. The transaction_summary.generate requires the transactions array, which isn't provided, so it can't be called yet. Therefore, the correct function calls are Alltransactions and BankStatementOverView."}

Looking at the enum options, there's 'moderate' which is the default. So I should set price_range to 'moderate'. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires it in 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and the state is NY, the location should be 'New York, NY'. \n\nThe category isn't specified, but the function requires it. Wait, the user didn't mention a specific cuisine. Hmm, maybe I need to leave that out? Wait, no, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' as a required field. The user didn't specify a category, so this is a problem. But maybe I can choose a general category? Wait, the enum for category includes 'American' or 'California' but maybe the user didn't specify. Since the category is required, but the user hasn't provided it, I might need to make an assumption or ask for clarification. However, the user hasn't provided a category, so perhaps I should use a default? Wait, looking at the function's parameters, 'category' is required, so I can't omit it. The user's query doesn't specify a category, so this is a missing parameter. But maybe the user is okay with any category as long as it meets the other criteria. Wait, but the function requires it.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave it open, but the function requires it. Since the user hasn't provided a category, I can't proceed without it. Wait, but the user might have made a mistake. Let me check again. The user's message says \"find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York.\" No mention of cuisine. So the category is missing. But the function requires it. Therefore, the user's request is incomplete. However, maybe the assistant can choose a default category. Wait, the function's parameters don't have a default for category. So the assistant must specify one. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the assistant should pick a general one like 'American' or 'Bistro'? Alternatively, maybe the assistant can't proceed without that info. But the user might expect that the category is optional. Wait, the function's required parameters are category and location. So the assistant must include category. Since the user didn't provide it, the assistant can't proceed. But maybe the assistant can ask for clarification. However, the current task is to make a function call if possible. Since the user didn't specify the category, the assistant can't make the call. Wait, but maybe the user intended to leave it open. But the function requires it. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the category is missing. However, the user might have intended to use a general category. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a placeholder. Wait, the function requires the category, so the assistant must include it. Since the user didn't provide it, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the category is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default category. Wait, the function's parameters don't have a default for category. So the assistant must include it. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. However, the user might have intended to use a general category. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a common category like 'American' as a default. Let me check the enum options again. The category has options like 'American', 'Bistro', etc. Maybe 'American' is a safe default. So the assistant can proceed by assuming the category is 'American' and make the function call. But the user didn't specify, so this is an assumption. However, given the constraints, perhaps that's the best approach. So the function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with category='American', location='New York, NY', price_range='moderate', has_seating_outdoors=True. The has_vegetarian_options is not mentioned, so use the default of False. That should cover the user's request."}

The user mentioned concerts or plays, so both are covered. The city is Las Vegas, which I should format as 'Las Vegas, NV'. The date is 2023-03-06. Let me make sure all parameters are included. Yes, event_type is set to 'Music' and 'Theater' but the enum only allows one value. Wait, the function's parameters say event_type is a string with enum ['Music', 'Theater']. So maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each type. Or does it accept both? No, the enum is a single choice. So perhaps the user wants both, but the function can only handle one at a time. Hmm. But the user's question says \"cultural events, like concerts or plays\", so maybe they want both categories. Since the function can't take both in one call, I might need to make two separate calls. But the system might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle 'any' if not specified, but the required parameters are event_type. Wait, the required parameters are event_type and city. The date is optional with a default of 'any'. Wait, looking back: the required parameters for Events_3_FindEvents are event_type and city. The date is optional, defaulting to 'any'. But the user specified March 6th. So I need to set date to '2023-03-06'. But the event_type is a single enum value. So to cover both Music and Theater, I need to make two separate calls. However, the user might expect both types. Since the function can't handle multiple event types in one call, I'll have to call it twice. But the current turn allows only one tool call. Wait, the Multi-turn Behavior says to continue outputting functions until the task is done. So in the first turn, I can call for Music, then in the next turn, call for Theater. But the user's question is in one turn. Wait, the user's initial question is a single query. The assistant is supposed to handle it in the current turn. If the assistant needs to make multiple calls, it can do so in subsequent turns. But the user's question is a one-time input. So perhaps the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents once with event_type as 'Music' and then again with 'Theater', but since the user is asking for both, maybe the function can accept a list? But according to the parameters, event_type is a string with enum, so only one value. Therefore, the correct approach is to make two separate function calls. However, the assistant can only return one tool call per turn. So in the first turn, the assistant would call for Music, then in the next turn, the system would prompt again, and the assistant would call for Theater. But the user's question is a single input. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should make both calls in the same response. Wait, the instructions say that in the <TOOLCALL> section, you can have multiple function calls separated by commas. So maybe the assistant can make two calls in one turn. Let me check the example. The example shows that multiple functions can be called in one toolcall. So in this case, the assistant can call Events_3_FindEvents twice, once for each event_type. So the correct tool calls would be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Music', city='Las Vegas, NV', date='2023-03-06'), Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Theater', city='Las Vegas, NV', date='2023-03-06')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat way, both Music and Theater events are covered. The parameters are correctly formatted with city as 'Las Vegas, NV' and date as '2023-03-06'. The user specified March 6th, 2023, so the date is correct. The city is Las Vegas, which is in Nevada, so 'Las Vegas, NV' is the correct format. Therefore, the two function calls should retrieve both types of events."}

There's Hotels_2_SearchHouse and Hotels_2_BookHouse. The user is asking to book a house, but before booking, they might need to search for available houses. However, the user's message directly says they need to book, so maybe they already have a house in mind. But since the BookHouse function requires the same parameters as SearchHouse plus check-in and check-out dates, maybe the assistant should first search for available houses that meet the criteria. Wait, the user hasn't specified any additional criteria like laundry service or rating, so maybe the SearchHouse function can be called with default parameters except for where_to and number_of_adults. \n\nWait, the BookHouse function requires where_to, number_of_adults, check_in_date, and check_out_date. The user provided all these: where_to is Austin, TX, number_of_adults is 4, check_in is 05/12/2023, check_out is 05/18/2023. So maybe the assistant can directly call BookHouse. But usually, you need to search first to find available options. However, the user might not have specified a particular house, so perhaps the correct approach is to first search for houses that can accommodate 4 adults, then book one. But the user's instruction is to book, so maybe the assistant should proceed to book using the given parameters. However, the BookHouse function might require a specific house ID or something, which isn't provided here. Wait, looking at the parameters for BookHouse, the required parameters are where_to, number_of_adults, check_in_date, check_out_date. There's no house ID, so maybe the function is designed to book based on those parameters without needing a specific house. That might not be standard, but according to the given functions, BookHouse can be called directly. \n\nBut the problem is that typically, you need to search first to select a house, then book it. Since the user hasn't mentioned a specific house, perhaps the correct flow is to first call SearchHouse with the location, number_of_adults=4, and default parameters for other optional fields. Then, once the available houses are found, proceed to book. However, the user's message is a single request to book, so maybe the assistant should first search and then book. But in the current setup, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. Since the user hasn't provided all the necessary info for booking (like which house), maybe the assistant should first search. But according to the given functions, the BookHouse function doesn't require a house ID, just the location, dates, and number of adults. That's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, looking at the parameters for BookHouse: the required parameters are where_to, number_of_adults, check_in_date, check_out_date. So the function is designed to book a house at a location without specifying which house. That might mean that the system automatically selects a house based on the parameters, but that's not typical. However, given the functions provided, the assistant can call BookHouse directly with the given parameters. The user's request includes all required parameters for BookHouse. So the correct function call would be Hotels_2_BookHouse with where_to='Austin, TX', number_of_adults=4, check_in_date='05/12/2023', check_out_date='05/18/2023'. \n\nBut maybe the user needs to search first to ensure there are available houses.

Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But the user wrote \"starting at one day before,\" which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps they want the date_of_journey to be May 14, but that's unclear. \n\nAssuming the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is a specific time on that day. Since the user mentioned \"starting at one day before,\" maybe they meant the start time is 1 day before the actual date, but that's not possible. So perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant the start time is on May 15. Let's proceed with the given date.\n\nNumber of adults is 4. Trip protection is required. The class is Business. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\n_from: Portland, OR\nto: Seattle, WA\ndate_of_journey: 2023-05-15\njourney_start_time: Need to figure out. The user says \"starting at one day before,\" but that's unclear. Maybe they meant the start time is 12:00 AM (midnight) of the previous day? But that would be May 14. However, the date_of_journey is May 15. This is conflicting. Maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. Since the user didn't specify the exact time, perhaps we can use a default or leave it as a placeholder. But the function requires journey_start_time. \n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in the phrasing. If the journey is on May 15, starting one day before, that would be May 14. But that's not logical. Alternatively, maybe the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is 1 day before the actual date? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the user meant the start time is 1 day before the end of the journey? Not sure. Since the user didn't provide a specific time, maybe we need to ask for clarification, but since this is a function call, we have to proceed with the given info. \n\nAssuming the user intended the journey to start on May 15, 2023, and the start time is, say, 8:00 AM. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the journey_start_time is missing. However, the function requires it. Therefore, the user's request is missing the journey_start_time parameter. But the user might have intended to provide it as \"one day before,\" which is ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the date_of_journey is May 14, and the start time is on that day. But the original question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before.\" That's conflicting. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to use the date_of_journey as May 15, and set the journey_start_time to a default, but the function requires it. Since the user didn't provide it, the function call can't be made. However, the user might have made a mistake in the start time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is 12:00 AM (midnight). So journey_start_time would be '00:00'. \n\nGiven that, the parameters would be:\n\n_from: Portland, OR\nto: Seattle, WA\ndate_of_journey: 2023-05-15\njourney_start_time: 00:00 (assuming midnight)\nnumber_of_adults: 4\ntrip_protection: True\n_class: Business\n\nSo the function call would be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with these parameters. However, the date_of_journey in the function's required parameters is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, which matches the user's input. The journey_start_time is in 'HH:MM' 24-hour format. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with the specified parameters."}

However, without knowing the total number of pages, it's tricky. But the default page_size is 20, so maybe start with that and if there's a next page, the user might need to call again. But the user is urgent, so maybe just get the first page for now.\n\nWait, the user's user ID is 12345. The first function (get_shareable_api_tokens) requires user_id, so that's necessary. The second function (get_api_tokens) doesn't require user_id, but maybe it's for the current user?
