The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination is optional, but since the next steps refer to the repo directory, maybe I should clone it to a specific directory. Wait, the default is the current directory, so maybe just use that. So call clone_repo with repo_url as the provided URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory_name would be the repo's root. Let's say the directory is 'nodejs-welcome' but the user didn't specify, so maybe the default is '.'? Wait, the clone_repo's destination default is '.', so the repo is cloned into the current directory. So the directory_name for analysis would be '.'? Or maybe the actual repo name? Hmm, the user didn't specify the directory name, but the repo URL is nodejs-welcome.git, so the directory would be nodejs-welcome. But if the clone was done with default destination, it would create that directory. Wait, no. If you clone a repo, the default destination is the current directory, so the repo is cloned into a directory named after the repo. For example, cloning into '.' would put it in the current directory, but typically, if you don't specify, git creates a directory named after the repo. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination parameter has a default of '.', which means the current directory. So the repo would be cloned into the current directory. But the actual directory structure might have the repo in a subdirectory. Wait, maybe the user expects that after cloning, the repo is in a directory named nodejs-welcome. But according to the function's default, if destination is '.', then the repo is cloned into the current directory. So perhaps the directory_name for analysis is 'nodejs-welcome'? Or maybe the function's analyse_repo_contents takes the directory where the repo is located. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But the user's step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo\", so the directory_name should be the root of the cloned repo. Assuming that the clone was done into the current directory as a subdirectory named nodejs-welcome, then the directory_name would be 'nodejs-welcome'. So first, clone the repo, then analyze it in that directory.\n\nOnce analyzed, create/update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. So after analysis, we need to create the Dockerfile in the same directory. Then create Kubernetes YAMLs using create_kubernetes_yaml_file, again with the same directory_name.\n\nAfter modifying files, push the changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs the directory_name, commit message, etc. The user says to add all changed files, so the function should handle that.\n\nSo the steps in functions would be:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with repo_url=git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, destination (maybe default '.'), but perhaps the directory is nodejs-welcome. Wait, the clone_repo function's destination is where to clone. If the user didn't specify, the default is '.', so the repo is cloned into the current directory. But the actual directory name would be nodejs-welcome. So the destination is '.', and the repo is cloned into a subdirectory named nodejs-welcome. Therefore, the directory_name for analysis is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo first, clone the repo. Then analyze it. Then create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs in that directory. Then push the changes.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url=git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name=nodejs-welcome\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name=nodejs-welcome\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name=nodejs-welcome (and maybe other parameters if needed, but defaults are used)\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name=nodejs-welcome, commit_message=\"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\", branch_name=main (assuming default)\n\nWait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", but the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So the push function handles adding, committing, and pushing. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, the push function is called.\n\nBut the user's step 4 says \"commit / push to repo\", so the push_git_changes_to_github function is needed. The commit message can be specified, but the default is \"Update changes\". However, the user might want a specific message. Since the user didn't specify, maybe use the default. But the user's step 3 says to add all changed files, which the push function does automatically. So the order is: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push.\n\nSo the functions to call in order are:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nNow, checking parameters for each function.\n\nclone_repo: repo_url is required. The user provided git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So that's set. The other parameters (destination, recursive, depth) are optional. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. So destination is '.'.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents: directory_name is required. The directory is where the repo is cloned. Assuming it's in 'nodejs-welcome' directory (since the repo name is nodejs-welcome.git), so directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_a_docker_file: directory_name is required. Same as above, 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name is required. Again, 'nodejs-welcome'. The other parameters have defaults. The user didn't specify deployment_name, image_name, etc., so use defaults.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github: directory_name is required. 'nodejs-welcome'. The commit_message can be set to something like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\", but the default is \"Update changes\". The user didn't specify, so maybe use the default. Branch is main by default. So the parameters would be directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main'.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"clone_repo\"><params><param name=\"repo_url\" value=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" type=\"string\"/></params></function>\n<function name=\"analyse_repo_contents\"><params><param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/></params></function>\n<function name=\"create_a_docker_file\"><params><param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/></params></function>\n<function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\"><params><param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/></params></function>\n<function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\"><params><param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/></params></function>\n</functions>\n\nWait, but the create_kubernetes_yaml_file has parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so the defaults are used. The function's parameters have defaults, so no need to include them unless specified. So the function call is correct as is.\n\nBut the user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis.\" Does the create_a_docker_file function use the analysis result? The functions are separate; the analysis is done first, then the Dockerfile is created. The create_a_docker_file function doesn't take parameters based on the analysis, so maybe the analysis is just to determine the language, but the Dockerfile creation is generic. The user's instruction is to create/update the Dockerfile based on the analysis, but the function doesn't take any parameters from the analysis. So perhaps the analysis is just to inform the Dockerfile creation, but the function is called regardless. So the steps are followed as per the functions provided.\n\nTherefore, the function calls are as above."}

The user is asking two things: the area of a square with a 5 cm side and the weather in Queenstown, Singapore.\n\nFirst, for the area of the square. The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned 5 cm. The function expects a float, so I'll use 5.0 as the value. The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention handling units, so I just pass the numerical value. That should calculate 5 squared, which is 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a 'location' parameter. Queenstown is a place in Singapore, so the location should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function allows formats like \"City, Country\", so this fits. The unit parameter is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit, but since the user didn't specify, I'll omit it or use the default. However, in Singapore, Celsius is more commonly used, but the function's default is Fahrenheit. Hmm, maybe the user expects Celsius. Wait, the function's default is Fahrenheit, but the user might prefer Celsius. However, since the user didn't specify, I should stick with the default unless instructed otherwise. But the function allows specifying the unit. Should I include it? The user didn't mention the unit, so maybe it's safer to not include it and let the function use the default. Alternatively, maybe include Celsius as a parameter. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps it's better to just provide the location and let the default handle it. So, the parameters for the weather function would be location: \"Queenstown, Singapore\" and unit: default (fahrenheit). Wait, but Singapore uses Celsius. Maybe the user expects Celsius. However, the function's default is Fahrenheit. Should I override it? The user didn't specify, so maybe I shouldn't assume. But the function allows specifying the unit. Since the user didn't mention it, perhaps it's best to leave it out. Alternatively, maybe include it as Celsius. Hmm. The user might not be aware of the default. Since the function's default is Fahrenheit, but in Singapore, Celsius is standard, maybe the user expects Celsius. But without explicit instruction, I should follow the function's default unless told otherwise. So, I'll proceed with just the location parameter.\n\nSo, two function calls: one for the area with size 5.0, and another for the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Check if all required parameters are present. For get_area_of_square, 'size' is required, which is provided. For get_current_weather, 'location' is required, which is provided.

The user wants two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon on 2023-05-10 at 15:00.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider for finding providers. The parameters needed are city and is_unisex (optional). The city should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so Sunnyvale, CA fits. The is_unisex can default to 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is required. It needs stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided all three: 'Elegant Styles', '15:00', and '2023-05-10'. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The date is already in 'YYYY-MM-DD' and time in 'HH:MM'. The stylist name is given as a string. \n\nSo, two function calls are needed here: first to find the stylist and then to book the appointment. The parameters for each are all provided by the user. No missing parameters here. The Weather function isn't needed here since the user didn't ask for weather info."}
