First, they want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. Looking at the available functions, there's ChaFod for modifying food items. The parameters required are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the foodItem. They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they didn't specify any, maybe it's not needed. So the first function call is ChaFod with foodItem \"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients \"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", and milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions aren't mentioned, so that can be omitted. So the second function call is ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id \"123\" and new_preferences containing those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory name. This will determine the predominant language, which is probably Node.js given the repo name.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using the current directory. But wait, the repo might have a specific directory structure. However, the user didn't specify a subdirectory, so assuming the root.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name. Same as above. The parameters for Kubernetes include deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. The image name might be based on the repo name, but the default is 'latest', so maybe that's okay. Replicas default to 1, port 80, service type ClusterIP.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, commit_message, branch_name. The user didn't specify a message, so use the default 'Update changes'. Branch is 'main' by default. Force push is False unless needed.\n\nWait, step 3 says add all changed files to Git. But the push function automatically adds changes. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we need to run git add ., but the push function does that. So after creating the files, call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, and branch.\n\nSo the functions in order are: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github. \n\nCheck if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse, directory_name is '.' (current dir). For Dockerfile, directory_name is same. For Kubernetes, same directory. Push requires directory_name, which is same. So all parameters are there. No missing info. So the function calls should be in that order."}

The function get_relevant_classes is suitable here. The parameters required are search_string, which should be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories set to true as per the user's request. So I'll call get_relevant_classes with those parameters.\n\nNext, the user wants the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. I need to call this function twice: once for each method. For each call, the parameters are class_name 'AbstractCellHandler' and method_name as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. The include_private parameter is optional and defaults to false, which is fine here unless the methods are private, but the user mentioned overriding, so they're likely public.\n\nWait, the user is extending 'AbstractCellHandler' and overriding methods. So the methods in the parent class should be present. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', which might be a method that's supposed to be overridden or used. But the user's main request is about the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1.

I remember there's a function called get_area_of_square that takes a size parameter. The required parameter is 'size', which should be a float. The user provided 5 cm, so the size is 5.0. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned \"Queenstown Singapore\", but I should check if that's a valid location. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user might be referring to Queenstown in Singapore? Or maybe it's a typo. However, I should take the input as given. The location parameter can be in the format \"City, Country\". So \"Queenstown, Singapore\" would fit. But wait, Singapore is a country, but sometimes it's referred to as a city-state. However, the function's examples include \"San Francisco, CA\" and \"Paris, France\", so using \"Queenstown, Singapore\" should be acceptable. The unit is optional, defaulting to fahrenheit. The user didn't specify, so we can use the default.\n\nSo I need to call both functions.
