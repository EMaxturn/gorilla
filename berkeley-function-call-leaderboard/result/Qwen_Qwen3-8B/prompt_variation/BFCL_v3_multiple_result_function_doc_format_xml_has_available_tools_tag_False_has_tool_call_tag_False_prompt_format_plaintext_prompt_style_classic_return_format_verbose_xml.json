The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, defaults to US). Since the user specified the US, maybe the region parameter isn't needed, but including it would be safe.\n\nWait, the question is about the cheapest price. But the store_price function might return the current price, not necessarily the cheapest ever. However, given the available functions, there's no function that specifically gets the cheapest price ever. The user might be assuming that the current price is the cheapest, or maybe they want the lowest price available now. Since the functions provided don't have a way to compare historical prices, I should proceed with the store_price function to get the current price. \n\nAlternatively, if the game is on sale, the on_sale function could check that. But the user is asking for the selling price, not whether it's on sale. So the store_price is the right choice. \n\nSo, I need to call video_games.store_price with game_title \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\", platform \"PlayStation\", and region \"United States\". That should give the current selling price, which might be the cheapest available now. There's no other function to get the cheapest price, so this is the best option."}

The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters: it requires distance (integer) and time (integer), which the user provided (20 meters and 4 seconds). The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, which matches the scenario. So I should use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed. I don't need the acceleration function here because the question isn't asking for acceleration, just the final speed. Let me make sure I'm not missing any parameters.

The formula used by the function would likely be displacement = initial_velocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time^2, but I don't need to worry about that.

So the parameters would be location: \"New York, NY\", art_form: \"sculpture\", and user_ratings: \"high\". \n\nWait, the location parameter's example is \"New York, NY\", so I should format it that way. The art_form is \"modern sculpture\"? Wait, the function's art_form param says \"form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" So maybe just \"sculpture\" is enough.
