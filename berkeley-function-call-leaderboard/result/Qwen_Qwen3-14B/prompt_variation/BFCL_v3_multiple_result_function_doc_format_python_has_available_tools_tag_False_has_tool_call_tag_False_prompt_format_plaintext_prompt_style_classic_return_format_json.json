The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight line motion, so the kinematics functions should apply.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2 decimals.\n\nI need to make sure the function call includes those values. So the parameters would be initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. Since rounding isn't mentioned, I don't include it. The function should compute the displacement using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. \n\nI think that's all. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct call is to calculate_displacement with the given parameters."}

The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. The region has a default, but the user specified it, so I should include that. \n\nI need to call store_price with these parameters. There's no mention of checking sales, but the on_sale function could indicate if it's on sale, which might affect the price. However, the user specifically asks for the selling price, so store_price is the primary function needed. \n\nWait, the user wants the cheapest price. If the game is on sale, the store_price might already reflect the discounted price. But maybe the on_sale function is separate. However, the store_price function's description says it fetches the selling price, which could be the current price considering any sales. So perhaps just calling store_price is sufficient. \n\nI should proceed by calling store_price with the given parameters. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's on sale or the regular price otherwise. The user didn't mention needing comparison across regions, just the US.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. Wait, the calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed when starting from rest with constant acceleration over a distance. But the parameters it takes are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). Wait, but the function's name is calculate_speed_from_rest, which might imply it's calculating the final speed. But the parameters include time and distance. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe calculate_speed_from_rest function has args: distance (int), time (int), initial_speed (default 0). But how does that work? Normally, if you have distance, time, and initial speed, you can calculate average speed, but to find final speed under constant acceleration, maybe it's using the formula that relates distance, time, initial velocity, and acceleration. Wait, the standard equation is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Since initial velocity u is 0 (starting from rest), then s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Then acceleration a = 2s/t\u00b2. Once you have acceleration, final velocity v = u + a*t = a*t. So combining these, v = (2s/t\u00b2) * t = 2s/t. So the final speed would be 2*distance / time. \n\nBut the function calculate_speed_from_rest might be doing that. Let me check the parameters. The function requires distance and time, which are given here (20 meters and 4 seconds). So if I call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0 (though initial_speed is default 0), then maybe it returns the final speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is named incorrectly, but given the parameters, that's the only function available. The other function is calculate_acceleration, which requires initial and final speed and time, but we don't have final speed here. So the correct approach is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is 0 by default, so maybe that's redundant but okay. \n\nSo the function call should be to calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's the default, maybe we don't need to specify it. But the parameters for the function require distance and time as integers. The user provided 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. So the parameters are valid. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4."}
