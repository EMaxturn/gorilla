However, it says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" But that might apply only when invoking functions.\n\nRe-reading: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params)...]. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nFor not invoking, I need to point it out, so perhaps I can say something like \"No function can be used because...\" but the prompt doesn't specify.\n\nThe initial instruction: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nI think I need to respond with a message indicating that.\n\nTo be safe, I should follow the format as closely as possible. Perhaps just state the issue.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and then specifies the format.\n\nFor this case, since I can't call a function, I might need to output something like a message.\n\nPerhaps I can output nothing, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother part: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI need to indicate that no functions can be called.\n\nThe best is to not output any function call and perhaps use a specific format, but since it's not specified, I'll assume I can output a plain text response pointing it out.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and earlier, \"You are to put your response in [format].\"\n\nTo be precise, I should say something like: \"The question lacks the required parameters: independent_var data is not provided.\"\n\nI have to make sure it's in the response.\n\nPerhaps the system expects me to only output the function calls, and if not, output nothing, but that contradicts \"point it out.\"\n\nLet's think differently. In the initial system prompt, it says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text.\"\n\nImplied is that if I don't invoke, I can include other text to point it out.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\nMy response should be: Point out that the independent_var is missing.\n\nFor the functions, if I were to call one, I could use, say, linear_regression with independent_var as ['interest rates', 'unemployment rates'], but that's not an array of values; it's an array of strings, which is probably not correct. The function expects an array of numerical values, I assume.\n\nThe description says: \"independent_var (array): The independent variables.\" Likely numerical data.\n\nSince it's not provided, I can't proceed.\n\nFinal decision: No function call can be made because required parameters are missing."}

If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nSo, for this, I should point out that none of the functions can be used because they are for vegan products, not for vegetarian and gluten-free.\n\nThe location is given as \"near Denver\", which I can map to \"Denver, CO\" as in the examples.\n\nBut the main issue is the type of products.\n\nPerhaps I can call walmart_vegan_products and pass categories that might include gluten-free, but that's not specified.\n\nThis might not fulfill the request accurately.\n\nI think the safe thing is to point out that the functions don't support vegetarian and gluten-free specifically.\n\nSo, my response should be something like: None of the available functions support querying for vegetarian and gluten-free products; they only support vegan products.\n\nI need to follow the format. The prompt doesn't specify exactly how to point it out, but it says \"point it out\", and then \"You should only return the function calls in your response\", which implies that if I'm not returning function calls, I can return text.\n\nTo be precise, perhaps I should just not return any function calls and use text.\n\nIn the system prompt, it says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete...\"\n\nFor this, I should respond with text indicating the issue.\n\nFinal decision: Since no function matches, I'll respond with a message pointing it out."}

The function description says \"The number of times that interest is compounded per unit period.\" In the function, it's a string, but the description might imply it should be something like \"monthly\". Let me check the function doc:\n\n  - compounding_freq (string): The number of times that interest is compounded per unit period.\n\n  This is a bit unclear. Typically, for compound interest, compounding frequency is like \"monthly\", which means 12 times a year. But the doc says \"The number of times\", yet it's defined as a string. In the function signature, it's (string), so I need to provide a string like \"monthly\". But the doc says \"The number of times\", which might be a mismatch. Looking closely: \"compounding_freq (string): The number of times that interest is compounded per unit period.\"\n\n  This is ambiguous. In standard compound interest formulas, it's the number of times per year, like 12 for monthly. But it's specified as a string. Perhaps I should use \"12\" as a string, or \"monthly\". The function doesn't specify examples. To be safe, I'll assume it's expecting a string like \"monthly\", but that might not be correct. Re-reading: \"The number of times that interest is compounded per unit period.\" So, probably it wants a string representation of the number, like \"12\" for monthly.\n\n  In the function definition: compounding_freq (string), and the description says \"The number of times\", so likely it expects a string like \"12\".\n\n  For monthly compounding, it's 12 times per year. So, I should pass \"12\".\n\n  In finance, \"monthly\" means 12 times a year, so passing \"12\" makes sense.\n\n- time_in_years: 5 (integer)\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- principal=10000\n\n- annual_rate=5.0 (as a float)\n\n- compounding_freq=\"12\" (since monthly means 12 times per year)\n\n- time_in_years=5\n\nThe response format is strict: I must only return the function calls in the format [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\n\nSo, I should output: [compound_interest(principal=10000, annual_rate=5.0, compounding_freq=\"12\", time_in_years=5)]\n\nAfter this function call, the system will execute it and provide the result, so I don't need to call anything else.\n\nThis fulfills the user's request in one turn."}

However, the user said \"5% annual yield\", so I need to convert it to 0.05.\n\nLooking back: in the function call, I have to provide it as is. The doc doesn't specify, but in the example, it's just \"float\", so I'll use 5.0 if it's 5%.\n\nTo be precise, in financial calculations, annual yield is often input as a decimal. But the user said \"5%\", so I should pass it as 0.05.\n\nThe function is: calculate_mutual_fund_balance(investment_amount, annual_yield, years)\n\nAnd in the doc: \"annual_yield (float): The annual yield rate of the fund.\"\n\nI think it's standard to pass it as 0.05 for 5%. I'll go with that.\n\n- years: The user said \"after 3 years\", so 3.\n\nSo, parameters:\n\n- investment_amount: 50000 (integer)\n\n- annual_yield: 5% means 0.05 (float)\n\n- years: 3 (integer)\n\nI can make a function call to calculate_mutual_fund_balance with these values.\n\nThe response format must be exactly: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [calculate_mutual_fund_balance(investment_amount=50000, annual_yield=0.05, years=3)]\n\nIs annual_yield 0.05 or 5? I need to confirm. In the function doc, it says \"annual yield rate\", and for compound interest, it's usually the decimal form. For example, in formulas like A = P(1 + r)^t, r is 0.05.\n\nI think 0.05 is correct.\n\nAfter this function call, I believe that's all that's needed, as it directly answers the user's question.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIt also says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But it doesn't specify how to point it out. However, it says to only return function calls or point it out, but in the context, I think I need to not make the call if parameters are missing.\n\nRe-reading: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose. If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nAnd \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis is a bit conflicting. But it says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nSo, if I can't invoke it due to missing parameters, I shouldn't return a function call; instead, I should point it out.\n\nHow do I point it out? The instructions don't specify the format for that. It just says \"point it out\" and \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to not return anything in that format and just indicate in text, but the instructions say: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" This is tricky.\n\nLooking back: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But earlier: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nI think the implication is that if I can't make a function call, I should respond with text explaining why, but the instructions strictly say not to include other text.\n\nIn the system prompt: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nFor cases where I can't, it might be implied to not respond with that format.\n\nTo be precise, I should check if I can make the call. The language is missing, so I can't fully specify the function call.\n\nThe text is in English, so I could assume it's 'en' or something, but the instructions don't say I can assume; I have to use what's given.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nI need to point it out, which means not making the call and perhaps responding with text.\n\nBut to follow strictly: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" So, if I can't, maybe return nothing or a message.\n\nThis is ambiguous, but in practice, I think I should not make the call and indicate the issue.\n\nPerhaps I can make the call with what I have and let the function handle it, but the function requires language.\n\nAnother thought: the function description doesn't say language is optional; it's a required parameter.\n\nIn the function def: def sentiment_analysis(text, language): so both are required.\n\nSince language is missing, I should point it out.\n\nHow? Maybe in the response, say something like \"Missing parameter: language\".\n\nThe instructions say: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" except for the function calls.\n\nPerhaps the system expects me to only output the function call if it's complete.\n\nTo resolve this, I'll assume that if I can't make a complete call, I don't output anything in that format, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLooking at the end: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI need to output a response indicating the issue.\n\nPerhaps I can output a function call only if it's possible.\n\nFor this, since language is missing, I can't call it.\n\nSo, my response should be to point it out, say: \"The question lacks the required parameter 'language' for the sentiment_analysis function.\"\n\nBut that violates \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text.\"\n\nThis is a problem. Maybe the instruction means that when you do call functions, only include the call, but if not, include text.\n\nTo be safe, I'll check if there's a way.\n\nPerhaps I can call it with a default, but no.\n\nAnother idea: the text is in English, and it's common to assume, but the instructions don't allow assumption.\n\nI think the best is to not make the call and point it out in text.\n\nSo, I'll respond with: The given question lacks the required parameter 'language' for the sentiment_analysis function.\n\nYes.\n\nFinal decision: Since the parameter is missing, I'll point it out in the response."}

But since it's default, I might not need to include it.\n\nIn the function call format, I should only include the required parameters.

The user asked for \"names of proteins\", so I might not need descriptions, but the function can include it if specified.\n\nThe user specifically wants \"names\", so I can set include_description to False or omit it since it's optional.\n\nI need to respond with only the function call in the specified format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this, I should call: cellbio_get_proteins(cell_compartment='plasma membrane', include_description=False)\n\nIs \"plasma membrane\" the correct term?
