The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem statement since it starts from rest.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're the same gas, the formula simplifies to (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2). Wait, is that right? Let me think. For ideal gases, the internal energy depends on temperature and moles. So when mixing, the total internal energy is the sum of each part. So U_total = n1*C*T1 + n2*C*T2. Then the final temperature T_final would be U_total / (n1 + n2) * 1/C. Since C is the same for both, it cancels out. So yes, T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2).\n\nSo the parameters here are quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. The function calculate_final_temperature requires all four parameters. The user provided all of them, so I can call that function. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed here because the question is about temperature, not mass. So the correct tool call is to calculate_final_temperature with those values."}
