The function needed here is kinematics.calculate_displacement.\n\nFirst, I check the parameters required for that function: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20, 10, and 5. The rounding is optional, and since it's not mentioned, I can omit it or set to default. The function should handle the calculation using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Plugging in the values: 20*5 + 0.5*10*25 = 100 + 125 = 225 meters. So the function call should include those parameters. No missing info, so proceed."}

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price in the US, I need to call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. The on_sale function checks if it's on sale, but the question is about the cheapest price, which might involve checking if it's on sale and then the price. However, the user specifically mentions the selling price, so maybe store_price is sufficient. But wait, if the game is on sale, the store_price might return the discounted price. So I should call store_price with the given parameters. The region is specified as United States, so I'll include that. The parameters are game_title, platform, and region. So the function call would be video_games.store_price with game_title=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\", platform=\"PlayStation\", region=\"United States\"."}

Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question says the object started from rest, so initial speed is 0. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance (integer) and time (integer), which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional but since it's from rest, it's 0. But the function's parameters list initial_speed as optional, so maybe it's not needed. But the function's description says it's for objects starting from rest, so maybe the initial_speed is implicitly zero. \n\nSo I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed isn't needed here because it's already from rest. The function should compute the speed based on those parameters. Let me make sure there's no other function that's more appropriate. The other function is for calculating acceleration, but the user is asking for speed, so calculate_speed_from_rest is the right choice."}

Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of thermal energy. The formula is (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2), where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters.

Wait, the parameter expects a string, like \"June\" or \"July,\" but the description says the default returns upcoming events. So maybe leaving it out is okay. But the user is asking for the upcoming month, so perhaps including month as \"upcoming\" is better. Wait, the function's month parameter is a string, but the example in the description says \"month of exhibition.
