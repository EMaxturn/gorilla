However, note that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the selling price for a specific game on a platform in a region. Since the user specifies the platform (PlayStation) and region (United States), we can use that function.\n\n But note: the question says \"cheapest selling price\". This might imply that there could be multiple prices (e.g., standard edition, deluxe edition) but the function `video_games.store_price` does not specify an edition. We must assume that the function returns the price for the base game or the only available version? However, the function does not have a parameter for edition. \n\n Since the function does not support specifying an edition, we will call it with the given game title. It's possible that the store might have multiple editions and the function might return the base edition price or an array of prices? But looking at the function definition, it returns a price (likely a float). \n\n Alternatively, the function might return the price for the most common edition? We don't have a function that returns all editions. Therefore, we will call the function as described.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are to get the price for 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on PlayStation in the United States.\n\n However, note that the question asks for the \"cheapest\" price. If there are multiple editions, we might need to get all editions? But we don't have a function for that. So we have to rely on the `video_games.store_price` function to return the base price.\n\n Since we cannot get multiple editions, we will assume that the function returns the base game price.\n\n Alternatively, it's possible that the store has a single listing for the game and the function returns that. So we call:\n\n  video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a parameter `region` that is not required and defaults to United States. So we can omit region? However, to be explicit, we can set it to 'United States'.\n\n However, the question asks for the cheapest selling price. If the game is on sale, the sale price might be lower. But note that the `video_games.store_price` function should return the current selling price, which if on sale would be the sale price. So we don't need to check the sale status separately.\n\n Therefore, we can directly call `video_games.store_price`.\n\n But wait: the function `video_games.on_sale` is also available. However, we don't need to check it because the store_price should reflect the current price (whether on sale or not). So we don't need to call `video_games.on_sale`.\n\n However, the question says \"cheapest\". Is there a possibility of multiple stores? The user specifies \"PlayStation Store\". So we are only looking at one store.\n\n Therefore, we will call the function `video_games.store_price` with the given parameters.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` is also available. The question does not ask for currency, but we might want to return the currency as well? The question only asks for the price. However, the function `store_price` does not specify the currency. We might need to get the currency separately? \n\n However, the question says \"selling price\" and doesn't specify the currency. Since the region is United States, the currency would be USD. But to be safe, we might also want to get the currency? The user might expect the currency to be included? But the question does not explicitly ask for the currency.\n\n Since the question is about the price in the United States, it's implied that the currency is USD. But if we want to be thorough, we can also get the currency by calling `video_games.store_currency` for the PlayStation platform in the United States.\n\n However, the user only asked for the price. We can return the price and the currency together? But the function `store_price` only returns the price. We don't have a function that returns both.\n\n Alternatively, we can make two calls: one for the price and one for the currency? But the user didn't ask for the currency. So we might skip it? Or we can get it to be complete.\n\n But note: the instruction says to only output the function calls that are necessary to achieve the purpose. The purpose is to get the cheapest selling price. Since the user didn't ask for the currency, and the region is specified, we can assume the currency is USD. However, the problem does not state that we know the currency for a region. We have a function to get the currency.\n\n Considering the requirement: if the given question lacks parameters required by the function, point it out. But we have all parameters for `store_price`.\n\n Since the user did not ask for the currency, we can just return the price. However, if we are to display the result, we might need the currency. But the instruction only says to call the function. The system that processes the function call will then return the result, and then we can see the next step.\n\n But note: the system will consider the current turn complete when we have no more functions to call. We are to output the function calls until we have fulfilled the user's request.\n\n However, the user's request is: \"What is the cheapest selling price ...\". We are getting the price. But we are not getting the currency. How will we present the price? Without currency, it might be ambiguous.\n\n Therefore, to fully answer the question, we should also get the currency. So we will make two function calls:\n\n 1. Get the price: video_games.store_price\n 2. Get the currency: video_games.store_currency\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` requires the platform and optionally the region. We are in the United States.\n\n Alternatively, we can assume that the currency for the United States is USD? But the function exists to get the currency for a region. So we should use it to be safe.\n\n Therefore, we will call:\n\n  1. video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n  2. video_games.store_currency(platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n However, note that the region parameter in `store_currency` is not required. But we want the currency for the United States, so we set it.\n\n But wait: the function `store_price` returns the price in the currency of the region. So if we get the price and then the currency, we can combine them to present the price with the currency symbol or code.\n\n However, the user asked for the cheapest selling price. We are getting the price and the currency. We can then report: \"The cheapest price is [price] [currency]\".\n\n Therefore, we will make two function calls.\n\n Alternatively, we could have designed a function that returns both, but we don't have that. So we have to make two calls.\n\n But note: the instruction says to output the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. We can output multiple function calls in one TOOLCALL block.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n So we output:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"game_title\" value=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"platform\" value=\"PlayStation\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"region\" value=\"United States\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"video_games.store_currency\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"platform\" value=\"PlayStation\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"region\" value=\"United States\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function `store_currency` does not require the region? Actually, the function has `region` as required=false. But if we don't specify region, it might return the default? However, we want the United States. So we specify.\n\n Alternatively, if we don't specify the region in `store_currency`, it might use a default? The description says: \"The region e.g. United States, United Kingdom, Japan\". It doesn't specify a default. But the function `store_price` has a default region of United States. For consistency, we set the region for both.\n\n However, the `store_currency` function does not specify a default. So to be safe, we set it.\n\n But note: the function `store_currency` has `region` as not required. So we can omit it? But without region, it might not know which region? We don't know the behavior. Since we have the region, we set it.\n\n Therefore, we set both.\n\n Alternatively, if the function `store_currency` without region returns the currency for the platform's default region, and if the default region is United States, then we can omit. But to be explicit, we set region.\n\n We'll set region for both.\n\n Let me re-read the function definitions:\n\n - `video_games.store_currency`: region is required=false. The description doesn't say default. But the function `store_price` says for region: \"Default to United States\". We don't have that for `store_currency`. So we must set it to ensure we get the United States currency.\n\n Therefore, we set region for both.\n\n So the final function calls are as above."}

Also, the function parameters list initial_speed as optional. However, the function name suggests it is for starting from rest, so we might not need to specify initial_speed? But let's look: the function has a parameter for initial_speed that is optional. Since we know it's 0, we can provide it.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest might be designed to assume rest if initial_speed is not provided? But the function description says \"starts from rest\", so it might be built to use 0 if not provided. However, the problem says \"started from rest\", so we can set initial_speed=0.\n\n But wait: the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest expects the parameters as integers. Our values are 20 and 4, which are integers, and 0 is also an integer.\n\n However, there is also the function kinematics.calculate_acceleration that might be used? But the question asks for the speed (which I assume is the final speed).

We can omit it? But the problem says it started from rest, so the function might be designed to work without it. However, to be safe and explicit, we can include it.\n\n However, the function's description says: \"Calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest\", so it might assume initial_speed=0 even if not provided. But since we know it, we can provide.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the acceleration function and then compute the speed? But the question asks for the speed (final speed) and we have initial_speed=0, time, and distance.\n\n Actually, we can use either:\n\n Option 1: Use kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance and time (and optionally initial_speed=0).\n\n Option 2: We can calculate acceleration first and then use the kinematic equation to get final speed.\n\n But note: we have a function that directly calculates the speed from rest given distance and time? Actually, the kinematic equation for distance from rest is: d = (v_i)*t + (1/2)*a*t^2. Since v_i=0, then d = (1/2)*a*t^2, so a = 2d/t^2. Then final speed v_f = v_i + a*t = 0 + (2d/t^2)*t = 2d/t. So the final speed is 2d/t.\n\n Alternatively, the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest might be using that formula? Or it might be using the formula: v_f = sqrt(2*a*d)? But without acceleration given, that formula wouldn't be used. Actually, we have two equations: \n   d = (v_i + v_f)/2 * t   [because constant acceleration] \n Since v_i=0, then d = (v_f/2)*t => v_f = 2d/t.\n\n So the function calculate_speed_from_rest is likely using that.\n\n Therefore, we can call:\n   kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0)\n\n However, note the function expects integers. We have integers.\n\n But wait: the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest has a parameter \"initial_speed\" that is optional. Since we are providing it, that's fine.\n\n Alternatively, we can also use kinematics.calculate_acceleration to get the acceleration and then compute the final speed? But that would require two steps and we have a direct function.\n\n Since we have a direct function, we use that.\n\n Let's call the function with the parameters."}

We'll use `art_form=\"sculpture\"` and rely on the backend to incorporate \"modern\" via context or descriptions. \n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"art_form\" value=\"sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"user_ratings\" value=\"top\" type=\"string\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 849, "output_token_count": 1841, "latency": 99.10335659980774, "reasoning_content": "We are given: \n   - location: New York\n   - art_form: sculpture (but note the question specifies \"modern sculpture\")\n   - month: upcoming month (so we can leave out the month parameter to use the default of upcoming events)\n   - user_ratings: top rated -> we can set user_ratings to a high threshold, but the function expects a string and default is 'high'. Since we want top rated, we can set it to 'high' or perhaps even higher? The function doesn't specify exact values, but we know default is 'high'. Since the question says \"top rated\", we can set it to the highest possible. However, the function doesn't specify what string values are allowed. Let's assume that we can set it to 'very high' or 'top'? But the function description says default is 'high'. Since we don't know the exact allowed values, and the function says \"threshold\", we can try setting it to a high value. Alternatively, note that the function does not require this parameter and by default it uses 'high'. Since we want top rated, and the default is already set to high, we might not need to set it. However, to be safe and explicit, we can set it to 'high' (which is the default) or perhaps the function allows a value like 'top'. But without knowing, we'll stick to the provided description.\n\nHowever, note that the function `find_exhibition` requires:\n   - location: string (required) -> we have \"New York, NY\" (but note the example says \"New York, NY\", so we can use that format)\n   - art_form: string (required) -> we have \"sculpture\", but the question says \"modern sculpture\". We might need to adjust the art_form to include the modern aspect? The function doesn't have a parameter for style or era. So we have to rely on the art_form only. Since the function doesn't specify that it can filter by style, we have to use \"sculpture\". Maybe the function's backend can handle \"modern sculpture\" as a string? We don't know. Alternatively, we can try to be more specific by including the word \"modern\". But the parameter is called \"art_form\", and \"sculpture\" is the form. So we can set art_form to \"sculpture\" and hope that the backend considers the description? \n\nAlternatively, note that the function description says: \"Locate the most popular exhibitions based on criteria like location, time, art form, and user ratings.\" It doesn't mention style. So we cannot filter by modern style in this function. Therefore, we might have to get the list and then filter? But we are limited to the functions provided.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we can use the `get_sculpture_info` function to get information about modern sculptures? But that function is for a specific artist, and we don't have an artist name. Also, it doesn't return exhibitions.\n\nSo, we are constrained to `find_exhibition` for this task. We'll set:\n   - location: \"New York, NY\"\n   - art_form: \"sculpture\" (we cannot specify modern, so we have to hope that the backend returns exhibitions that are modern or we can try to include the word \"modern\" in the art_form? Let's try: art_form=\"modern sculpture\". But the function doesn't specify if it can handle multiple words. We'll try that.)\n\nAlso, note that we are asked for the \"upcoming month\", so we don't specify the month (which will default to upcoming events).\n\nFor user_ratings, we want top rated. We can set it to \"top\" or \"very high\", but without knowing the exact values, we can set it to \"high\" (the default) and hope that the backend returns the top ones. Alternatively, the function might not require it and by default returns popular ones? Since the function says \"most popular\", and we are setting user_ratings to high, that should be okay.\n\nBut note: the question says \"top rated\", so we can set user_ratings to the highest possible. Since the function doesn't specify, we'll set it to \"high\" (which is the default) and hope that it returns the top ones. Alternatively, we can leave it out and let the function use the default.\n\nGiven the above, we'll call:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\nBut note: the function does not have a parameter for style, so including \"modern\" might not be supported. We have to decide: without the modern, we get all sculpture exhibitions. Then we might have to filter for modern? But we cannot do that with the functions. So we have to rely on the art_form string to include the style.\n\nAlternatively, we can call without the modern and then in the next step if we get the results we can filter? But we are only allowed to call functions and we don't have a function to process the results.\n\nSo, we'll try to put \"modern sculpture\" in the art_form and hope the function can handle it.\n\nAlternatively, we can call with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then hope that the exhibition titles or descriptions include the word \"modern\"? But we cannot do that with the current functions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best is to use art_form=\"sculpture\" and then in the user_ratings we set to high and hope that the top ones are modern? But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the function doesn't support modern, so we have to get all sculpture exhibitions and then later (if we had more functions) we could filter. But we don't. So we have to do with what we have.\n\nBut the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" However, we are not pointing it out in the function call format? We are only to output function calls. But the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But note: the output format is strictly the function call in the <TOOLCALL> section. So we cannot output text.\n\nTherefore, we have to make the best call we can. We'll set:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"\n   user_ratings: \"high\"\n\nand omit the month (so it returns upcoming events). We are not specifying modern because the function doesn't have a parameter for it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put \"modern sculpture\" in the art_form and see if the function can handle it? We don't know, but it's worth a try.\n\nLet's try with art_form=\"modern sculpture\". If the function doesn't support it, then it might return nothing? But that's the best we can do.\n\nSo we'll do:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n<params>\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"art_form\" value=\"modern sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n<param name=\"user_ratings\" value=\"high\" type=\"string\"/>\n</params>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nBut note: the function has an optional parameter for month. We are not including it because we want the default (upcoming events). Also, the user_ratings is optional and we are setting it to \"high\", which is the default? But we set it explicitly to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave out user_ratings? But the question says \"top rated\", so we want to set the threshold. We'll set it.\n\nBut note: the function expects user_ratings as a string, and we are setting it to \"high\". That should be acceptable.\n\nSo, we output the above."}
