The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nThe parameters required for calculate_displacement are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe default to 2. \n\nWait, the default for rounding is 2, but the user didn't mention it, so I should include it. So the function call would be calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5, rounding=2. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters here.

The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The default region is United States, but maybe the user specified it, but the question says \"United States\" as the default. Wait, the function's default region is 'True', but the user's question mentions United States. However, the function's default is set to 'True', which might be a typo or default value. But regardless, the user's question specifies the region as United States. So I need to call 'video_games.store_price' with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', and region 'United States'. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for store_price have region as a string with default 'United States'. So even if the user says United States, the function will use that. So the correct function call would be store_price with those parameters. There's no need to use the other functions like on_sale or store_currency since the question is about price, not sale status or currency. So the answer is to call store_price with those arguments."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going. They mentioned it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the kinematics equations. Since the object starts from rest, initial speed is 0. The formula for final speed when starting from rest under constant acceleration is v = u + at, where u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. But wait, maybe they want the speed directly from the distance and time. Oh, there's another function called calculate_speed_from_rest which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. Since it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So using that function with distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds should give the speed.\n\nWait, the user's question says \"how fast\" so the answer would be the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest is designed for that scenario. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance 20 and time 4, so those are the parameters. So the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with those values. There's no need to use the acceleration function here because the question is about speed, not acceleration. So the answer is to call that function with the given parameters."}
