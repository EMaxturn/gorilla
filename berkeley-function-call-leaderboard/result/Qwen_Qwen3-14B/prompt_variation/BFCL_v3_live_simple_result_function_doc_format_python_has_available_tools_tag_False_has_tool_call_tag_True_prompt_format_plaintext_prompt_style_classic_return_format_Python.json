Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires city and date parameters. The city is Rutherford, NJ, and the date is April 22nd, 2023. I need to format the date as 'YYYY-MM-DD', so that would be '2023-04-22'. The function has a default date, but since the user specified a date, I should use that. I'll call the function with city='Rutherford, NJ' and date='2023-04-22'."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function. The parameters include directed_by, genre, and cast. The user specified the director as James Gray, so I should set directed_by to \"James Gray\". They didn't mention genre or cast, so I'll leave those as default 'dontcare'. That should retrieve movies directed by him. I need to make sure I only include the directed_by parameter here."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the play_spotify_song function. The parameters needed are query, shuffle, and volume. The query should be in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName'. So the song is \"Dil Nu\" and the artist is Maninder Buttar. I need to format the query correctly. Shuffle and volume have defaults, so I can omit them unless specified. The user didn't mention shuffle or volume, so just use the defaults. So the function call should be play_spotify_song with the query parameter set to 'track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar'. That should do it."}

The date is 16th March 2024, which in dd/mm/yyyy format is 16/03/2024. The date needs to be after 14/03/2024, so that's okay.

I don't see any missing info here. The user didn't mention return date or other details, but the function only requires departure info. So I can proceed with the given parameters."}
