The initial_velocity is zero, so I should include that. Gravity is optional with a default of 9.81, so maybe I can omit it. Wait, the parameters for the function: height is required, initial_velocity is optional with default zero, and gravity is optional with default 9.81. So in this case, since the user says initial velocity is zero, which is the default, but maybe it's better to include it explicitly to be clear. But the function's parameters say initial_velocity is an integer, but the user might have intended it as a float. Wait, the function's parameters for initial_velocity are type integer, but the description says it's in m/s. Hmm, but the user is saying initial velocity is zero, which is an integer. So I can call the function with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity is not needed since it's default. So the function call would be calculate_final_velocity with height 150 and initial_velocity 0. Alternatively, since initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, maybe I can omit it. But the user explicitly states initial velocity is zero, so including it makes it clear. Let me check the function's required parameters: only height is required.

The status has a default of 'ongoing', so if the user specifies 'ongoing', we can include that, but since the default is already ongoing, maybe it's not necessary unless the user specifies otherwise. But the user did mention \"ongoing lawsuits\", so maybe it's better to explicitly set the status to 'ongoing' to be safe.\n\nThe start_date needs to be in MM-DD-YYY format.

But the user said \"after January 1, 2021\", which would mean starting from January 2, 2021. However, the function's start_date is a single date. Maybe the function is designed to take a start date, and the end date is not part of the parameters. So perhaps the user's query is to start from January 1, 2021, and the function will handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to exclude January 1, 2021. But since the function's parameter is a start date, maybe the user's intention is to set start_date as January 1, 2021, and the function will return lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user said \"after\", which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, I think the best approach is to set start_date to \"01-01-2021\" as the earliest date. The user might have intended that.\n\nThe location is California, which is a full state name, so that's correct. The company is Google. The status is ongoing, which is the default, but since the user specified it, maybe include it explicitly.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nlawsuit_search with company=\"Google\", start_date=\"01-01-2021\", location=\"California\", status=\"ongoing\".\n\nWait, but the required parameters are company, start_date, location.

There's also an optional preferences array with options like pet_friendly, gym, etc.\n\nThe user specified \"pet friendly\", so I should include that in the preferences. The location is Manhattan, New York. Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The function requires the start_date as a string. I need to format that correctly, probably as YYYY-MM-DD. So March 10th, 2023 would be 2023-03-10.\n\nCheck if all required parameters are present. Location (Manhattan, New York), room_type (single), duration (3), start_date (2023-03-10). Preferences include pet_friendly. The other parameters like gym, swimming_pool, etc., are optional and not mentioned, so they can be omitted. The default is to use all if not specified, but since the user only mentions pet_friendly, I should include that in the array.\n\nSo the function call should have location as \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type \"single\", duration 3, start_date \"2023-03-10\", and preferences [\"pet_friendly\"].\n\nWait, the preferences are an array of strings from the enum. So the user's request specifically mentions pet_friendly, so that's the only one needed. The other preferences are optional and not required here. So the parameters are correctly set."}
