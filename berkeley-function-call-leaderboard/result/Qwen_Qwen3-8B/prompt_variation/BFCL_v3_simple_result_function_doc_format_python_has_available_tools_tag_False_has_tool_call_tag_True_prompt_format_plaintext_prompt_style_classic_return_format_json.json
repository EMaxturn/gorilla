The height here is 150 meters. The initial velocity is given as zero, so I should set that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different value. Since the problem doesn't mention any other gravity, I'll use the default.

Since they want two sixes in a row, I need to multiply the probability of each individual event. So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the functions provided, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters. The function takes desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides. The desired_number here is 6, number_of_rolls is 2. The die_sides is 6, which is the default, so maybe I don't need to specify it. \n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the probability of rolling a certain number a certain number of times in a row. So calling this function with desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides=6 should give the correct probability. Since die_sides is optional and defaults to 6, I can omit it.

The user wants to book a single room at a pet friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required args are location, room_type, duration, start_date, and optional preferences.\n\nThe location is specified as near Manhattan, New York. So I'll put \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location. Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The user mentioned pet friendly, which is a preference. So preferences should include 'pet friendly'.\n\nWait, the preferences parameter is a list. So I need to make sure to format that correctly. The function allows preferences as an optional list. So I'll include that in the parameters. Let me double-check all required parameters are present: location, room_type, duration, start_date. Yes, all there. Preferences is optional but provided here. So the function call should include all these. Alright, that should do it."}
