The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which should be fine here.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to use the linear_regression_fit function. The parameters required are x and y, which are the arrays from the data. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Also, they want residuals, so return_residuals should be True.\n\nWait, but the data_loading function returns the data structure. So first, I need to call data_loading to get the data. Then, extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns from that data. But in the function calls, I can't process the data directly; I have to pass the parameters as they are. So the user's instruction is to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], which implies that after loading the data into 'data', those columns are used.\n\nSo the steps are: load the data, then fit the model with the specified x and y, and return residuals. Therefore, two function calls are needed. First, data_loading to get the data, then linear_regression_fit using the loaded data's columns. The residuals are requested, so return_residuals is True.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly named. For data_loading, file_path is 'dataset.csv'. For linear_regression_fit, x is the 'sales' array from the data, y is 'future_sales', and return_residuals is True. The user didn't mention any delimiter, so default is comma.

There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it's about retrieving the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nFor the first sculpture: Philadelphia, marble, size 4x4. The size is an array of integers, so [4,4]. For the second: New York, bronze, size 6x3, which would be [6,3]. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking for the average price of both. However, the function get_artwork_price might return the price for each individual sculpture. So I need to call the function twice, once for each sculpture, and then calculate the average. \n\nBut the functions available don't have an average function. The user might need to get each price and then compute the average themselves. So the assistant should call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then sum the two prices and divide by two. However, the functions can't perform calculations, only retrieve data. So the correct approach is to make two separate calls and then inform the user to average them. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nget_artwork_price(museum_location=\"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4]), get_artwork_price(museum_location=\"New York\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3])\n\nThen, once both prices are retrieved, the average can be calculated.

The user has three parts to their question.\n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The function for that is biological.calc_energy. The parameters required are mols and substance. The substance here is glucose, which has the formula C6H12O6. The default joules_per_mol is 2800, which matches the given value, so I don't need to specify that unless it's different. So the first call would be calc_energy with mols=5 and substance=\"C6H12O6\".\n\nNext, using the energy from the first step, calculate the biomass with a 10% efficiency. The function here is biological.calc_biomass. The required parameter is energy, which comes from the first calculation. The efficiency is given as 10%, which is the default, so even if not specified, it would use 0.1. But since the user explicitly mentions 10%, maybe include it for clarity. So the second call would be calc_biomass with energy=result_from_first_step and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, calculate the work done by the machine moving 2 meters. The function is physical.calc_work, which needs energy and distance. The energy here is the same as the first step's total energy. The distance is 2 meters. So the third call is calc_work with energy=result_from_first_step and distance=2.\n\nWait, but the user says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance\".

The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So principle_amount is 5000, duration is 5 years, annual_rate is 4. I need to make sure the rate is in percentage, which it is here.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually over 5 years. The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. Parameters are principle_amount (5000), duration (5), annual_rate (3.5), and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1. The function has a default of 1, so maybe I can omit it, but including it explicitly might be better.\n\nThird option: Initial investment of $3000 at 5% for 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function specified is future_value. Parameters needed are initial_investment (3000), interest_rate (5% as a decimal, so 0.05?), time (6 years), and num_compoundings (2).

Wait, no, the note says: \"for the 1700s, input '18'.\" Wait, that seems off. Wait, the 1700s would be the 18th century. So the function's parameter for century is the century number, but the example says for the 1700s (which is 18th century), input '18'. So the user says 17th century, which is 1600s, so the century parameter should be 17? Wait, no. Wait, the example says for the 1700s (which is the 18th century), input '18'.
