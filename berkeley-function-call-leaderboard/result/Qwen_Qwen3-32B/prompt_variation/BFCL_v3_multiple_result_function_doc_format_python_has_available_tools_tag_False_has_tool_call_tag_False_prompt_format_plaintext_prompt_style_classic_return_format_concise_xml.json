The parameters required are initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, default is 2, so maybe I can include that or leave it out. But since the user didn't specify rounding, maybe just use the default. So the function call should have those three parameters. Let me check the function's parameters again. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. So I can proceed with the three given values. No missing parameters here. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement. So the correct function to call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with the given values."}

The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I should call video_games.store_price with these parameters. I don't need to check if it's on sale because the store_price function should return the current price, which might already be the sale price. If it's on sale, the price would reflect that. But if the user wants to confirm if it's on sale, maybe I should also call on_sale. However, the question is specifically about the price, so just getting the store price should suffice. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The platform is 'PlayStation', region is 'United States'. The function should return the price, which is the answer they need."}

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember there are kinematic equations. The user mentioned starting from rest, so initial speed is 0. They gave distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_speed_from_rest. The parameters it needs are distance, time, and initial_speed (which defaults to 0). That fits perfectly here. The function is designed exactly for this scenario where the object starts from rest (initial speed 0) and calculates the speed based on distance and time under constant acceleration. \n\nSo I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is already 0 by default, so no need to specify it unless necessary. Let me double-check the parameters: distance is an integer, time is an integer. The function returns the speed. That should give the correct final speed. I don't see any missing parameters here. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't needed because the question is about finding speed, not acceleration. So the right call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with the given values."}

Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nThe function calculate_final_temperature seems relevant here. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function.

The parameters are elements (the list) and order (default 'asc'). Since the user specified ascending, which is the default, I don't need to set the order parameter. \n\nSo I should call sort_list with elements as the provided list and order as 'asc' or just rely on the default. But since the user explicitly said ascending, maybe include it for clarity. Wait, the default is 'asc', so even if I omit the order, it will still sort in ascending. But including it might make the intention clearer. However, the function's parameters show that order is optional with a default of 'asc'. So either way is correct. \n\nI think the correct approach is to pass the elements and set order to 'asc' as per the user's request. So the function call would be sort_list with elements ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order 'asc'. The function should return the sorted list. I don't see any other functions that can perform sorting here. The other functions are for filtering and summing, which don't apply. So the correct function to call is sort_list."}

That's 6 combinations. So the probability would be 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's the dice_roll_probability function. The parameters needed are desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The default for n_rolls is 1, but here we need two dice. Wait, the n_rolls parameter might be the number of dice rolled.

The parameters need to be checked. The function's args are location (str), art_form (str), month (str, default upcoming), and user_ratings (str, default 'high').

The month is upcoming, so using the default, but the function's default might be set to return upcoming events. \n\nWait, the function's description says the month has a default value that returns upcoming events. So if the user says \"upcoming month,\" we can leave the month parameter as default. But the function's args for month have a default, so we can omit it. So the parameters would be location: \"New York\", art_form: \"sculpture\" (since the function's example uses \"sculpture\", maybe the exact term matters?), but the user said \"modern sculpture\".
