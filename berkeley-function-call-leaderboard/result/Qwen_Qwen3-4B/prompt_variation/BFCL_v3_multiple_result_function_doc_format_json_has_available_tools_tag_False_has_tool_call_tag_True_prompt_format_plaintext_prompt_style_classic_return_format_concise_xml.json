The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The parameters required are distance and time, and initial_speed is optional with a default of 0. The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, so even if not provided, it's okay.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're the same gas, the formula simplifies to (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2). Wait, is that right? Let me think. For ideal gases, the internal energy depends on temperature and moles. So when mixing, the total internal energy is the sum of each part. So U_total = n1*C*T1 + n2*C*T2. Then the final temperature T_final would be U_total / (n1 + n2) * 1/C. Since C is the same for both, it cancels out. So yes, T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2).\n\nSo the parameters here are quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. The function calculate_final_temperature requires all four parameters. The user provided all of them, so I can call that function. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed here because the question is about temperature, not mass. So the correct tool call is to calculate_final_temperature with those values."}

The n_rolls is optional and defaults to 1, but since the user mentioned two dice, maybe that's covered by sides_per_die? Wait, no. Wait, the parameters for dice_roll_probability: n_rolls is the number of dice rolled. Wait, the description says \"number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\". So if the user is rolling two dice, then n_rolls should be 2. But the desired_sum is 7. Wait, but the function's parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls (optional, default 1), and sides_per_die (required). So in this case, the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls is 2. The sides_per_die is 6. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the function's required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. So n_rolls is optional. So the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls is 2. So the parameters are desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. That should be correct. Let me check the function's parameters again. The required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die.
