Since the question is about displacement, I should use the calculate_displacement function.\n\nChecking the parameters for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time are required. The user provided all three: 20, 10, and 5. There's an optional rounding parameter with a default of 2, but the user didn't specify a rounding requirement. So I can omit that or use the default. The function should handle it. So the correct call is to use calculate_displacement with those values. No need for the final speed function here.

The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified all three: the game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I need to call store_price with these parameters. \n\nWait, the region is optional in the function, but the user specified the United States, so I should include it. The other functions are for checking if a game is on sale or the currency, which aren't directly relevant here. The user wants the price, so store_price is the right choice. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters. The required ones are game_title and platform, which are provided.

The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I need to call that function with those parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem statement since it starts from rest. So I should use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't needed here because we're not given initial and final speeds or time, but the user is asking for speed, not acceleration. So the correct function call is calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

So if they're rolling two dice, n_rolls should be 2. But the function's description says n_rolls is the number of dice to be rolled, default 1. So in this case, the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls=2. The sides_per_die is not specified, but standard dice have 6 sides. So I'll assume sides_per_die is 6. The required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the parameters for the function: the n_rolls is optional, default 1. But the user is rolling two dice, so we need to set n_rolls=2. The sides_per_die is required, so I need to include that.

The frequency can be omitted since it's optional and defaults to annually.\n\nAnother function is stock_market_data, but that's for stock market data, not dividends. So I shouldn't use that.
