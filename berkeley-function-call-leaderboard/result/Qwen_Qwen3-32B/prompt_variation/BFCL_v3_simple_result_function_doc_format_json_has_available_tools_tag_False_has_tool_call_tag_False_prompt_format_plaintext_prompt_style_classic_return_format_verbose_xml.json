The database parameter has a default value of 'CustomerInfo', so if the user specifies a different one, we use that.

Each roll of a six-sided die has a 1/6 chance of landing on six. Since they want two sixes in a row, that's two independent events. So the probabilities should multiply.\n\nThe function provided is probability.dice_roll. Let me check the parameters. It requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides. The user specified a six-sided die, so die_sides is 6, which is the default. The desired_number is 6, and number_of_rolls is 2. So I should call the function with those parameters. I don't see any missing parameters here. The function should calculate (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. So the correct function call would include desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides=6, though die_sides can be omitted since it's default. But including it might be clearer. Wait, the parameters required are desired_number and number_of_rolls, so die_sides is optional.

The function's start_date is the start of the range, so if they want after, maybe the start_date is the next day?

Wait, but the function's parameters only have start_date, not end_date. So the function might be designed to take a start date and maybe an end date? Wait, looking back at the parameters: the function's parameters only have start_date. The description says \"date range\" but the parameters only have start_date. That's confusing. Wait, the parameters for the function are: start_date is the start of the date range. So perhaps the end_date is not a parameter here. So the user wants lawsuits filed after Jan 1, 2021, so the start_date would be 01-01-2021. But if the function's start_date is inclusive, then it would include that date. The user says \"after\", which might mean exclusive. But since the function might not support end_date, perhaps the user's query can only be approximated by setting the start_date to 01-01-2021. Maybe the function allows a range, but the user hasn't provided an end date, so perhaps the function will return all lawsuits from that start_date onwards. So proceed with that.\n\nSo the function call should be:\n\nlawsuit_search with company=Google, start_date=01-01-2021, location=California, status=ongoing.\n\nYes, that should do it."}

But how to determine the exact dates programmatically? Well, the function's parameters are strings, so maybe the user expects a relative term like \"next month\". However, the function might need an absolute date range. Since the user hasn't provided exact dates, perhaps the function can handle relative terms. But the description says \"time frame to get the concert for,\" which could be a range. To be safe, I'll use \"next month\" as the date value. Wait, but the example parameters in the function's description might expect a specific format. Let me check again. The parameters for date have a description \"Time frame to get the concert for.\" The example in the parameters isn't given, but the type is string. The user's input is \"next month,\" so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, if the system requires a specific date range, but since the user hasn't provided exact dates, perhaps the function can handle relative terms. I'll proceed with the date as \"next month\". So the parameters would be location: \"New York\", date: \"next month\", genre: \"Pop\". Let me make sure all required parameters are included. Yes, location, date, genre are all there. The genre is Pop, which is in the enum. So the function call should be correct."}

The parameters are provided in the question: song_title is \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and artist_name is \"Queen\". The lang parameter is optional with a default of English, so I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different language. Since they didn't mention a language, I'll omit lang. So the function call should include song_title and artist_name. Let me make sure those are the required fields. Yes, the required parameters are song_title and artist_name.

The other parameters have defaults: returnAllPossibleKeys is false by default, and assumeMajor is true by default.\n\nSince the user didn't specify whether to return all possible keys or assume major, I should use the default values. So the function call should include the progression and rely on the defaults for the other parameters. That means the function will return the first valid major key it finds. I don't see any missing parameters here. The required parameter is progression, which is provided. So the correct function call is to use the given progression with the defaults."}

They didn't mention a specific location, so I can leave that out. All required parameters are present. So I should call the function with those values.

The required fields are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The user provided all of these: location is Manhattan, New York, room_type is single, duration is 3 nights, and start_date is March 10th, 2023. \n\nAdditionally, the user specified a preference for a pet-friendly hotel. The preferences parameter is an array that includes options like pet_friendly. So I should include that in the preferences array.\n\nWait, the location parameter is a string. The user said \"near Manhattan, New York\". Should I use \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location? Yes, that's the city they want. The function's location parameter is a string, so that's correct.\n\nThe start_date is March 10th, 2023. The format for the date isn't specified, but the function expects a string. It's safer to use a standard date format like \"YYYY-MM-DD\", so March 10th would be \"2023-03-10\".\n\nPreferences: The user mentioned \"pet friendly\", which is one of the enum options. So the preferences array should include \"pet_friendly\". The other preferences are optional, and the default is to use all if not specified, but since the user specifically asked for pet-friendly, we need to include it.\n\nPutting it all together: call hotel_booking with location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"2023-03-10\", and preferences=[\"pet_friendly\"].\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The duration is an integer, so 3 is correct. The preferences is an array of strings from the enum. All required parameters are present. Looks good."}
