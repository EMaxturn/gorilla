The function's description says unit is a string, so maybe \"metric\" is acceptable. But I should check if the function expects a specific value. The parameters for get_current_weather have unit as optional, so I can set it to \"metric\". The location for Guangzhou is \"Guangzhou, CN\" and Beijing is \"Beijing, CN\".

The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function is perfect for this. The parameters needed are repo_url and optionally destination. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default which is the current directory. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. For this, the create_a_docker_file function is needed. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, I'll use the directory_name as the cloned repo's path. But wait, the clone_repo function's destination parameter is optional. If the user didn't specify, maybe the default is the current directory. So I'll call clone_repo first, then create_a_docker_file with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function is for this. The parameter is directory_name again. So after cloning, the directory_name would be the same as the cloned repo's path. So I need to call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with that directory_name.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function is for this. The parameters are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user didn't specify commit message or branch, so I'll use default values. The commit message can be \"Initial commit\" and branch_name as \"main\" (assuming the default branch). Force_push is optional, but maybe set to true if needed. However, the user didn't mention force push, so maybe leave it as false. But the function requires directory_name, which is already set from the clone_repo.\n\nWait, but the push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it pushes all changes from the local repo. So after cloning, the user would have the repo in the current directory. So the directory_name would be the cloned repo's path. But the clone_repo function's destination is optional. If the user didn't specify, the default is the current directory. So the directory_name for push_git_changes_to_github would be the same as the cloned repo's path.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination as default.\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with same directory_name.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, commit message, branch, and force_push.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the functions are called in the correct order and parameters are correctly set. Also, check if the parameters are required. For example, clone_repo requires repo_url, which is provided. The other functions require directory_name, which is set after cloning.\n\nSo the JSON calls would be:\n\nFirst, clone_repo with repo_url as \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" and destination as the default (current directory). Then create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the cloned repo's path. Then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with same directory_name. Then push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name, commit message (default), branch (default), and force_push (default).\n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly."}

The user is encountering a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the 'get_relevant_classes' function seems appropriate. The parameters required are a search string, case sensitivity, and include_subdirectories. The search string here would be 'CellResult', and they want to include subdirectories, so set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. However, the parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user is asking for the signatures of these two methods, so I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The class_name would be 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method_name would be 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. Since the user didn't specify whether to include private methods, I'll leave include_private as false unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides the methods. So the 'AbstractCellHandler' is the parent class. The get_signature function needs to be called for each method. So I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The parameters for each call would be class_name as 'AbstractCellHandler' and method_name as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'.\n\nSo the plan is: first, use get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true. Then, call get_signature twice, once for each method. The functions to call are get_relevant_classes and get_signature for each method. The parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private (default false). So the JSON calls would be:\n\nFor get_relevant_classes:\n{\n  \"function\": \"get_relevant_classes\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"search_string\": \"CellResult\",\n    \"include_subdirectories\": true\n  }\n}\n\nFor get_signature:\nFirst call:\n{\n  \"function\": \"get_signature\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"class_name\": \"AbstractCellHandler\",\n    \"method_name\": \"setCellValue\",\n    \"include_private\": false\n  }\n}\n\nSecond call:\n{\n  \"function\": \"get_signature\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"class_name\": \"AbstractCellHandler\",\n    \"method_name\": \"getCellValue\",\n    \"include_private\": false\n  }\n}\n\nThat should cover both parts of the user's request. The user also mentioned that the error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult', so the relevant classes function should help find classes related to CellResult. The signatures for the methods in AbstractCellHandler will help ensure the user is overriding them correctly."}

The get_current_weather function needs a location parameter. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\". I need to check if the format is correct. The example given in the function's params is \"San Francisco, CA\" or \"Paris, France\". Queenstown is in Singapore, so maybe the format should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function doesn't specify a required format, so I'll use that.\n\nSo I need to call both functions. The parameters are straightforward. No missing parameters here.

The description says \"cultural events, such as concerts and plays\", so it's okay to use either. But the user mentioned both concerts and plays, so maybe using both as separate calls? Wait, but the function might handle it with one call. Let me see the parameters again. The event_type is a single string, so I can specify one of them. The user might want both, but the function might return either. Alternatively, maybe the user wants both, so perhaps two separate calls.
