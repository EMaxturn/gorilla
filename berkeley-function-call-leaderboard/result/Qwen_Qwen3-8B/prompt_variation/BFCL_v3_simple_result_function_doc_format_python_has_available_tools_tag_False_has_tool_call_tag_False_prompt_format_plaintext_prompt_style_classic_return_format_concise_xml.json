The user wants to calculate the final velocity of an object falling from a 150-meter building with an initial velocity of zero. I remember there's a function called calculate_final_velocity that does this. Let me check the parameters. The function requires height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height here is 150 meters. The initial velocity is given as zero, so I should set that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user provides a different value. Since the user didn't mention any other gravity, I'll use the default. So the function call should include height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Wait, the parameters are all integers except gravity, which is a float. So the parameters would be height as 150 (int), initial_velocity as 0 (int), and gravity as 9.81 (float). But since gravity is optional, maybe I can omit it. Let me check the function definition again. The function's parameters have default values for initial_velocity and gravity. So the user's question provides height and initial_velocity (which is zero), so I need to include those. Wait, the initial_velocity's default is zero, but the user explicitly says initial velocity is zero. So including it is better. But maybe the function can handle it either way. However, to be precise, I should include initial_velocity=0. So the function call would be calculate_final_velocity with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. Wait, but gravity is optional. The user didn't specify a different gravity, so maybe I can leave it out. But the function's default is 9.81, so it's okay. So the correct parameters are height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Let me make sure. The function's parameters are height (int), initial_velocity (int, default 0), gravity (float, default 9.81). So the user's question provides height=150, initial_velocity=0, so I need to include those. But since initial_velocity is default, maybe it's optional. However, the user specified it, so including it is better. So the function call would be calculate_final_velocity with height=150, initial_velocity=0. Gravity is not needed because it's default. So the parameters are height and initial_velocity. Wait, but the function's parameters are height, initial_velocity, and gravity.

Then combine these two tuples into a list.\n\nSo the conditions parameter would be a list containing those two tuples. Let me check the function definition again.

{"id": "simple_134", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to predict the total expected profit from investing $5000 in stocks XYZ over 5 years with an annual return rate of 7%. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's the investment.predictProfit function. Let me look at its parameters. It requires investment_amount (int), annual_return (float), and years (int). \n\nThe user provided all three: $5000 is the investment amount, 7% is the annual return, and 5 years. So I need to convert 7% into a decimal for the function. Wait, the function expects annual_return as a float. So 7% would be 0.07. \n\nWait, but maybe the function expects it as 7.0? The description says annual_return is a float, so 7.0 would be correct. Let me confirm. The user said 7%, so converting that to 0.07 is standard, but maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Wait, the function's parameter is annual_return, which is a float. So if the user says 7%, the function might expect 7.0, but sometimes in finance, percentages are converted to decimal form. Hmm, but the function's documentation doesn't specify. However, since the user provided 7%, I should probably pass 7.0 as the annual_return. Wait, but maybe the function expects 0.07. Wait, the function's description says annual return rate, so 7% would be 0.07. But the user might have intended to input 7 as a percentage. Wait, this is a bit ambiguous. However, the function's parameter is a float, so either 7.0 or 0.07 would be acceptable, but which one is correct? Let me think. Typically, annual return rate is expressed as a decimal, so 7% would be 0.07. But sometimes, people might input 7.0 as the percentage. However, the function's parameters don't specify, so I need to make an assumption. Since the user wrote 7%, I should convert that to 0.07. But maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Wait, the function's name is predictProfit, and the parameters are investment_amount, annual_return, years. Let me check the example. If the user says 7%, then annual_return should be 0.07. But maybe the function is designed to take 7.0 as the percentage. Hmm. Well, the user's input is 7%, so I need to make sure the parameters are correct. Wait, the user's question is in Chinese, but the parameters are all there. So, the parameters are all present.

Let me check the functions available. There's the calculate_future_value function. The parameters needed are initial_investment, interest_rate, duration, and compounded. The user provided $1000, which is the initial investment. The annual interest rate is 5%, so as a decimal that's 0.05. The duration is 2 years. The compounded parameter is optional, defaulting to 1. Since they didn't specify compounding frequency, I'll use the default. So I have all the required parameters. Let me structure the function call with these values."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the civil_cases.retrieve function. The parameters required are year, crime_type, and location. The year is 2020, which is an integer. The crime type is theft, a string. The location is Los Angeles, California. Wait, the function's location parameter expects a city name. Should I put the full city and state or just the city? The example says city name, but maybe including the state is better for accuracy. Let me check the function's description again. It says location in the format of city name. Hmm, maybe just the city is enough, but sometimes including the state helps. However, the user specified \"Los Angeles, California\", so maybe I should use that as the location parameter. Alternatively, maybe the function expects just the city, so perhaps \"Los Angeles\". But the user's input includes the state. I need to decide whether to include it. Since the function's parameter is a string for location, and the user provided the full name, I'll use \"Los Angeles, California\" as the location. So the parameters would be year=2020, crime_type=\"theft\", location=\"Los Angeles, California\". That should cover all the required parameters. Let me make sure all parameters are present. Yes, the function requires all three, and the user provided all. So the function call should be correct."}

tackle this query. The user wants to search for ongoing lawsuits related to Google filed after January 1, 2021, in California.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available function. The function is lawsuit_search. Let me look at its parameters. The parameters are company (str), start_date (str), location (str), and status (str) with a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe user specified 'ongoing' status, which matches the default. So I don't need to set status unless they want something else. The company is Google. The start_date is after January 1, 2021. The function's start_date is a string in MM-DD-YYY format. So January 1, 2021 would be '01-01-2021'. The location is California, which is the full state name. \n\nWait, the user says \"filed after January 1, 2021\". Does the function's start_date parameter represent the start of the date range? The description says \"date range\", but the example might be inclusive. However, the user wants lawsuits filed after that date. But the function's start_date is the start of the range. Maybe the function is designed to take a start date and an end date, but the parameters only include start_date. Wait, looking back, the function's parameters are company, start_date, location, status. Wait, maybe the function only takes a start_date and not an end_date. That could be an issue. Because the user wants lawsuits filed after a certain date, but if the function only allows a start_date, perhaps it's designed to find lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the problem is, the user might need to specify an end date as well. However, the function's parameters don't include an end_date. So maybe the function is designed to take a start_date and location, etc. \n\nAssuming that the start_date is the earliest date, and the function will return lawsuits filed from that date onwards. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, setting start_date to '01-01-2021' would include that date and later. But the user might want strictly after, but since the function's parameters don't have an end date, perhaps that's the best we can do. \n\nSo the parameters would be company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', status='ongoing'. Since status defaults to ongoing, maybe it's optional. But the user explicitly mentioned ongoing, so maybe it's better to include it. But the function call needs to be made. \n\nWait, the function calls need to be in the format of <functions>...</functions> with parameters. So, the user's question is to find the correct function calls. \n\nSo, the answer is to call the function with the parameters. Let me check again. \n\nYes, the function calls should be made in the format specified. So, the final answer is to call the function with the given parameters."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. Preferences is optional.\n\nThe user specified \"single room\", so room_type should be 'single'. Location is \"Manhattan, New York\", but maybe just 'New York' is enough? Wait, the function's location parameter is a string, so I can put \"Manhattan, New York\" as the location. The duration is 3 nights, so that's an integer. Start_date is March 10th, 2023. The date format should be 'YYYY-MM-DD' probably. So March 10th, 2023 would be '2023-03-10'.\n\nPreferences: the user mentioned \"pet friendly\", so that should be included in the preferences list. The function's preferences parameter is a list, so I'll add 'pet friendly' to that list.\n\nWait, the function's parameters: the start_date is a string. So I need to format the date correctly. The user said March 10th, 2023. So the correct format would be '2023-03-10'. Also, the duration is 3 nights, which is an integer. \n\nPutting it all together: location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is 'single', duration is 3, start_date is '2023-03-10', and preferences is ['pet friendly'].\n\nI should check if all required parameters are present. Yes, location, room_type, duration, start_date are all there. Preferences is optional but provided here. So the function call should include all these parameters. \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the function call accordingly."}
