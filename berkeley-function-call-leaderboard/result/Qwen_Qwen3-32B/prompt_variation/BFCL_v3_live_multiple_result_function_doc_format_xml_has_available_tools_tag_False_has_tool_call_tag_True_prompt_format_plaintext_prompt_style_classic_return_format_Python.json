The user is asking for an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc (string), type (string), and time (integer). The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. All required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2, its description says it's for finding weather at a location, which doesn't seem relevant here. Also, the parameters for ride2 require loc in 'City, State' format, but the user provided a full street address. Plus, the type parameter in ride2 is required, but the function's purpose is about weather, so that might be a mistake in the function setup. Since the user is asking for a ride, not weather, uber.ride is the correct choice.\n\nSo, the correct function call is uber.ride with loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='Plus', time=10."}

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include searching in recall memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user's question is about a person's birthday, it's possible that information might be in the core memory's 'human' section or in the archival memory. \n\nI should start by checking the core memory. The 'human' section in core memory stores key details about the user. But wait, the user here is asking about Shishir Patil, not the current user. So maybe the core memory isn't the right place. \n\nNext, I can try the recall memory search. The 'recall_memory_search' function allows searching the conversation history. If Shishir Patil's birthday was mentioned in previous messages, this function can find it. Let me use that. The query would be \"Shishir Patil birthday\". \n\nIf that doesn't return the birthday, I might need to check the archival memory. But the user hasn't provided any prior information, so maybe the data isn't there. If I can't find the birthday, I should inform the user that I don't have that information. \n\nOnce I have the birthday, I can use the 'send_message' function to send a congratulation message. The recipient would be Shishir Patil's contact info, but the user hasn't provided that. Wait, the user didn't specify the recipient's details. The 'send_message' function requires a recipient parameter. Since the user hasn't given Shishir's email or phone number, I can't send the message. \n\nHmm, so I need to first find the birthday and then the contact info.

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the October 2019 statement period. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The BankStatementOverView function seems necessary because it provides an overview of the bank statement with account info. The parameters required are bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided the bank name (U.S. Bank), account number, account type (business checking), and full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING). The transaction overview would need a summary, which might come from another function.\n\nLooking at the transaction_summary.generate function, it requires transactions, dates, totals, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. The Alltransactions function could retrieve transactions for a period, but the user didn't mention needing individual transactions, just a summary. The TotalTransactions.calculate function could compute totals, but the user already provided deposit and withdrawal amounts.\n\nWait, the user has given the total deposits and withdrawals, starting and ending balances. The BankStatementOverView needs a transaction_overview as a dict. Maybe the transaction_summary.generate can create that summary. But to use that, I need the transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. Since they didn't list individual transactions, maybe the transaction_summary can be generated with the totals provided. However, the function requires individual transactions. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the TotalTransactions.calculate can be used to compute the totals, but the user already provided those. The user might expect the overview to include those numbers. So perhaps the transaction_overview parameter for BankStatementOverView can be constructed using the given totals. But the function's description says it's a summary including totals and counts. The user provided total deposits and withdrawals, so maybe that's sufficient. But the function might expect more structured data.\n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview is a dict. The user's provided data includes starting balance, ending balance, total deposits, total withdrawals. Maybe that can be formatted into the transaction_overview dict. Let me check the parameters again. The transaction_overview is a summary, so perhaps including those totals in the dict would work. For example:\n\ntransaction_overview = {\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what the function expects. The function's description says it's a summary of transactions within the period, including totals and counts. The user didn't mention the number of transactions, but maybe that's optional. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, perhaps the function can still be called with the available data.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided account details and the transaction_overview constructed from the given totals.\n2. Since the user also wants a summary of transactions, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed. However, without individual transactions, this might not be possible. The user might have intended to use the Alltransactions function to get the transactions for October 2019, but they didn't ask for individual transactions, just a summary. Since they provided the totals, maybe the summary can be generated with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be called with the given totals and customer info. But the function requires transactions array, which the user hasn't provided. So perhaps the correct approach is to use BankStatementOverView with the given data and the transaction_overview as the provided totals, and then use transaction_summary.generate with the same data, but since transactions are missing, that might not work.\n\nWait, the user might have intended to use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to compute the totals, but they already provided them. So maybe the answer is to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and the transaction_overview as the provided totals, and then use the transaction_summary.generate with the same data, but since transactions are missing, perhaps it's not possible. Therefore, the main function to call is BankStatementOverView with the given data, and the transaction_overview parameter filled with the provided totals and balances.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nBankStatementOverView(\n    bank_name=\"U.S. Bank\",\n    account_number=\"1-523-1713-5704\",\n    account_type=\"checking\",\n    full_name=\"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\",\n    transaction_overview={\n        \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n        \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n        \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n        \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n    }\n)\n\nBut I need to check if the transaction_overview is supposed to be a summary that includes counts and other details. Since the user didn't provide individual transactions, maybe the function can still be called with the available data. The user's question is to provide an overview, so this might be sufficient."}

The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. It requires category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate price, which I can map to a price range. The location is New York, but the function expects 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and state is NY, I'll use 'New York, NY'. They also want outdoor seating, so set has_seating_outdoors to true. The category isn't specified, but it's a required parameter. Hmm, maybe the user didn't mention it. Wait, the function requires category, so I can't leave it out. But the user didn't specify a cuisine type. Maybe I should assume a general category or ask for clarification. However, since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps I need to proceed with the available parameters. Wait, no, the category is required. Oh, the user just said \"restaurants\" generally. Maybe the category can be left as a general term, but the function requires it. Wait, the function's description says \"based on specified location, category, and other optional preferences.\" Since the user didn't specify a category, maybe I need to handle that. But the function requires it. This is a problem. Wait, looking back at the function parameters, category is required. So I need to have a value for it. The user hasn't provided one. So perhaps I should make an assumption, but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to mention a category but forgot. However, since the user hasn't provided it, I can't proceed without it. Wait, but the user's query is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Maybe the category is not specified, so perhaps the function allows a general search. Wait, the function's parameters require category. So I need to include it. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I can use a default value like \"any\" or leave it blank. But the function requires it. This is an issue. Wait, maybe the user's message is incomplete. Alternatively, perhaps the category can be omitted if the user doesn't specify, but the function requires it. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the function with the given parameters, but since category is required, I need to include it. Since the user hasn't provided a category, maybe I should use a general term like \"restaurants\" or \"dining\". Wait, the category parameter's description says \"The type of cuisine or food category offered by the restaurant.\" So if the user didn't specify, perhaps the assistant should use a default value, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant must include a category. Since the user hasn't provided one, maybe the assistant should make an assumption, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, the assistant might need to ask for clarification. However, the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps the assistant should proceed with a generic category. Wait, but the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant should use a placeholder, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can't proceed without the category. But the user's query doesn't include it. Hmm. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the user intended to mention a category but forgot. But given the current information, the assistant must proceed. Since the user is looking for restaurants in general, maybe the category can be set to an empty string or a general term. However, the function requires it. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should proceed with a default category, but the function doesn't allow that. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the function with the available parameters, but since category is required, the assistant must include it. Since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the assistant should use a general term like \"dining\" or \"restaurants\". Let me check the function's parameters again. The category is a string and required. So, perhaps the assistant can use \"any\" or \"all\" as the category. But the function's description says \"based on specified location, category, and other optional preferences.\" So maybe the category is a required parameter, and the assistant must provide it. Therefore, in this case, since the user didn't specify, the assistant might need to make an assumption. For example, if the user is looking for any restaurant, maybe the category can be left as a general term. However, the function requires it, so the assistant must include it. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should use a default value like \"restaurants\" as the category. Alternatively, maybe the category is not required, but according to the function definition, it is required. Therefore, the assistant must include it. So, in this case, the assistant will have to include a category. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the assistant can use a general term. Let's proceed with that. So, the parameters would be category: \"any\" (assuming that's allowed), location: \"New York, NY\", price_range: \"intermediate\", has_seating_outdoors: true. But the function's category parameter is required, so the assistant must provide a value. Therefore, the correct function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with category set to something. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant can use a default value. However, the function's parameters don't mention a default. Therefore, the assistant must include a category. Since the user's query is about finding restaurants in general, perhaps the category can be left as a general term. For example, maybe the category is \"restaurants\" or \"dining\". Let's proceed with \"restaurants\" as the category. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\nRestaurants_2_FindRestaurants(category=\"restaurants\", location=\"New York, NY\", price_range=\"intermediate\", has_seating_outdoors=True)"}

Since the user is asking to \"book,\" it sounds like they want to reserve a hotel, so Hotels_4_ReserveHotel might be the right choice. But wait, do they need to search first? The user didn't specify a hotel name, so maybe they need to search first. However, the Reserve function requires a place_name, which they don't have yet. So maybe I should first use Hotels_4_SearchHotel to find available options. But the user's message is a bit unclear. They might have intended to book directly, but without knowing the hotel name, that's not possible. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nFor Hotels_4_ReserveHotel, the required parameters are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, and location. The user provided the check-in date (July 15th) and stay length (5 days), but they didn't mention the location or the hotel name. So without the location, I can't proceed with the reservation. The user might have forgotten to provide the location. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to ask for more details. But according to the instructions, I should only return function calls if possible. Since the required parameters for reservation are missing (location and place_name), I can't call that function. Instead, maybe the user needs to search for hotels first. Let's look at Hotels_4_SearchHotel. It requires location, and optional parameters like star rating, smoking, and number of rooms. The user hasn't provided the location, so even that function can't be called without it. Therefore, the user's request is missing critical information: the location of the hotel. So I should point out that the location is required but not provided. Wait, but the user mentioned \"go to the studio sessions\"\u2014maybe the location is implied by the studio's location? But the user didn't specify that. Without knowing the city or location, I can't proceed. So the correct response is to indicate that the location parameter is missing, which is required for both search and reserve functions. Therefore, the user needs to provide the location to proceed."}

So for a roundtrip, you need both origin and destination, but departure and return dates are optional? That seems odd. Wait, maybe the function allows for one-way or roundtrip? No, the function is specifically for roundtrip. Wait, maybe the function can handle either if return_date is not specified? The description says if return_date is not specified, it defaults to null, which represents an open return date. But the user is asking for a roundtrip with specific dates. So in this case, both departure and return dates are needed. The user provided both, so I can fill those in.\n\nSo the parameters would be origin_airport: \"Atlanta, GA\", destination_airport: \"Boston, MA\", departure_date: \"2023-03-12\", return_date: \"2023-03-19\". The other parameters like seating_class, number_of_tickets, airlines are optional, so they can be omitted or set to 'dontcare' if needed. Since the user didn't specify, we can leave them out.

The user didn't specify any of these, so I should set them to default values. For star_rating, since it's not mentioned, maybe set to 'dontcare'. Smoking allowed isn't specified, so maybe leave it out or set to 'dontcare', but the parameter expects a boolean. Wait, the description says for number_of_rooms it can be 'dontcare', but smoking_allowed is a boolean. Since the user didn't mention smoking preferences, maybe omit that parameter. Similarly, star_rating can be set to 'dontcare'. So the function call would be Hotels_4_SearchHotel with location 'Sacramento, CA', star_rating 'dontcare', and leave smoking_allowed and number_of_rooms out since they are optional and not specified. Wait, the number_of_rooms in the search function is about the number to reserve, but the user is just searching, not reserving yet. So probably set that to 'dontcare' as well. Let me check the parameters again. For Hotels_4_SearchHotel, number_of_rooms is a parameter but required is false. The description says it's for the number to reserve, but since the user is searching, maybe they don't need to specify that yet. So maybe set it to 'dontcare' or omit. The function's number_of_rooms parameter allows 'dontcare' if no specific requirement. So including it as 'dontcare' makes sense. So the parameters would be location: 'Sacramento, CA', star_rating: 'dontcare', number_of_rooms: 'dontcare'. Smoking_allowed isn't specified, so we can omit it. So the function call is Hotels_4_SearchHotel(location='Sacramento, CA', star_rating='dontcare', number_of_rooms='dontcare'). Alternatively, since some parameters are optional, maybe just provide the location. Let me check the function's required parameters. The only required parameter is location. So the minimal call would be Hotels_4_SearchHotel(location='Sacramento, CA'). The other parameters can be omitted if not specified. The user didn't mention star rating or smoking preferences, so maybe it's better to just include the location. But the star_rating and number_of_rooms have defaults in the function? Wait, the function's parameters for star_rating and number_of_rooms are optional. So if they are not provided, the function might handle it. Therefore, the correct call is just with location. Let me confirm: the user's query is to search for a hotel in Sacramento, CA. They didn't specify any other criteria. So the function call should only include the location parameter.

Number of rooms is mentioned as two available, but the parameter description says it's for the number of rooms to reserve. However, the user is asking for availability of two rooms.

But wait, the parameters for LookupMusic include artist, album, genre, year. The user didn't mention an artist or genre, so those can be set to 'dontcare'. \n\nWait, the parameters for LookupMusic have 'artist', 'album', 'genre', and 'year'. The user wants songs from the album 'High Expectations' OR from 2019. But the function allows specifying multiple parameters. However, if I set both album and year, it would look for songs that are in that album AND from 2019. But the user's request is an OR. Hmm, that's a problem. The function might not support OR logic. So maybe I need to make two separate calls: one for the album and another for the year. But the user might want a single list. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle it by combining the parameters, but the function's description doesn't mention OR. So perhaps the best approach is to first look up songs from the album 'High Expectations' and if there are none, then look up songs from 2019. But since the user is asking for either, maybe the LookupMusic function can be called with album='High Expectations' and year='2019', but that would return songs that are both in that album and from 2019. However, if the album 'High Expectations' is from 2019, then that's correct. If not, then maybe the user wants either. But without knowing, perhaps the best is to use the LookupMusic function with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 2019. Alternatively, maybe the user wants two separate searches. But the function parameters don't allow for OR, so perhaps the assistant should first try to look up the album, and if that fails, then look up by year. But since the user is asking for either, maybe the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the system might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the LookupMusic function with album='High Expectations' and year='dontcare' and another call with album='dontcare' and year=2019. But the user might want a combined list. However, the assistant can only make one function call at a time. So perhaps the first step is to use LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and other parameters as 'dontcare', then if there are no results, proceed to look up by year. But since the user is asking for either, maybe the assistant should first check the album. So the correct function call here is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and the other parameters set to 'dontcare'. That way, it retrieves songs from that album. If there are none, then the next step would be to look up by year. But in the current turn, the assistant can only make one function call.

Since they mentioned booking, maybe they already have a house in mind. But probably, they need to search first. Wait, the user didn't mention specific details like the house name or ID, so I should start with a search.\n\nLooking at the functions available, there's Hotels_2_SearchHouse.

The other parameters like has_laundry_service or rating aren't specified, so I can leave them out. \n\nSo the first step is to call Hotels_2_SearchHouse with where_to=\"Austin, TX\" and number_of_adults=4.

However, the problem is that the booking function (Hotels_2_BookHouse) requires the check_in_date and check_out_date, which the user provided. But the booking function also needs the where_to parameter again. Wait, the where_to is already given as Austin, TX. So maybe the correct approach is to first search for houses, then book. But the user might not have specified that they need to search first. However, since they didn't provide a specific house ID or name, the assistant should first perform a search. \n\nTherefore, the first function call should be Hotels_2_SearchHouse with where_to=\"Austin, TX\" and number_of_adults=4. Once the search is done, the user can select a house from the results, and then the booking function can be called with the dates. But in the current turn, the user hasn't selected a specific house yet, so the assistant can only perform the search. The booking can't be done without knowing which house to book. So the correct first step is to search for available houses. The user's message says they need to book, but without prior search, the system can't proceed.

Let's assume the journey is on May 15, and the start time is the next day, which would be May 16. But that's not logical. Perhaps the user meant the journey starts on May 14, but the date is May 15. This is unclear. However, since the function requires date_of_journey and journey_start_time, and the user provided the date as May 15, I'll proceed with that date. The journey_start_time is required, but the user didn't specify. Maybe the user expects us to find available times, but the function for booking requires the start time. \n\nWait, maybe the user intended to book for the day before May 15, so the date_of_journey would be May 14. But the question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before.\" That's conflicting. Perhaps the user made a typo and meant the journey is on May 14. Alternatively, maybe the start time is the day before the journey date. For example, if the journey is on May 15, the start time could be 11 PM on May 14. But that's a stretch. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and assume that the journey_start_time is a specific time on that day. Since the user didn't provide the exact time, perhaps the function allows a default or the user expects to input it later. However, the function requires it, so without that parameter, the function can't be called. \n\nWait, the user might have intended to book for the journey starting on May 14, 2023 (one day before May 15). So the date_of_journey would be May 14, and the journey_start_time is on that day. But the user's question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before,\" which is confusing. \n\nThis is a problem. The function requires date_of_journey and journey_start_time. If the user's input is ambiguous, maybe I should point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to book for May 15, and the start time is the next day, which is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15, and the start time is the next day, but that's not feasible. Since the function requires both date and time, and the user hasn't provided the time, perhaps the correct approach is to call the function with the given parameters, but note that journey_start_time is missing. However, the function requires it, so the call can't be made without it. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"starting at one day before.\" Maybe they meant the journey starts one day before May 15, so the date_of_journey is May 14, 2023. Then the journey_start_time would be on May 14. But the user says \"for the journey on May 15,\" which is conflicting. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The user's request is unclear regarding the exact date and time. However, given the parameters required, I'll proceed with the assumption that the date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is a specific time on that day. Since the user didn't specify the time, perhaps the function allows a default, but the function requires it. Therefore, the function call can't be made without the journey_start_time. \n\nBut the user might have intended to book for the day before, so maybe the date_of_journey is May 14, 2023. Let's proceed with that. The journey_start_time would then be on May 14. However, the user's question states the journey is on May 15. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed to call the Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function with the parameters provided, using May 15 as the date_of_journey and assuming a placeholder for journey_start_time. However, since the user didn't specify the time, this might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to book for the day before, so the date_of_journey is May 14. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 15, and the start time is the next day, which is not possible. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide that information. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and optionally _class. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), date_of_journey (May 15, 2023), number_of_adults (4), _class (business), and trip_protection (true). The missing parameter is journey_start_time. Therefore, the function call cannot be made without that information. However, the user might have intended to book for the day before, so the date_of_journey would be May 14, but the question states May 15. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed to call the function with the given parameters, assuming that the journey_start_time is a placeholder. However, in reality, the function requires that parameter, so the call is incomplete. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the journey_start_time is missing. But since the user might have intended to provide that, perhaps I should proceed with the available parameters and note the missing one. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"starting at one day before.\" Maybe they mean the journey starts one day before May 15, so the date_of_journey is May 14, 2023. Then the journey_start_time would be on May 14. But the user's question says \"for the journey on May 15, 2023,\" which is conflicting. \n\nThis is a problem. The user's request is unclear. However, given the parameters required, I'll proceed to call the function with the available parameters, but note that journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function call cannot be completed as is. \n\nBut the user might have intended to book for May 15, and the start time is the next day, which is not possible. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide that information. \n\nIn conclusion, the function call requires journey_start_time, which is not provided. Therefore, the function cannot be called.

Since the user didn't specify expired tokens, maybe we should default to not including them. But maybe include_expired=True to be thorough? Wait, the user might need all tokens, including expired ones if they exist. But the function's include_expired is a boolean. The default isn't specified, but the parameter is optional. Hmm, the user is asking for all tokens, so maybe set include_expired=True to ensure all are retrieved.\n\nAnother function is get_shareable_api_tokens from CustomDashboardsApi. It also requires user_id and include_expired. The user might have both regular and shareable tokens, so maybe call both functions. But the user didn't specify shareable ones, but maybe it's better to check both. However, the user just said \"API tokens\", which could refer to the general ones. The get_api_tokens is more general, while get_shareable_api_tokens is specific to custom dashboards. Since the user didn't specify dashboards, maybe start with get_api_tokens first. But to be safe, maybe call both. However, the user might not need shareable ones. Let's check the first function first. If that's not enough, maybe the user can ask again with more details.\n\nSo the user's user_id is \"user123\". Let's call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True to get all possible tokens. That should cover the case where some tokens are expired and the user needs them. The post_api_token is for creating a new one, but the user is asking to retrieve existing tokens, so that's not needed here.\n\nSo the correct function calls would be get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True. Also, check if get_shareable_api_tokens is needed. Since the user didn't specify, maybe just the first one. But the user might have both. However, the user's question is general. Let's proceed with get_api_tokens first. If the response doesn't include shareable ones, maybe the user can ask again. But since the user is asking for all tokens, maybe call both functions. Wait, the functions are different. The first retrieves API tokens associated with the user's account, the second retrieves shareable ones for custom dashboards. If the user has both, they might need both. But the user didn't specify. Since the user is asking for all tokens, maybe call both functions. Let me check the parameters again. Both require user_id. So for thoroughness, call both functions with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True. That way, the user gets all possible tokens. So two function calls: get_api_tokens and get_shareable_api_tokens, both with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True."}

Wait, the function's enabled parameter is optional, so if not provided, maybe it defaults to false. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps we just include the required parameters.\n\nSo the required parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. The user provided name, threshold (5% as 0.05), and recipients. The alert_type is missing, but since it's an error rate, we can infer it's 'error_rate'. So the function call would include those parameters. The enabled parameter isn't required, so we can omit it. Therefore, the correct function call is create_global_application_alert_config with name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05, recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which requires user_id. The user provided that. This function retrieves shareable API tokens. But the description says \"shareable\" tokens, so maybe not all tokens?\n\nThen there's api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. Its parameters don't include user_id, but the desc says \"associated with the user's account.\" Since the user has provided their user ID, but this function doesn't take it, maybe it's implied that when called, it's for the authenticated user. But the user hasn't provided authentication here. Wait, the user might be authenticated already, but in the context of these functions, maybe the user_id is needed. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first function specifically requires user_id, which the user provided. The second function (get_api_tokens) doesn't take user_id, but maybe it's for the current user. However, the user is shouting they need all tokens, so maybe we need to use both functions? Or check which one gives all tokens.\n\nThe user might be expecting all tokens, including shareable ones. But the second function's parameters allow including expired tokens with include_expired. The user didn't specify expired, so maybe default is false. But to get all, maybe set include_expired=True? But the user didn't mention that. The first function's include_revoked is a separate parameter.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to call both functions to cover all possibilities. But the user's user ID is needed for the first function. Since the user provided their ID, use that. For the second function, maybe it's for the same user, but since it doesn't take user_id, perhaps it's assumed. However, without knowing the system's design, maybe the second function is for the currently authenticated user, which might be the case here. \n\nSo, to fulfill the user's request, call both functions: get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and get_api_tokens without parameters (assuming it's for the same user). But the user might need all tokens, so maybe set include_expired=True in get_api_tokens to ensure no tokens are missed. However, the user didn't specify expired, so maybe just use default parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, including revoked and expired. But the functions have separate flags for that. Since the user is urgent, perhaps include both parameters set to True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just use the functions as they are. \n\nIn conclusion, the best approach is to call both functions with the available parameters. For the first, use user_id=12345. For the second, maybe include_expired=True to get all possible tokens. But since the user didn't specify, maybe just call both with default parameters. However, the user might need all tokens, so including expired and revoked ones. Therefore, call get_shareable_api_tokens with include_revoked=True and get_api_tokens with include_expired=True."}

The user specified \"education\" and the university name, so that fits. The parameters for that function include \"experience_or_education_type\" which should be set to \"education\", and \"experience_or_education_name\" which would be \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\".\n\nAnother possible function is \"experiences_and_education\", but that seems more for listing all experiences and education, not specific details.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the set_alarm function. It requires an alarm_time parameter in a specific format. The user mentioned the date as \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Wait, \"tomorro\" is probably a typo for \"tomorrow\". But the date given is 2023-12-1. I need to confirm if that's the correct date. Assuming the user meant December 1, 2023, which is a valid date. The time is 7:00 AM. The function accepts time in 12-hour format with AM/PM, so \"7:00 AM\" is acceptable. Also, including the date would make it \"2023-12-01 7:00 AM\". Wait, the date format in the function's description allows 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM AM/PM' without the date. But if the user specifies a date, combining it with the time in 12-hour format should work. So the alarm_time parameter would be \"2023-12-01 07:00:00\" or \"2023-12-01 7:00 AM\". Let me check the function's parameter description again. The example includes '2023-06-01 09:30:00' and '9:30 AM'. So combining date and time with AM/PM is allowed. Therefore, the correct alarm_time would be \"2023-12-01 7:00 AM\". \n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, but the user mentioned it's for a meeting. So including the purpose as \"meeting\" would be helpful. \n\nNow, check if the date is correct. The user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". If today's date is before December 1, 2023, then that's valid. But if today is after that date, it's invalid. Since the current date isn't provided, I'll assume the user intended the correct date. \n\nSo the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time=\"2023-12-01 7:00 AM\" and purpose=\"meeting\". \n\nAnother possible function is set_countdown, but that's for a duration, not a specific time. So set_alarm is the right choice here."}
