The user is asking for the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds.

The formula should be s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Here, u is initial speed, a is acceleration, t is time.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters. It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and an optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. So I can use that function.\n\nI don't need to calculate final speed here because the question is about displacement. So the correct function to call is calculate_displacement with the given values. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe default to 2 decimal places as per the function's default."}

Its description says it fetches the selling price of a specified game in a particular platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: the game is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I should call store_price with these parameters. \n\nWait, the region parameter has a default of United States, but since the user specifically mentioned United States, I'll include it anyway. No harm in specifying it. \n\nI don't need to check if it's on sale because the store_price function should return the current price, whether it's on sale or not. The user wants the cheapest price, but maybe the function returns the current price directly. If there's a sale, it would already reflect the discounted price. \n\nSo the correct function call is video_games.store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States'. \n\nI don't see any other functions that would help here. The on_sale function checks if it's on sale, but the user wants the price. The store_currency might give the currency, but the question is about the price, not the currency.

The user is asking for the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the kinematic equations. Since it's starting from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance and time, and we need to find the final speed. But wait, maybe they want the acceleration first? Or maybe there's a direct way to find the final speed.\n\nWait, the functions provided are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check the parameters. The calculate_speed_from_rest function takes distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). So maybe that's the one to use here. The user's question is about finding how fast the object was going, which is the final speed. \n\nThe parameters given are distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial_speed=0 (since it starts from rest). So the function calculate_speed_from_rest should take these inputs. Let me check the function's description again. It says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a specified distance. So that's exactly the scenario here. \n\nTherefore, I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. Even though initial_speed is default 0, it's better to specify it explicitly here to avoid confusion. That should give the final speed. I don't think we need to calculate acceleration first because the function probably handles that internally using the kinematic equations. \n\nSo the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function. I don't need to calculate mass here because the question is about temperature mixing, not mass. The calculate_mass function isn't necessary here.

The parameters are elements (the list) and order (default 'asc'). Since the user specified ascending, I don't need to change the default. So I should call sort_list with elements as the provided list and order as 'asc' or just rely on the default. Since the default is already 'asc', maybe I can omit the order parameter.

Let me check the parameters again. The function expects elements and order (optional, default 'asc'). So the call can be written as sort_list(elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], order='asc') or without the order. But since the user explicitly said ascending, including it makes it clear. \n\nI don't need to use the other functions like filter_list or sum_elements because the task is about sorting, not filtering or summing.

The function requires desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The default for n_rolls is 1, but here we need two dice. Oh, wait, the n_rolls parameter might be the number of dice rolled. So if the user is rolling two dice, n_rolls should be 2. The desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die is 6 by default, which is standard for dice. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2). That should calculate the probability correctly. I don't need to specify sides_per_die since it's 6, which is the default. Let me confirm the function's parameters again. Yes, the default for sides_per_die is 6.
