The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user specified a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires the foodItem name. The parameters include newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I should set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The foodItem is \"Caesar salad\". No new ingredients are added, so newIngredients can be omitted. Special instructions might not be needed here, but maybe \"without anchovies\" could go there, but the parameter is for other instructions. So better to use removeIngredients.\n\nFor the drink: The user refers to order 123. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences are size (large), type (hot coffee), sweetness (regular), and milk (almond). So new_preferences should be a dictionary with these keys. The function expects a dict, so I'll structure it accordingly.\n\nCheck if all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll omit that. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome'. This will determine the predominant language, which might affect the Dockerfile and Kubernetes setup.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Using the same directory name as the repo. Wait, the parameter is the directory where the Dockerfile is created. So if the repo is cloned into 'nodejs-welcome', the directory_name here should be 'nodejs-welcome' as well. But the function's description says it's the directory within the repo. So maybe the directory_name is the path relative to the repo root. So if the repo is in 'nodejs-welcome', then the directory_name is '.' or the same name. Need to confirm. The function's param says \"the name of the repository directory where the Dockerfile will be created. The directory name should be a valid path relative to the root of the repository.\" So if the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be '.' or the repo's name. Let's assume the repo is cloned into a directory named 'nodejs-welcome', so the directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name, which is the same as the repo directory. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. The user didn't specify them, so we can use defaults. But the function's parameters have defaults for some, like deployment_name uses a default, image_name defaults to 'latest', replicas to 1, port to 80, service_type to 'ClusterIP'. So we can omit those unless specified. But the user's step 2.2 says to create Kubernetes yamls based on the analysis. The analysis might determine the image name or other parameters, but since we don't have that info yet, maybe we'll have to proceed with defaults.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. The commit_message and branch_name are optional. The user didn't specify, so maybe use a default message like 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs' and the current branch.\n\nWait, the steps mention adding all changed files to Git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function automatically git add all changes. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name and a commit message.\n\nSo the order is:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo to get the language (though the Dockerfile and YAMLs might not need that, but the step says to create them based on analysis. Maybe the analysis determines the base image or something. But since the functions don't take the language as a parameter, perhaps the analysis is just to confirm the language, but the actual creation uses defaults. Maybe the analysis is just a step, and the next steps proceed regardless. So even if the analysis is done, the Dockerfile and YAMLs are created with default settings. So the analysis might not affect the Dockerfile creation, but the user's instruction says to create them based on the analysis. Hmm, maybe the analysis is needed to determine the base image or other parameters. But since the functions don't have parameters for that, perhaps the analysis is just a step that's done, but the actual creation uses default values. So proceed with the functions as per the given parameters.\n\nSo the functions to call in order:\n\n- clone_repo with the given URL.\n- analyse_repo_contents with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n- create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' (and optional parameters if needed, but user didn't specify, so omit).\n- push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome' and a commit message.\n\nWait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is handled by push_git_changes_to_github, which automatically adds changes. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\")\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message=\"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes config\")\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to return only the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. So I need to make sure that the functions are called correctly. Let me check again.\n\nOkay, the user's question is to generate the function calls in the specified format. Let me proceed to the next step."}

Also, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are search_string, which would be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories set to true as per the user's request. So I'll call get_relevant_classes with those parameters.\n\nNext, the user wants the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. For that, the get_signature function is needed. I'll need to call this function twice, once for each method.

So two separate calls for each method.\n\nWait, but the user also mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class doesn't have that method, so the user might be trying to call it somewhere.

That's straightforward. I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format. The example formats are like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. So I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I can omit it or set a default. Since the function allows unit to be optional, I'll just provide the location.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\" without a comma. But the function's example includes the city and country with a comma. So I should make sure to format it correctly as 'Queenstown, Singapore' to match the required parameter format. \n\nSo, two function calls: one for the area and one for the weather.

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so I'll use that for the city.

But the first function is to search for a stylist, and the second is to book. So the user is providing the salon name directly, so maybe the first function isn't needed if they already know the name. Wait, the user's first request is to search for a stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and then book. But they mention 'Elegant Styles' as the salon. So perhaps the first function is to find providers in Sunnyvale, and then the second is to book. But the user might have already selected 'Elegant Styles' from the search results. However, the user is asking to both search and book. So we need to call both functions. Wait, but the user might not have found the salon yet. So first, find providers in Sunnyvale, then book. But the user is specifying the salon name directly. So maybe the first function is not necessary, but the user is asking to search and book. So perhaps the user wants to first search for stylists in Sunnyvale, and then book with one of them. But the user is giving the salon name, so maybe they already know it. But the question says to search and book. So perhaps the user wants to first search for stylists in Sunnyvale, and then book with 'Elegant Styles' if it's available. But the functions are separate. So the first function call is to find providers in Sunnyvale, CA, and the second is to book the appointment with 'Elegant Styles' at the given time and date. So both functions need to be called. Therefore, the answer should include both function calls."}
