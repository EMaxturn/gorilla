The user is asking for the cheapest selling price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on the PlayStation Store in the United States.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's video_games.on_sale, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which gets the selling price. The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But the question is about the cheapest, not just the price. However, the functions provided don't mention anything about finding the cheapest price. They just fetch the price. So maybe the user is assuming that the store_price function returns the price, but the question is about the cheapest. But since the functions don't have a way to find the minimum price, perhaps the answer is to call store_price and get the price, even if it's not the cheapest. Alternatively, maybe the store_price function returns the current price, and the user is asking for that. But the user's question is about the cheapest, which might not be the same as the current price. However, without additional functions, I have to use the available ones. So the correct approach is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region. The region is specified as United States, which is the default, so maybe it's optional. So the function call would be video_games.store_price with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', region 'United States'. That should get the current price. The user might not know that the function returns the price, but based on the given functions, that's the only way to get the price. So I'll proceed with that."}

The question is about calculating the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The parameters required are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (integer, default 0). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds.

The parameters required are 'elements' and 'order'. The elements are the list provided, and the order is 'asc' by default. Since the user asked for ascending order, which is the default, I don't need to specify the order parameter. \n\nSo the function call should be sort_list with elements as the list ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order as 'asc' even though it's default. But maybe the default is already 'asc', so maybe it's optional. However, the parameters require 'elements' and the order is optional with a default. But the user explicitly asked for ascending, so including it might be better to be explicit. Wait, the parameters say 'order' is required? No, the required field is just 'elements'.

The question is about veterans, which is a demographic category. The get_demographics function's description mentions retrieving demographic data including categories like gender, race, age. Veterans might be under a demographic category. \n\nThe parameters required for get_demographics are year and category. The user provided the year 1954, so that's covered. The category would need to be \"veterans\" or something similar. But I should check if \"veterans\" is a valid category. The function's example categories include gender, race, age, so maybe \"veterans\" is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_population function could be used, but population categories include things like total, veterans, women. Wait, the get_population function's category parameters include \"veterans\" as an example.

However, the get_population function's category \"veterans\" might also be a valid option. \n\nWait, the user's question is about veterans, which is a specific demographic group. The get_demographics function's category could be \"veterans\". So I should use get_demographics with year 1954 and category \"veterans\". \n\nAlternatively, if the get_population function's category \"veterans\" is available, that could also work.
