The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight line motion, so I should use the kinematics functions provided.\n\nLooking at the functions available, there's 'calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters required are all provided in the question: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, but the default is 2, so maybe I can include that or omit it. Since the user didn't specify, maybe just use the default. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for calculate_displacement have initial_speed as int, acceleration as int, time as int. The given values are all integers, so that's fine. So I should call calculate_displacement with those values. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_final_speed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct function is calculate_displacement with the given parameters. Let me make sure I have all the required parameters. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, time are all there. Rounding is optional, so I can leave it out or set it to 2. The user might want the answer rounded to two decimals, so including it would be better. \n\nSo the function call should be calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5, rounding=2. That should give the displacement. Let me check the formula to confirm. The formula for displacement when there's initial velocity and constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Plugging in the numbers: 20*5 + 0.5*10*25 = 100 + 125 = 225 meters. Rounded to two decimals, it's 225.00. So the function should return that. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to use calculate_displacement with the provided parameters."}

So I should call store_price with these parameters. The other functions like on_sale and store_currency don't seem relevant here. The store_price function should return the price, which would be the answer the user needs. No missing parameters here, so the function call is straightforward."}

Let me check the parameters for that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default=0). The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. Since it starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, which is the default. So I can use the calculate_speed_from_rest function with distance=20 and time=4. The function should compute the final speed. I don't need the acceleration function here because the question is about speed, not acceleration. Wait, the function's description says it calculates speed from rest with constant acceleration.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the colder one. But since they're the same gas, maybe it's a weighted average? Wait, the formula for final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same substance is (quantity1*temp1 + quantity2*temp2) divided by the total quantity. Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, the formula would be (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2). That makes sense because the total internal energy is conserved. Since internal energy for an ideal gas depends only on temperature and quantity, adding them together and dividing by total quantity gives the final temperature. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. Perfect. The parameters are all integers, which matches the given values. The user provided all necessary parameters: 2 moles, 300 K, 3 moles, 400 K. So I can directly call the calculate_final_temperature function with these values. \n\nNo need for the calculate_mass function here because the problem doesn't mention molar mass or require calculating mass.

Let me think about which function to use here. The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, and there's n_rolls and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the function's parameters have sides_per_die as an argument, but the default isn't mentioned. Wait, in the function definition, the parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls (default 1), and sides_per_die (default maybe 6? But the user didn't specify. However, the question just says \"rolling a sum of 7 on a roll of two dice.\" Typically, dice are six-sided unless stated otherwise. So I can assume sides_per_die is 6. \n\nSo the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. But wait, the function's parameters for sides_per_die don't have a default in the docstring. Wait, looking back: the function's args are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int, default 1), sides_per_die (int). Wait, the default for sides_per_die isn't specified in the function's args. Wait, the function's parameters are listed as:\n\nArgs:\n    desired_sum (int): The sum for which to calculate the probability.\n    n_rolls (int): Number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\n    sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die.\n\nWait, the default for sides_per_die isn't mentioned. So the user must provide it. But the question doesn't mention the number of sides. However, standard dice are 6-sided. So maybe the function assumes 6 if not provided? Or does it require it? The user's question doesn't specify, but since it's a standard problem, I think the function expects the user to provide sides_per_die as 6. So I need to include that parameter. \n\nSo the function call would be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. That should calculate the probability correctly. Let me check: for two six-sided dice, the number of ways to get 7 is 6 (1+6, 2+5, etc.), so the probability is 6/36 = 1/6. But the function will handle the calculation. So the correct function call includes all three parameters. The user didn't specify sides_per_die, but since it's necessary, I have to include it. So the answer is to call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6."}
