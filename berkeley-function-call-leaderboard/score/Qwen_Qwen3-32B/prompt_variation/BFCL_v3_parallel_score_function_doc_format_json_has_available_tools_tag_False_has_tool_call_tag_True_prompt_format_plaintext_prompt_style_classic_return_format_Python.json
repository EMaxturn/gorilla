The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers in a specific order. First, they want the HCF of 45 and 60. Then, use that result to find the HCF with 90 and 120. Then, do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, so the first step is to compute HCF(45, 60). Let me note that down. The function provided is math.hcf, which takes two integers. So I need to call math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60). Let me do that first.\n\nOnce I get the result of that, say it's H1, then I need to compute HCF of H1 with 90 and 120. Wait, the wording says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So it's HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120)? Or is it HCF of the three numbers? Wait, no, the HCF function here is for two numbers. So maybe the user wants the HCF of the first result with each of 90 and 120? Or perhaps the HCF of the first result and the HCF of 90 and 120? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe user says: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So after getting HCF(45,60) = H1, then find HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120)? Or maybe HCF of H1 with 90 and 120 as a pair? Wait, the pair is (90, 120), so perhaps the next step is to compute HCF(H1, HCF(90, 120))? Or is it HCF of H1 with each of 90 and 120? The wording isn't entirely clear. But given that the function takes two numbers, I think the user wants to first compute HCF(45,60) = H1, then compute HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120) separately. But the user might have intended to compute HCF of H1 with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120). Alternatively, maybe they want to compute HCF of H1 with the HCF of 90 and 120. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nThe user says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So \"with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\" implies that the pair is 90 and 120. So the next step is to compute HCF of H1 with 90 and 120. Wait, but the HCF function takes two numbers. So perhaps the user wants to compute HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120) separately. But the way the question is phrased, maybe they want to compute HCF of H1 with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120). Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of H1, 90, and 120, but the function can only take two at a time. So perhaps the correct approach is to first compute HCF(45,60) = H1, then compute HCF(H1, 90) = H2, then HCF(H2, 120). But the user's wording isn't clear. However, given the function's parameters, I can only process two numbers at a time. So perhaps the user wants to compute HCF of H1 with 90 and then with 120. But the question says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe the pair is 90 and 120, so the next step is to compute HCF(90, 120) and then HCF of that result with H1. Wait, that's another interpretation. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal instruction: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So first HCF(45,60) = H1. Then, use H1 to find HCF with the pair (90, 120). How? Maybe HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120). Or perhaps HCF(H1, HCF(90,120)). The user's intention is unclear. But given that the function is for two numbers, perhaps the user wants to compute HCF of H1 with each of 90 and 120. But the way the question is phrased, maybe they want to compute HCF of H1 with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120). Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of H1, 90, and 120, which would require multiple steps. Since the function can only take two numbers, perhaps the correct approach is to first compute HCF(45,60) = H1, then compute HCF(H1, 90) = H2, then HCF(H2, 120). But the user's wording isn't explicit. However, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed step by step as per the user's instruction.\n\nSimilarly, the second part is to find HCF(36,48) = H3, then use that result to find HCF with (72,96). Same logic applies here.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute HCF(45,60) \u2192 H1\n2. Compute HCF(H1, 90) \u2192 H2\n3. Compute HCF(H2, 120) \u2192 H3\n4. Compute HCF(36,48) \u2192 H4\n5. Compute HCF(H4, 72) \u2192 H5\n6. Compute HCF(H5, 96) \u2192 H6\n\nBut the user's question is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, I can only process two numbers at a time. So I'll proceed with the first step, which is to compute HCF(45,60). Then, use that result to compute HCF with 90 and 120. Similarly for the other pair.\n\nSo the first function call is math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60). Then, take the result and call math.hcf with 90 and 120. Wait, but the function requires two parameters each time. So after getting H1, the next step would be to compute HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120). But the user might want to compute HCF of H1 with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120).
