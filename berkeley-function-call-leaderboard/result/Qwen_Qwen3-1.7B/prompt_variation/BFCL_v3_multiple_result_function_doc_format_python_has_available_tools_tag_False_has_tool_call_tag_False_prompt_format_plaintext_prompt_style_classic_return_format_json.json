The other function is for final speed, which isn't needed here. So I need to call calculate_displacement with the given parameters. The parameters are all provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe default to 2 decimals. So the function call should include all three parameters. Let me check if the function requires any other parameters. The args are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user didn't mention rounding, so I can omit it or set it to 2. The function's default is 2, so maybe it's okay to leave it out. So the JSON call should be the function with those parameters."}

There's video_games.store_price, which fetches the selling price. But the question is about the cheapest price. However, the store_price function might just return the current price, not the cheapest. But maybe the function is designed to get the price, and the user wants the current price. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the cheapest, but the available functions don't include a function to find the cheapest. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the cheapest, but the functions provided don't have a way to find the cheapest. The store_price function gives the current price, but not the cheapest. So maybe the user's question can't be answered with the given functions. But maybe the store_price function is the one to use, and the user is expecting the current price. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, and the function can return the price, which is the cheapest. But the problem is that the function might not return the cheapest, but the current price. However, the user is asking for the cheapest, which might not be the same as the current price. But without a function to find the cheapest, we can only use the store_price function. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to call video_games.store_price with the game title, platform, and region. The user might not know that the function returns the current price, but that's the only available function. So the answer would be to call that function with the given parameters."}

The question is about acceleration, but the user wants the final speed. \n\nWait, the functions provided are kinematics.calculate_acceleration and kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest.

But the parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the speed, not the acceleration. However, the function calculate_speed_from_rest is designed to compute the speed given distance, time, and initial speed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So, if we call this function with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0, it should give the final speed. \n\nBut wait, the function's parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. The user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial_speed=0.

I think it's based on the principle that the final temperature is a weighted average of the initial temperatures, considering the amounts of each gas. The formula should be something like T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2), where n1 and n2 are the moles, and T1 and T2 are the temperatures.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature.
