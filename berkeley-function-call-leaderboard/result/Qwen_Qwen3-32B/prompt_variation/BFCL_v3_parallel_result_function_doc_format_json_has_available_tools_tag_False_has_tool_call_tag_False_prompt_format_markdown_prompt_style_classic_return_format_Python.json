The function provided is find_movie_showing, which requires location, movie, and time parameters. The location is San Diego, CA. The movies are Tenet and No Time To Die, which are in the enum, so that's good. The times are 5 pm and 7:30 pm. Wait, the parameters for time are an array of strings. So I need to structure the movies and times correctly.\n\nWait, the movie parameter is an array of strings from the enum, and time is an array of strings. But the user is asking for two different movies with different times. Does the function allow specifying different times for each movie? The parameters are structured as movie (array) and time (array), but it's not clear if each movie is paired with a specific time. The function's parameters might expect that each movie in the array is paired with the corresponding time in the time array. So for example, if there are two movies, there should be two times, each corresponding to their respective movie.\n\nIn the user's request, they want Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm. So the movies array would be [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"] and the times array would be [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]. That way, each movie is paired with its respective time. The location is San Diego, CA. So the function call should include all three parameters: location, movie, and time. Let me check the required parameters again. Yes, all three are required. So the correct function call would be find_movie_showing with location set to \"San Diego, CA\", movie as the list of the two movies, and time as the list of the two times. That should work."}

From the description, it calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of squares. For 2D points, it takes x and y parameters. The function also has an optional z parameter for 3D points, defaulting to 0 if not provided.\n\nFor the first two points, (3,4) and (6,8), these are 2D points. So I can use the math.hypot function by passing x and y. The third point is (9,12,15), which is 3D. The function's parameters include an optional z, so I can pass all three values there.\n\nWait, the parameters for math.hypot are x, y, and z (optional). So for the first two cases, I just need to pass x and y. For the third, pass x, y, and z. The required parameters are x and y, so z is optional. \n\nSo the first call would be math.hypot(x=3, y=4).

Then, do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, so the first step is to compute HCF(45, 60). Let me note that down. The function provided is math.hcf, which takes two integers. So I can call that function with number1=45 and number2=60. Let's do that first.\n\nOnce I have that result, say it's H1, then I need to compute HCF(H1, 90) and HCF(H1, 120)? Wait, no. Wait the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". Hmm, maybe it's HCF of the previous result and the new pair. Wait, no. The wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.\n\nOriginal instruction: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So first HCF(45,60) = let's say A. Then, find HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120)? Or is it HCF of (A, 90, 120)? But the function only takes two numbers. Wait, the function is HCF of two numbers. So maybe the user wants to take the result A and then compute HCF of A with 90, and then HCF of A with 120? Or perhaps HCF of (90, 120) and then combine with A? The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe it's HCF of the previous result (A) and the HCF of the new pair (90,120). So first compute A = HCF(45,60), then compute B = HCF(90,120), then compute HCF(A, B). But the user's wording isn't entirely clear. Alternatively, maybe they want to compute HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120) separately. But given the structure of the question, perhaps the intended approach is to compute HCF(45,60) = A, then compute HCF(A, HCF(90,120)). But the user's instruction isn't explicit. However, given the way the question is phrased, I'll proceed step by step as per the functions available.\n\nBut since the user is asking to use the result from the first HCF to find the HCF with another pair, perhaps it's HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120). But that would be two separate steps. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (A, 90, 120), but since the function only takes two numbers, that's not possible. So perhaps the user wants to compute HCF of A with 90, then take that result and compute HCF with 120. But the question isn't clear. However, given the way the question is structured, I'll proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, compute HCF(45,60) = A.\n\nThen compute HCF(A, 90) = B.\n\nThen compute HCF(B, 120) = C.\n\nSimilarly for the other part: compute HCF(36,48) = D.\n\nThen compute HCF(D, 72) = E.\n\nThen compute HCF(E, 96) = F.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96)\", which might mean HCF(D, 72) and HCF(D, 96). Again, ambiguous. But perhaps the user wants to compute HCF of the previous result with each number in the new pair. However, given the function's parameters, each HCF is between two numbers. So I'll need to make multiple function calls.\n\nBut the user's exact instruction is a bit unclear. However, given the way the question is phrased, I'll proceed step by step, making each required function call as per the instructions.\n\nSo first, the first part:\n\n1. Calculate HCF(45, 60) \u2192 call math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60)\n2. Use that result (let's say it's A) to find HCF with (90, 120). So perhaps compute HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120). But the user might want to compute HCF of A with the pair, which would require two separate calls. Alternatively, maybe compute HCF of 90 and 120 first, then HCF of that with A. But the user's wording is \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\", which could mean HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120). But since the function can only take two numbers, each of those would be separate calls.\n\nSimilarly for the second part:\n\n3. Calculate HCF(36, 48) \u2192 call math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48)\n4. Use that result (D) to find HCF with (72, 96) \u2192 HCF(D, 72) and HCF(D, 96).\n\nBut the user might want to compute HCF of D with 72 and 96, which would be two separate calls.\n\nSo the total function calls needed are:\n\nFirst part:\n- math.hcf(45,60)\n- math.hcf(result1, 90)\n- math.hcf(result1, 120)\n\nSecond part:\n- math.hcf(36,48)\n- math.hcf(result4, 72)\n- math.hcf(result4, 96)\n\nBut the user's instruction is a bit ambiguous. However, given the way the question is structured, I'll proceed with these function calls."}
