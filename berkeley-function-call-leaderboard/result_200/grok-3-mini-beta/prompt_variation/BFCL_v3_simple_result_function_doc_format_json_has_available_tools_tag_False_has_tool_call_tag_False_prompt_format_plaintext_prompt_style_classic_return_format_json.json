I need to identify if this fits.\n\nThe law of universal gravitation is from Newton's work, likely \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\".\n\nThe function requires 'author' and 'work_title'. The question provides the author as \"Isaac Newton\", but it doesn't explicitly give the work_title. I have to infer or use what's implied.\n\nThe question says: \"What year was the law of universal gravitation published by Isaac Newton?\"\n\nSo, I can treat \"Isaac Newton\" as the author, and \"the law of universal gravitation\" as part of the work_title. But is \"the law of universal gravitation\" the exact title? Probably not; it's a concept within a work.\n\nThe function description says: \"Title of the scientific work.\" So, I need a title like \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\".\n\nThe question doesn't specify the exact title. Does that mean the question lacks the required parameters?\n\nThe required parameters are 'author' and 'work_title'. I have 'author' from the question, but not 'work_title' explicitly.\n\nIn the instructions: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nI should point out if parameters are missing.

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I can't invoke it, I shouldn't respond with anything? No, it says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then it specifies to only return function calls.\n\nRe-reading: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nBut immediately after: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis is conflicting. The prompt says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret that if I can't make a call, I don't respond with anything, but the prompt doesn't explicitly say that.\n\nAt the end: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI think I need to make the function call if possible. For this, I can assume that \"the law of universal gravitation\" is the work_title, even if it's not exact, or perhaps use it as is.\n\nTo be precise, the function might expect the exact title. Since it's a tool, I'll go with what's provided.\n\nSo, for the function call:\n\n- author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n\n- work_title: \"the law of universal gravitation\" \u2013 but that might not be accurate. Perhaps I should use \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", but I'm not supposed to add information; I have to base it on the question.\n\nThe question doesn't specify the title clearly.
