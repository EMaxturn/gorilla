The provided function is requests.get, which sends a GET request to a URL with parameters. The URL should be the base path without query parameters, and the params are a dictionary.\n\nThe URL example given in the function is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

The function's params are a dict. I need to figure out the correct parameter names. Since the example isn't provided, but typical API parameters might include 'nodeId', 'podId', 'fabricName', or similar.

Wait, the original function's example URL includes 'flowrules/interfaceInfo', so perhaps the parameters expected are related to that. Maybe the API expects parameters like 'nodeId', 'podId', 'fabric', etc.\n\nAssuming that the API requires parameters such as 'nodeId', 'podId', and 'fabricName', I can structure the params accordingly. The user provided node ID 12, pod 10, and fabric Network1. So the params would be {'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'fabricName': 'Network1'}. But I need to make sure that the parameter names are correct.

The departure_date is March 16, 2024. The date format needs to be dd/mm/yyyy, so that would be 16/03/2024. The user mentioned \"around 14:00,\" so the departure_time can be 14:00 in 24-hour format.\n\nI need to check if all parameters are met. The date is after 14/03/2024 as required. The time is in the correct format. So, the function call should include these parameters. There's no ambiguity here; the user provided all necessary info. I'll format the function call accordingly."}
