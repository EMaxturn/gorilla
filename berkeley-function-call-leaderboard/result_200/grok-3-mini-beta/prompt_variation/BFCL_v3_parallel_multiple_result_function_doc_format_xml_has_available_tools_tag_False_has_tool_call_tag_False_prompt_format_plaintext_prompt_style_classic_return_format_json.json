Simple interest: $5000 invested for 5 years at 4% annual interest.\n\n2. Compound interest: $5000 invested for 5 years at 3.5% annual interest, compounded annually.\n\n3. Another compound interest: $3000 invested for 6 years at 5% annual interest, compounded twice a year.\n\nThe user specifies to use:\n\n- calc_Simple_Interest for the first option.\n\n- calc_Compound_Interest for the second option.\n\n- future_value for the third option.\n\nI have the available functions:\n\n- calc_Simple_Interest: Requires principle_amount, duration, annual_rate.\n\n- calc_Compound_Interest: Requires principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and optionally compound_freq.\n\n- future_value: Requires initial_investment, interest_rate, time, and optionally num_compoundings.\n\nFor each option, I need to map the parameters correctly.\n\nLet's break down each call:\n\n1. For the first option: Simple interest.\n\n   - Principle amount: 5000\n\n   - Duration: 5 years\n\n   - Annual rate: 4%\n\n   So, I can call: calc_Simple_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4.\n\n2. For the second option: Compound interest.\n\n   - Principle amount: 5000\n\n   - Duration: 5 years\n\n   - Annual rate: 3.5%\n\n   - Compounds annually, so compound_freq=1 (once per year)\n\n   So, call: calc_Compound_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1.\n\n3. For the third option: Using future_value.\n\n   - Initial investment: 3000\n\n   - Interest rate: 5% as a decimal? The function says \"as a decimal\", so 5% is 0.05.\n\n   - Time: 6 years\n\n   - Compounded twice a year, so num_compoundings=2\n\n   So, call: future_value with initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2.\n\nI need to make sure about the interest rate for future_value. The description says: \"The annual interest rate (as a decimal)\". Yes, so 5% is 0.05.\n\nThe user wants me to calculate all three, so I should make three separate function calls in one response, as per the format. The format allows for a list of function calls.\n\nThe response format is: ```json [array of function objects] ```\n\nI can include multiple functions in a single response array.\n\nMy response should only be that JSON array, nothing else.\n\nSo, I'll prepare an array with three objects:\n\n1. {\"function\": \"calc_Simple_Interest\", \"parameters\": {\"principle_amount\": 5000, \"duration\": 5, \"annual_rate\": 4}}\n\n2. {\"function\": \"calc_Compound_Interest\", \"parameters\": {\"principle_amount\": 5000, \"duration\": 5, \"annual_rate\": 3.5, \"compound_freq\": 1}}\n\n3. {\"function\": \"future_value\", \"parameters\": {\"initial_investment\": 3000, \"interest_rate\": 0.05, \"time\": 6, \"num_compoundings\": 2}}\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAfter these calls, the system will handle the results, and if needed, I might get another turn, but for now, this fulfills the user's request.\n\nI don't think I need to ask for more information; all parameters are provided."}

This matches \"recipe_search\". I can specify the ingredients and calories, and set meal to \"breakfast\".\n\n2. **Lunch at a restaurant**: This involves searching for restaurants with dishes containing chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, under 500 calories.

This directly matches \"ingredient_replace\".

They specify there are 4 favorable outcomes in a 52-card deck, and to round to 3 decimal places.\n\nI have functions that match these:\n\n- For modifying the painting: \"modify_painting\" function.\n\n  - Parameters: size (required), medium (required), dominant_color (optional).\n\n  - I have all the info: size=\"30x40\", medium=\"oil\", dominant_color=\"red\".\n\n- For predicting the evolutionary rate: \"prediction.evolution\" function.\n\n  - Parameters: species (required), years (required), model (optional, default 'Darwin').\n\n  - Species=\"African elephant\", years=100, model='Darwin'.\n\n- For calculating probability: \"calculate_probability\" function.\n\n  - Parameters: total_outcomes (required), favorable_outcomes (required), round_to (optional).\n\n  - Total outcomes=52 (for a hand? Wait, actually, for a royal flush, it's typically for a 5-card hand from 52 cards. The user says \"in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes\", which might imply total_outcomes is the number of possible 5-card hands, but they directly said 52, which is incorrect. Wait, no: they said \"in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\" But for probability, total_outcomes should be the total number of possible 5-card hands, which is C(52,5), not 52.\n\n  Wait, the user specified: \"In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\" This seems simplified. Typically, for poker, total_outcomes is the number of ways to draw 5 cards from 52, which is 2,598,960. Favorable is 4 (one for each suit).\n\n  But the function requires total_outcomes as an integer, and the user implied total_outcomes=52, which is wrong for this context. Wait, no, the user didn't explicitly say total_outcomes=52; they said \"in a deck of 52 cards\" and \"4 possible outcomes\". I need to infer.\n\n  Actually, looking closely: \"calculate the probability of getting a royal flush. In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes that result in a royal flush.\"\n\n  This is ambiguous. In standard probability, for a 5-card hand, total_outcomes = C(52,5) = 2,598,960, favorable=4.\n\n  But the user might be mistakenly thinking of something else. However, for the function, I need to provide what's required. The function's description is \"Calculate the probability of an event\" with total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes.\n\n  I should use: total_outcomes = total possible 5-card hands = 2,598,960, favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\n  The user didn't specify the hand size, but it's implied for poker. I need to make an assumption or use what's standard.\n\n  Wait, the user said: \"in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 possible outcomes\", which might mean they want total_outcomes=52 and favorable=4, but that would be incorrect for royal flush probability. As an AI, I should use the correct values to fulfill the request accurately.\n\n  To stick to the instructions, I have to use the function as is, and provide the parameters based on what's needed. The question lacks explicit parameters, but I can infer.\n\n  The system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, for the function call, I need to provide them.\n\n  For calculate_probability, I need total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user provided favorable_outcomes=4, and implied total_outcomes for a deck, but not correctly. I think I should calculate it properly.\n\n  Upon second thought, the user might mean for the entire deck, but that doesn't make sense. To proceed, I'll assume standard poker probability.\n\nI need to make function calls. The response should only be the JSON array of function calls.\n\nSince there are multiple tasks, I should call all the necessary functions in one go, as per: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, I'll prepare calls for:\n\n1. modify_painting with the given parameters.\n\n2. prediction.evolution with species, years, and model.\n\n3. calculate_probability with total_outcomes=2598960 (C(52,5)), favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nIs C(52,5) exactly 2,598,960? Yes.\n\nThe user didn't specify total_outcomes explicitly as 2,598,960; they said \"in a deck of 52 cards\". But to give the correct probability, I should use the right value.\n\nIf I use total_outcomes=52, the probability would be 4/52, which is not for a royal flush.\n\nI think it's safer to use the standard value.\n\nFinally, format: I need to output a JSON array of objects, each with \"function\" and \"parameters\".\n\nSo, something like:\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"modify_painting\", \"parameters\": {\"size\": \"30x40\", \"medium\": \"oil\", \"dominant_color\": \"red\"}},\n\n  {\"function\": \"prediction.evolution\", \"parameters\": {\"species\": \"African elephant\", \"years\": 100, \"model\": \"Darwin\"}},\n\n  {\"function\": \"calculate_probability\", \"parameters\": {\"total_outcomes\": 2598960, \"favorable_outcomes\": 4, \"round_to\": 3}}\n\n]\n\nThat seems appropriate."}
