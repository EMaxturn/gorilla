The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it retrieves the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size as an array. \n\nFor the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. So the size array would be [4,4]. For the second, museum_location is New York, material is bronze, size is 6x3, so [6,3]. \n\nBut the problem is, the user is asking for the average price of these two. However, the functions don't have a way to calculate an average. Each call would get the price of one sculpture. So I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each sculpture, then compute the average manually. But the functions don't handle averaging, so the system would have to do that after getting both prices. \n\nWait, but the functions can be called separately. So first call get_artwork_price for Philadelphia's marble statue, then for New York's bronze sculpture. Then take the two prices, add them, divide by two. But since the functions don't have an average function, the user would need to do that. However, the assistant's job is to make the function calls. So the answer would be two function calls, each for the respective sculpture. The average would be calculated by the user after receiving the prices. \n\nSo the correct approach is to invoke get_artwork_price twice with the respective parameters. Let me check the parameters again. The museum_location is required, material, and size array. Both sculptures have those parameters. So the function calls are possible. The user didn't mention any sculpture IDs, so get_sculpture_details isn't needed here. The answer should be two function calls."}

John has three investment options, and he wants to calculate the returns for each using specific functions. Let me break down each option one by one.\n\nFirst option: Simple interest with $5000, 4% annual rate over 5 years. The function needed here is calc_Simple_Interest. The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. All are provided: 5000, 5 years, 4%. So that's straightforward.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually over 5 years. The function calc_Compound_Interest is for this. Parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. The first three are given. The compound_freq is annually, which is once per year, so 1. But the parameter is optional, so maybe I should include it to be explicit.\n\nThird option: Initial investment of $3000 at 5% for 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function future_value is specified here. Its parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time (in years?), and num_compoundings. Wait, the time parameter in future_value is described as the number of time periods. But the problem says 6 years. However, the num_compoundings is twice a year, so the time periods would be 6 years * 2 = 12 periods? Or does the function handle it differently? Wait, the future_value function's time parameter is the number of time periods. But the interest rate is annual. Hmm, maybe the function expects time in years and num_compoundings as the number of times compounded per year. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nLooking at future_value's parameters: initial_investment (float), interest_rate (as a decimal), time (integer, number of time periods), num_compoundings (optional, integer). Wait, the description says \"the number of time periods the money is invested for.\" So if the time is in years and compounding is twice a year, then the time periods would be 6 years * 2 = 12 periods. But the interest rate is annual, so maybe the function uses the formula FV = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt), where n is num_compoundings. But the parameters for future_value have interest_rate as a decimal, time as the number of periods. Wait, maybe the time here is in years, and num_compoundings is the number of times compounded per year. Let me check the function's parameters again.\n\nWait, the future_value function's time parameter is described as \"the number of time periods the money is invested for.\" So if the investment is for 6 years and compounded twice a year, then the time periods would be 6 * 2 = 12. But the interest rate is annual, so the rate per period would be 5% / 2. However, the function's interest_rate parameter is the annual rate as a decimal. So maybe the function is designed to take the annual rate and the number of compoundings per year, and then compute accordingly. Wait, but the parameters for future_value are initial_investment, interest_rate (annual as decimal), time (number of periods?), and num_compoundings (times per period). Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think.\n\nIf the function is supposed to calculate FV with compounding, then the formula is FV = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt), where r is annual rate, n is compoundings per year, t is years. But in the function's parameters, time is the number of time periods. If the time is in years, then the num_compoundings would be per year. But the function's time parameter is the number of time periods. So if the investment is for 6 years, compounded twice a year, then time would be 6 years, and num_compoundings is 2. Wait, but the formula would need to multiply the time by the num_compoundings. Maybe the function's time is in years, and num_compoundings is the number of times compounded per year. Then the function would calculate it as (1 + (interest_rate / num_compoundings))^(num_compoundings * time). But the function's parameters are a bit unclear. However, the user specified that the third option should use the future_value function. So I need to map the given parameters to the function's parameters.\n\nThird option: initial_investment is $3000, annual rate 5% (so 0.05 as a decimal), time is 6 years, num_compoundings is 2 (twice a year). So the parameters for future_value would be initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2. That seems correct.\n\nSo for each of the three options, I need to call the respective functions with the correct parameters. Let me make sure all parameters are present and correct.\n\nFirst function call: calc_Simple_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4.\n\nSecond: calc_Compound_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1 (since it's compounded annually).\n\nThird: future_value with initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2.\n\nYes, that should cover all three options."}

The user has four separate requests here. First, they want the specific function of ATP in mitochondria. The cell_biology.function_lookup function seems right for that. I need to set molecule to \"ATP\", organelle to \"mitochondria\", and specific_function to true.\n\nNext, they want the driving distance from New York to LA in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function can handle that. Origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles, and unit should be \"miles\".\n\nThird, they're asking about the scientist credited with the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes the discovery name, so \"theory of relativity\" is the parameter here.\n\nLastly, the price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function requires brand, model, and finish. Brand is \"Fender\", model is \"Stratocaster\", finish is \"sunburst\".\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly specified and that each function is called in order. No parameters are missing, so all four functions should be called sequentially."}

The user has several tasks here. First, modifying a painting, then predicting an evolutionary rate, and finally calculating a probability.\n\nStarting with the painting modification. The original details are 24x36 inches, acrylic, dominant color blue. The user wants to change the size to 30x40, medium to oil, and dominant color to red. The function modify_painting requires size, medium, and dominant_color. All the necessary parameters are provided, so I can call that function with the new values.\n\nNext, predicting the evolutionary rate for African elephants over 100 years using the Darwin model. The function prediction.evolution needs species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, and model is Darwin. All required parameters are present, so that's doable.\n\nThen, the probability of a royal flush. The function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total is 52 cards, favorable is 4, and round to 3 decimals. Wait, but a royal flush is 4 possible hands (one for each suit), but the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5) which is 2,598,960. Oh, wait the user said total_outcomes is 52, but that's incorrect. However, the user's question states that there are 4 possible outcomes in a deck of 52. Maybe they're considering each royal flush as a single card? But that's not right. However, the user's instruction says to use the given parameters. The user says total_outcomes is 52, favorable is 4. So even if it's a mistake, the function call should use those numbers as provided. So I'll proceed with total_outcomes=52, favorable=4, round_to=3.\n\nSo three function calls: modify_painting, prediction.evolution, calculate_probability."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco. The details given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985, and location San Francisco. The function predict_house_price requires all these parameters, so I'll need to call that first.\n\nNext, they want to check lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. Since the user specified San Francisco county and California is the default state, I'll use that. So I'll call lawsuit_search with entity \"Mr. John Doe\", county \"San Francisco\", and state \"California\".\n\nThen, the probability calculation. The user mentioned total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function can handle that. So parameters total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. For the house price, all required fields are there. For lawsuits, entity and county are required, which are provided. The state is optional but specified. For probability, total and favorable are required, and round_to is optional but the user wants 3 decimals. So all three functions should be called."}
