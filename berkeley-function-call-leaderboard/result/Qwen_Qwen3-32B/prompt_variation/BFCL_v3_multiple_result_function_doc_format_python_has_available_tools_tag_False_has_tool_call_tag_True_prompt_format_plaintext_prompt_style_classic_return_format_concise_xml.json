The parameters required are initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, default is 2, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless they want a different decimal place. Since they didn't mention rounding, I'll stick with the default.\n\nSo the function call should be kinematics.calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. That should give the displacement. I don't see any missing parameters here. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed."}

The user specified the game title, platform, and region, so all required parameters are provided. The region is set to United States, which is the default for some functions, but here it's explicitly mentioned. \n\nI need to call the store_price function with the parameters game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', and region='United States'. The function should return the current price, which would be the cheapest if it's on sale. Wait, but the on_sale function checks if the game is on sale. However, the user is asking for the selling price, which might already account for any sales. So maybe just using store_price is sufficient. \n\nSince the user wants the cheapest price, and the store_price function should return the current price considering any ongoing sales. Therefore, I should call store_price with the given parameters."}

The user is asking for the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the kinematic equations. Since it's starting from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance and time, and we need to find the final speed. But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Do they want the final speed at the end of the 4 seconds, or the average speed during the 4 seconds? The wording says \"how fast an object was going\", which usually refers to instantaneous speed at the end. But let me check the functions available.\n\nLooking at the functions provided: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). So maybe this function can be used here. Let me check the parameters. The user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial_speed is 0 since it starts from rest. So the function calculate_speed_from_rest requires distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user's inputs fit into these parameters. So calling this function with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0 should give the final speed. Wait, but how does the function calculate it? If the acceleration is constant and starting from rest, the distance is (0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2). Then the final speed would be acceleration * time. Alternatively, maybe the function uses the formula v = 2d/t, but that's only if the average speed is d/t and since average speed under constant acceleration from rest is (initial + final)/2 = (0 + v)/2 = v/2. So d = average speed * time => d = (v/2)*t => v = 2d/t. So in this case, 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. But I need to make sure the function is using the correct formula. Since the function's name is calculate_speed_from_rest, it's likely using that formula. Therefore, using the function with the given parameters should give the correct answer. So the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. Wait, but the initial_speed parameter is an int with default 0. The user says the object started from rest, so initial_speed is 0, which is already the default. So maybe we can omit it. But the function's parameters require distance and time as integers. The user provided 20 and 4, which are integers, so that's okay. Therefore, the function call should be made with those values."}

Hmm, I remember that when gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function. I don't need to calculate mass here because the problem doesn't mention molar mass or require mass calculation. The answer should be the weighted average temperature based on the moles.

Oh, wait, no, maybe n_rolls is the number of times you roll the dice, but in this case, each die is rolled once. Wait, maybe the function is designed where n_rolls is the number of dice. Let me check the function description again. The description says \"Number of dice to be rolled.\" So yes, n_rolls is the number of dice. So for two dice, n_rolls is 2. The desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die is probably 6 since standard dice have 6 sides. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. That should calculate the probability correctly.
