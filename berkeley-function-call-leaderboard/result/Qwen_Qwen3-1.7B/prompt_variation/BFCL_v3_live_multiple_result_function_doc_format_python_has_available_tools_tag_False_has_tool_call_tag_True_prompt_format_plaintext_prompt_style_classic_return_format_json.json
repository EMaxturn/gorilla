The HNA_WQA.search is for web searches with a keyword, and the HNA_NEWS.search is for news articles. The user is asking for general information, not specifically news articles.

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account holder's name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name, account number, account type (checking), full name, and the starting and ending balances, as well as total deposits and withdrawals. However, the transaction_overview is a dictionary that includes totals and counts. The user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, but maybe they need the actual transaction details. Wait, the user mentioned \"other deposits totaling $7,132.76\" and \"withdrawals amounting to $5,927.40\". But the function's parameters for transaction_overview might need the actual transaction data, not just totals. However, the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details. The function's description says it's a summary, so maybe the transaction_overview is a parameter that can be filled with the totals. But the user might need the actual transactions, but since they didn't provide them, perhaps the function can use the totals. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_overview is a separate parameter that the user can provide. But in the user's question, they didn't list the actual transactions, just the totals. So maybe the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the provided details, including the totals and the account info. The user also wants a summary of transactions, which the transaction_summary.generate function might handle, but that requires the transactions list. Since the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, maybe the BankStatementOverView is the way to go, using the totals and the account details. The other functions like TransactionsV2 or Alltransactions might not be applicable here. The user is asking for an overview and a summary, so BankStatementOverView would provide the overview, and maybe transaction_summary.generate if the transactions are available. But since the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the main function to call with the given parameters. Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name, account number, account type, full name, and the transaction_overview would be the totals. But the transaction_overview is a dict, so maybe the user can provide the totals as a dictionary. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transaction details, just the totals. So perhaps the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is filled with the totals. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the function to use the provided balances and the totals to compute the summary. But the function's description says it's for an overview, which includes the summary. So I think the correct approach is to call BankStatementOverView with the provided details, including the transaction_overview as the totals. The user also wants a summary of transactions, which might be part of the overview. So the function call would include the bank name, account number, account type, full name, and the transaction_overview with the totals. The other parameters like starting_date and ending_date are not provided, but the user mentioned the statement period, which is October 1-31, 2019. However, the function's parameters for BankStatementOverView don't include starting_date and ending_date, but the user provided the period. Wait, the function's parameters for BankStatementOverView are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the account details, but the transaction_overview is a dictionary. The user mentioned the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals, but the transaction_overview might need the actual transaction data. Since the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, maybe the function can be called with the totals and the account info. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\n{\n  \"bank_name\": \"U.S. Bank\",\n  \"account_number\": \"1-523-1713-5704\",\n  \"account_type\": \"checking\",\n  \"full_name\": \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\",\n  \"transaction_overview\": {\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40,\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37\n  }\n}\n\nBut the user might need the actual transaction details, but since they aren't provided, this is the best possible approach. The transaction_summary.generate function requires the transactions list, which the user hasn't provided. So the answer would involve calling BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and then maybe another function if needed, but the user might expect the overview and summary to be in the same call. However, the functions are separate. So the main function to call is BankStatementOverView with the provided details, and the transaction_summary.generate might not be needed unless the user provides the transactions. Since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the answer would be to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters."}

The get_show_times function needs city, movie_name, movie_date, cinema_hall, movie_language, and movie_format. \n\nThe user's question is about movies playing today in Noida. They didn't mention a specific cinema hall or movie title, so maybe the get_movies function is more appropriate here.

The get_movies function's description says it retrieves a list of movies in a city, cinema hall, and date. So if the user doesn't specify a cinema hall, maybe the default is empty, but the function requires it. However, the user didn't mention a cinema hall, so maybe we need to check if it's required.\n\nLooking at the function parameters: the get_movies function has cinema_hall as a parameter with a default of empty string. So if the user doesn't provide it, it can be left blank. But the user is asking about Noida, so the city is Noida. The movie_date is today, which the system is supposed to calculate as Nov 4, 2024. The user didn't specify language or format, so default values can be used.\n\nSo, the function call would be get_movies with city=Noida, movie_date=24 Nov (since today is Nov 4, 2024, but the format is DD MMM, so 04 Nov). Wait, the user said \"today\" but the system is to use the current date, which is Nov 4, 2024. So the movie_date should be '04 Nov'?\n\nBut the user might not know the exact date, but the system is supposed to use the current date. So the function needs the movie_date parameter. The user didn't specify, but the system should use the current date.

But the cinema_hall is not provided, so it's optional. The function's parameters have a default for cinema_hall as empty string. So the call would be get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date='04 Nov').\n\nBut wait, the user might not have specified a cinema hall, so maybe the function can be called without it. However, the function's parameters require it? Let me check the function definition again. The get_movies function's parameters include cinema_hall with a default of empty string. So if the user doesn't provide it, it's okay. So the function call would be get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date='04 Nov'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to know the show times, but the question is about the movies themselves.

The parameters required are project_name, include_financials (which is optional), and date_format (also optional). The user provided the project name 'e-commerce-web', so I need to call this function with that name. They didn't mention including financials or changing the date format, so those can be omitted.

The other parameters are include_tools and as_of_date, but the user didn't specify any particular date. The default for include_tools is False, but the user didn't mention whether they want tools included. Since the question is about the tech stack, which includes tools, maybe we should include them.

But the user might want the default. Wait, the function's parameters have include_tools as default False. So if we don't provide it, it will be False. But the user might want the default. However, the question is about the tech stack, which includes tools. So maybe the user wants all technologies, including tools. But the function's default for include_tools is False.

But the function's default for include_tools is False. So maybe the user wants the default, which is False. But the question is about the tech stack, which includes tools. So maybe the user wants to include tools. But the function's default is False. So perhaps the user needs to specify include_tools as True. But the user didn't mention it. Wait, the user's question is \"What is the tech stack that employee (id Adriel) was working on\". The tech stack includes programming languages, frameworks, and tools. So the function get_tech_stack is the right one. The parameters are employee_id, include_tools (default False), and as_of_date (default current date). Since the user didn't specify any date, we can use the default. So the function call would be get_tech_stack with employee_id \"Adriel\" and include_tools as True? Wait, the default is False. If the user wants the tech stack, which includes tools, maybe we need to set include_tools to True. But the function's default is False. So if we don't specify include_tools, it will be False. But the user wants the tech stack, which includes tools. So maybe the user wants to include tools. Therefore, we should set include_tools to True. But the function's default is False. So the correct call would be to set include_tools to True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe we should assume that. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is False, and the user wants the default. But the question is about the tech stack, which includes tools. So perhaps the user wants to include tools. Therefore, the function call should include include_tools=True. But the user didn't mention it. Hmm. The function's parameters have include_tools as default False. So if the user doesn't specify, it's False. But the user is asking for the tech stack, which includes tools. So maybe the user wants to include tools. Therefore, we need to set include_tools=True.

Since the user wants the VEX, I think the download parameter should be false. But wait, the function's description says that if download is true, it forces the VEX to be downloaded as a file.

The required parameters are origin_airport, destination_airport, departure_date, return_date, seating_class, number_of_tickets, and airlines. The user hasn't specified seating class or airlines, so I'll use the defaults: seating_class is Economy and airlines is 'dontcare'.\n\nThe origin is Atlanta, GA, and the destination is Boston, MA. The departure date is March 12th, 2023, and the return date is a week later, which is March 19th, 2023. The number_of_tickets is default 1, which is fine. The airlines parameter is set to 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify any preference.\n\nI need to make sure the dates are correctly formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The departure_date is '2023-03-12' and return_date is '2023-03-19'. The other parameters are set to their default values. So the function call should include these parameters. There's no need to call any other functions like Flights_4_SearchOnewayFlight because the user is asking for a roundtrip. The Hotels_2_BookHouse function isn't needed here since the user is only asking about flights. The Travel_1_FindAttractions function is also not relevant here. So the only function to call is Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights with the specified parameters."}

There's Music_3_LookupMusic, which can find songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The parameters include album, which the user provided as 'The New Classic'. They also want tracks from six years ago, so the year parameter should be 2017. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"similar to those on the album\". The Music_3_LookupMusic function's description says it finds songs based on preferences, but the parameters don't mention anything about similarity to an album. The album parameter is there, but it's for finding songs in that album. However, the user wants songs similar to those on the album, which might mean they want songs from the same album or related albums. But the function doesn't have a parameter for similarity, so maybe the album parameter is used here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to find songs from the same album, so using the album parameter with 'The New Classic' would get those songs. Then, for the tracks from six years ago, set the year to 2017. \n\nBut the user also wants to explore tracks around six years ago. Since the current year is 2023, six years ago is 2017. So, the year parameter should be 2017. \n\nSo, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'The New Classic' and year set to 2017. But wait, the user wants similar songs to those on the album. The function's description says it finds songs based on preferences, but the album parameter is there. Maybe the user is expecting to get songs from the same album, so using the album parameter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to find songs similar to those on the album, but the function doesn't have a parameter for similarity. So perhaps the album parameter is used here. \n\nSo, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. Then, maybe another call to Music_3_LookupMusic with the same album but different parameters? But the user didn't specify other parameters. \n\nWait, the user wants to explore tracks around six years ago. So the year is 2017. So the second call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with year=2017. But the user also wants similar songs to the album. So maybe the first call is with album='The New Classic' and year=2017, and the second call is with the same album but maybe different parameters? Or perhaps the user wants to find songs from the same album and also from 2017. \n\nBut the functions can only be called once each. So the user's request is two parts: find songs similar to the album (so album parameter) and tracks from 2017. So two function calls: one with album and year, and another with year. \n\nWait, the user says \"find songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic' Additionally, I'd like to explore tracks released around six years ago. This year is 2023\". So the first part is to find songs similar to the album, which would be the album parameter. The second part is tracks from 2017. \n\nSo the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. The second call is Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017'. But the user might want both parts. However, the functions can be called multiple times. \n\nBut the user might want to find songs from the album and also from 2017. So the first call is for the album, and the second for the year. \n\nSo the answer would be two function calls: one with album and year, and another with year. \n\nBut the user's exact request is to find songs similar to the album and explore tracks from six years ago. So the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. The second call is Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017'. \n\nWait, but the user might want to find songs from the album and also from 2017. So the first call is for the album, and the second for the year. \n\nBut the functions can be called multiple times. So the correct approach is to make two separate calls. \n\nSo the final answer would be two TOOLCALL entries."}

But wait, the user hasn't specified the exact track title. They mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the style Hillbilly, but not the specific song. \n\nThe Music_3_PlayMedia function requires track, artist, device, and album. The user provided album but not the track or artist. The artist is Hillbilly style, but the function's artist parameter is a string. Maybe the user wants to filter by artist, but the function's default is 'any'. However, the user didn't specify the artist's name. \n\nWait, the user said \"Hillbilly style\" and \"album Gotta Be Me\". Maybe the track is part of that album. But without the exact track title, can I use the album name? The function's album parameter can be set to 'Gotta Be Me', but the track is needed. Since the user hasn't provided the track, maybe the function can't be called without that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to lookup songs in the Hillbilly style from 2019 on the album \"Gotta Be Me\". That would use Music_3_LookupMusic. The parameters would be genre='Hillbilly', album='Gotta Be Me', year='2019'. But the user didn't specify the genre as a filter, but they mentioned the style. The function's genre parameter is a string, so setting genre to 'Hillbilly' would work. \n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a song\", so maybe first they need to lookup the songs, then play one. However, the functions are separate. The user might want to play a song from that album. But without the track title, can't call PlayMedia. \n\nSo, the user's request is a bit ambiguous. They mentioned the album but not the track. The functions require track, artist, device, album. Since the track isn't provided, maybe the user expects to use the album name and genre. But the function's parameters require track. \n\nWait, the Music_3_LookupMusic function can return a list of songs, which could be used to select a track. But the user wants to play it immediately. So maybe first call LookupMusic to get the track, then play it. But the functions are separate. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track title, so maybe the answer is to use LookupMusic with genre and album, then assume the first result is the track to play. However, the functions don't have a way to select the first result. \n\nAlternatively, the user might not have the track title, so the answer is that the function can't be called without the track. But the user wants to hear a song, so maybe the assistant should use LookupMusic to find a song in the specified criteria and then play it. \n\nBut the problem is that the functions are separate. The user's request is to \"hear a song\" which could be either playing a specific track or finding a song. Since the user mentioned the album and style, maybe the LookupMusic is the way to go. \n\nSo, the parameters for LookupMusic would be genre='Hillbilly', album='Gotta Be Me', year='2019'. Then, once the list is retrieved, the user can choose a track to play. But the functions don't have a way to select the first result. \n\nBut the user might not have the track title, so the assistant can't call PlayMedia without it. Therefore, the correct approach is to call LookupMusic with the given parameters and then use the result to play the track. However, since the functions are separate, the assistant can only call the functions as they are. \n\nSo, the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre='Hillbilly', album='Gotta Be Me', year='2019'. Then, once the list is retrieved, the assistant can use the track name from the result to call PlayMedia. But since the assistant can only call functions in the current turn, it can't do that. \n\nTherefore, the assistant can only call LookupMusic with the given parameters. But the user wants to hear a song, so maybe the assistant should call PlayMedia with the album and genre, but without the track. \n\nWait, the Music_3_PlayMedia function's album parameter can be set to 'Gotta Be Me', and the genre can be set to 'Hillbilly', but the track is required. Since the user hasn't provided the track, the assistant can't call PlayMedia. \n\nSo, the answer is that the user needs to provide the track title. But the assistant has to make the best possible call. Since the user mentioned the album and style, maybe the assistant should use LookupMusic to find a song in those criteria and then play it. But the assistant can't do that in one function call. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters and then proceed to play the found track.

The user is asking about a global application alert, so the first function is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for create_global_application_alert_config: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, enabled. The user provided the name, threshold (5% which is 0.05 as a float), recipients, and the enabled default is True. The alert_type isn't specified, but the user mentioned an error rate. Maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' or something similar. But the function's parameters don't specify what the alert_type is. Wait, the description says \"the type of alert to be configured\" but the parameters don't list the possible types. However, the user didn't specify the alert type, so maybe it's assumed to be a generic type. But the threshold is given as 5%, which is a float.

The alert_type might be omitted since it's not specified, but the function's parameters don't require it. Wait, the function's parameters include alert_type as a required argument? Wait, looking back: the parameters for create_global_application_alert_config are name (str), alert_type (str), threshold (float), recipients (list), enabled (bool, default=True). So alert_type is a required parameter. But the user didn't specify it. Hmm, that's a problem. The user didn't mention the alert type, so maybe it's a mistake, or maybe it's assumed. But since the user didn't provide it, I can't include it. Wait, but the user's question says \"error rate threshold of 5%\", so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate'? But the function requires the alert_type as a parameter. So perhaps the user expects that the alert_type is set to 'error_rate' even though it's not provided. But the user didn't mention it, so maybe it's a missing parameter. However, the function's parameters require alert_type, so I need to include it. But the user didn't specify it. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the alert_type is not required? Let me check again. The function's parameters: alert_type is a str, but the default is not specified. Wait, the function's parameters are: name (str), alert_type (str), threshold (float), recipients (list), enabled (bool, default=True). So alert_type is a required parameter? No, because the default is not given. Wait, the function's parameters have alert_type as a required argument? Or is it optional? The description says \"the type of alert to be configured\" but the parameters don't specify if it's required. But in the function definition, the parameters are listed as name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, enabled. So alert_type is a required parameter. But the user didn't provide it. So this is a problem. How to handle this?\n\nWait, maybe the user intended to provide the alert_type as 'error_rate' even though it's not mentioned. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the function can't be called without it. However, the user's question is to set up the alert, so maybe the alert_type is assumed to be 'error_rate' by default. But the function's parameters don't have a default for alert_type. Wait, the function's parameters for create_global_application_alert_config have alert_type as a required parameter. So if the user didn't specify it, the function can't be called. But the user's question includes an error rate threshold, so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate'. Therefore, I need to include alert_type as 'error_rate' even though it's not mentioned. But the user didn't specify it. Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. However, since the user is asking to set up the alert, and the function requires alert_type, I have to include it. So I'll proceed with alert_type as 'error_rate' even though it's not mentioned in the user's question. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is not required, but the function's parameters don't have a default. Wait, the function's parameters for create_global_application_alert_config have alert_type as a str, but no default. So if the user doesn't provide it, the function can't be called. Therefore, the user's question is incomplete. But the user is asking to set up the alert, so perhaps the alert_type is 'error_rate' by default. But the function's parameters don't have a default. So this is a problem. However, the user's question includes an error rate threshold, so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' and the user expects that. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with name 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type 'error_rate', threshold 0.05, recipients ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], and enabled True. That's the only function needed here. The other functions are for mobile apps, which the user didn't mention. So the answer is to call create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters."}

The get_api_tokens function also takes user_id, include_expired, page, and page_size.\n\nThe user wants all tokens, so I should check which function can retrieve all. The get_api_tokens function's default page is 1 and page_size is 20, but if the user wants all, maybe they need to adjust the page and page_size. However, the problem is that the page_size is limited to 100 max. But the user might not care about the page size, just want all tokens.

Also, the include_expired is default False, but the user might want all tokens, including expired. Wait, the get_api_tokens function's include_expired is a parameter. If the user wants all tokens, including expired, then include_expired should be True. But the default is False. So maybe the user wants all, so set include_expired=True.\n\nAlternatively, the get_shareable_api_tokens function might have a different set of parameters. But the user's request is for all API tokens, so the get_api_tokens function is more appropriate. So the correct function to call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with user_id=12345, include_expired=True. But the user might not want expired tokens, but the question says \"all\" so maybe include_expired is True. However, the default for include_expired is False.

The user is asking for a reminder, so set_alarm seems appropriate. The parameters for set_alarm include alarm_time and purpose. The alarm_time needs to be in a specific format. The user provided the date as 2023-12-1 and the time as 7:00 AM. The function's example shows 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM AM/PM'. So, combining the date and time, the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00 AM'. The purpose is 'meeting' as specified.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is a typo. They probably meant tomorrow, which is 2023-12-01. So the date should be 2023-12-01. The time is 7:00 AM. So the alarm_time parameter would be '2023-12-01 07:00 AM'. The purpose is 'meeting'. \n\nThe set_alarm function's purpose is optional, defaulting to 'reminder', but the user specified 'meeting' as the purpose. So I should include that. \n\nI need to make sure the date is in the correct format. The example shows 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', so using '2023-12-01 07:00 AM' is correct. The function should accept that. \n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00 AM' and purpose as 'meeting'. \n\nI don't think set_countdown is needed here because the user is asking for a reminder, not a countdown. The countdown function is for durations like '1 hour 30 minutes', which isn't what the user wants. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is set_alarm with the specified parameters."}
