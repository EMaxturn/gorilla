So, I should call this function for each pair. \n\nLet me start with the first pair: 45 and 60. The HCF of 45 and 60. Let's see, factors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45. Factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. The common factors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The highest is 15. So HCF(45,60) is 15.\n\nNext pair is (90, 120). Let's calculate HCF. Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90. Factors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. Common factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. The highest is 30.

HCF of 15 and 30 is 15. \n\nSo the steps are: call math.hcf(45,60), math.hcf(90,120), math.hcf(36,48), then math.hcf(15,30). \n\nWait, but the user also mentions using the result of the first HCF with another pair. So after getting 15, then using that with (90,120) which gives 30. Then, find HCF of 15 and 30. \n\nSo the function calls would be three separate HCF calculations for each pair, and then one more for the combined result. \n\nI need to make sure that each function call is correctly formatted.

Let me check the functions available. There's the algebra.quadratic_roots function. It requires parameters a, b, and c. \n\nFirst equation: 3x\u00b2 +7x +2 =0. So a=3, b=7, c=2. The second equation is 5x\u00b2 -4x +1 =0, so a=5, b=-4, c=1. Both equations are provided, so I need to call the function twice with these parameters each time. I should make sure the parameters are integers as specified in the function. No missing parameters here. So two function calls should be sufficient."}

The user wants to find libraries in New York, LA, and Chicago. Each location has specific requirements: New York needs a Reading Room and Fiction section, LA needs Wi-Fi and Children, and Chicago needs a Cafe and Reading Room.\n\nFirst, I need to call the public_library.find_nearby function for each city. For New York, the parameters should be location \"New York, NY\" and facilities including \"Reading Room\" and \"Fiction\". Then for Los Angeles, location \"Los Angeles, CA\" and facilities \"Wi-Fi\" and \"Children\". Finally, Chicago with location \"Chicago, IL\" and facilities \"Cafe\" and \"Reading Room\". Each function call needs to specify the required parameters. I should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as lists. Let me check if all the required criteria are covered. Yes, each function call includes the necessary parameters. So three function calls should suffice."}
