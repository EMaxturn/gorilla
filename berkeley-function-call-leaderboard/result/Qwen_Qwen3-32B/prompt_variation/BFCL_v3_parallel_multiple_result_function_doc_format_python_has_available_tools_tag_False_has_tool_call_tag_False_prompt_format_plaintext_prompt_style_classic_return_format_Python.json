John has three investment options, and I need to calculate the returns for each using the given functions. Let me break down each option one by one.\n\nFirst option: simple interest. The parameters are $5000 principal, 5 years, 4% annual rate. The function provided is calc_Simple_Interest. The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate. So I can plug those values in directly. The formula for simple interest is principal * rate * time, so that should give the interest, and then add to principal for total amount. But the function might return the total future value or just the interest. Wait, the function's description says \"compute simple interest,\" which usually refers to just the interest earned. But sometimes people might use it to mean the total amount. Hmm. Let me check the function's name again. The future_value function is for future value, so maybe calc_Simple_Interest returns just the interest. But the user might expect the total amount. Wait, the problem says \"calculate the returns,\" which would be the total amount. So maybe I need to add the principal and the interest. But the functions provided might already handle that. Let me check the function definitions again.\n\nLooking at the functions: calc_Simple_Interest's docstring says \"Compute simple interest,\" which is likely the interest amount. Similarly, calc_Compound_Interest probably returns the interest, and future_value returns the total amount. Wait, the future_value function's description says \"calculates the future value,\" which is the total amount. So for the first option, using calc_Simple_Interest would give the interest, and then John would add that to the principal to get the total. But the user might want the total. However, the problem says to use the respective functions. The first option says to use calc_Simple_Interest. So maybe that function returns the total amount. Wait, no, simple interest formula is A = P(1 + rt), which is principal plus interest. But sometimes the function might just return the interest. Let me think. The function's name is calc_Simple_Interest, so it's possible that it returns the interest part. But the problem says \"calculate the returns,\" which is the total. Hmm. Maybe the user expects the total, but the function might return just the interest. But the user's instruction says to use the functions as given. So perhaps the functions are designed to return the total future value. Let me check the parameters again. For example, the future_value function is for future value, which is the total. The other two functions (calc_Simple_Interest and calc_Compound_Interest) might return the interest amount. But the problem says to use calc_Simple_Interest for the first option. So for the first option, the return would be the simple interest amount (just the interest), and then John would have to add it to the principal. But the user is asking for the returns, which is the total. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the functions are designed to return the total. Let me think again. The function names are \"calc_Simple_Interest\" and \"calc_Compound_Interest\", which usually refer to the interest earned, not the total. The future_value function is for the total. So for the first option, the user wants to calculate the total return, which would be principal plus simple interest. So the function calc_Simple_Interest would return the interest, and then we add it to the principal. But the user's instruction says to use the functions respectively. So maybe the first function call is to calc_Simple_Interest with the given parameters, and then the result is added to the principal. However, the problem says \"calculate the returns for each of these options using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So for the first option, the return is calculated using calc_Simple_Interest. If that function returns the interest, then the total would be principal + interest. But the user might expect the function to return the total. Alternatively, maybe the functions are designed to return the total. Let me check the parameters again. For example, the calc_Simple_Interest function's parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate. The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where r is the rate (as a decimal), t is time. So if the annual_rate is given as a percentage, then the function would need to convert it to a decimal. For example, 4% would be 0.04. So the function would calculate P * (1 + (annual_rate/100) * duration). So the function would return the total amount. Similarly, calc_Compound_Interest would return the total amount, using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where n is compound_freq. The future_value function uses the formula A = P*(1 + r)^t if compounded annually, but with num_compoundings. Wait, the future_value function's parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, num_compoundings. The formula is A = P*(1 + r/num_compoundings)^(num_compoundings * time). So for the third option, the initial amount is $3000, annual rate 5% (so 0.05 as a decimal), time 6 years, compounded twice a year (so num_compoundings=2). So the future_value function would calculate that correctly.\n\nSo for the first option, using calc_Simple_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4. The function would return 5000*(1 + (4/100)*5) = 5000*(1 + 0.2) = 5000*1.2 = 6000. So the total is $6000.\n\nSecond option: compound interest, annual rate 3.5%, compounded annually. So using calc_Compound_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1. The formula would be 5000*(1 + 3.5/100/1)^(1*5) = 5000*(1.035)^5. Let me compute that. 1.035^5 is approximately 1.187686, so 5000*1.187686 \u2248 5938.43. So the total is about $5938.43.\n\nThird option: initial investment $3000, annual rate 5% (so 0.05 as a decimal), time 6 years, compounded twice a year. So using future_value with initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2. The formula is 3000*(1 + 0.05/2)^(2*6) = 3000*(1.025)^12. 1.025^12 is approximately 1.344889, so 3000*1.344889 \u2248 4034.67. So the total is about $4034.67.\n\nNow, the user wants the function calls. Let's check each function's parameters.\n\nFirst option: calc_Simple_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4)\n\nSecond option: calc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1)\n\nThird option: future_value(initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2)\n\nWait, the annual rate for the third option is 5%, so as a decimal it's 0.05. The function future_value requires interest_rate as a decimal. So that's correct. The other functions (calc_Simple_Interest and calc_Compound_Interest) take annual_rate as a percentage (like 4, 3.5), which they would convert internally. The future_value function expects the rate as a decimal (0.05).\n\nSo the three function calls are as above. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly provided. For the third option, the initial_investment is 3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2. Yes. All parameters are present. The default for num_compoundings in future_value is 1, but here it's specified as 2, so that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be three function calls in order."}
