The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters required are all provided: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2 decimals. The user didn't specify rounding, so I'll use the default.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are integers as per the function's requirements. The function's parameters for calculate_displacement are integers. So initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. Rounding isn't specified, so it's optional. Therefore, the function call should be kinematics.calculate_displacement with those values. No other functions are needed here since displacement is the main request."}

The region has a default, but since the user provided it, I should include it. So I need to call store_price with those parameters. There's no need to check if it's on sale because the user wants the price, and the store_price function should return that. I don't see any other functions needed here.

They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). The required parameters are distance and time. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, which is the default. So I can use this function with distance=20 and time=4.\n\nWait, the other function is 'calculate_acceleration', but that requires initial and final speed and time, which we don't have here. So the correct function here is 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance 20 and time 4. The initial speed is 0 by default, so no need to specify it. That should give the final speed."}

Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability, the required ones are desired_sum and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a sum of 7, so desired_sum is 7. They didn't specify the number of sides on the dice, but typically dice have 6 sides. The function has a default for n_rolls, which is 1, but the user said \"two dice,\" so n_rolls should be 2. Wait, the parameters for the function include n_rolls as optional with a default of 1. So I need to set n_rolls=2, desired_sum=7, and sides_per_die=6. That should cover all the necessary parameters. Let me double-check: the required parameters are desired_sum and sides_per_die. The user didn't mention the number of sides, but assuming standard dice (6 sides) is reasonable. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6).

So the total gallons needed would be the area divided by the coverage rate. That's 360 divided by 400. Which equals 0.9 gallons.
