Since the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current selling price (which might be the standard price or the sale price if on sale), we can use that.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.on_sale` can check if the game is on sale, but it doesn't return the price. So to get the current price, we should use `video_games.store_price`.\n\nAlso, the question specifies:\n- game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n- platform: 'PlayStation'\n- region: 'United States'\n\nWe can directly call `video_games.store_price` with these parameters.\n\nHowever, note that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current selling price. Since the question asks for the \"cheapest\", and we are only getting the current price, we are assuming that the current price is the cheapest at this moment (which might be the case if it's on sale). But if the game has multiple editions (like standard, deluxe, etc.), we are not told which one. The question doesn't specify an edition, so we are to get the standard edition? But note: the function `video_games.store_price` requires the exact `game_title`. So we are using the exact title as given.\n\nBut wait: the question says \"the cheapest selling price\". There might be multiple editions of the same game (like standard, gold, ultimate) and the function `video_games.store_price` might require the exact title including the edition? The function description says \"the title of the video game\". So if we pass the base title, we might get the base game price. However, it's possible that the base game is the cheapest.\n\nAlternatively, we might need to consider that the function returns the price for the specific edition we are asking for. Since the question does not specify an edition, we assume the base game.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` only returns one price. So we are getting the price for the base game? How do we know which edition is the cheapest? This function does not support getting multiple editions. Therefore, we must assume that the user is asking for the base game.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to consider multiple editions, we would need to call the function for each edition? But we don't have a function to list editions. Therefore, we cannot get multiple editions.\n\nGiven the available functions, we can only get the price for the base game (by using the exact title as given). So we'll use:\n\n  game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n  platform: 'PlayStation'\n  region: 'United States'\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region of 'United States', so we can omit the region if we want. But to be explicit, we can include it.\n\nTherefore, we will call:\n  video_games.store_price with:\n    game_title: \"Assassins Creed Valhalla\"\n    platform: \"PlayStation\"\n    region: \"United States\"\n\nHowever, note that the function expects the region to be a string. We are providing it.\n\nBut wait: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price. We are not told what currency? But we know the region is United States, so the currency would be USD. Also, the function `video_games.store_currency` can get the currency for a platform and region, but we don't need it because the question only asks for the price (and in the US, we know it's USD). However, if we want to be complete, we could get the currency? But the question does not ask for the currency, just the price.\n\nTherefore, we only need to call `video_games.store_price`.\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest\". If the game is on sale, then the current price is the sale price (which is cheaper). If it's not on sale, then the current price is the standard price. So by getting the current price, we are getting the cheapest at this moment? But what if there are multiple stores? The function is for a specific platform (PlayStation Store). So we are getting the price in the PlayStation Store.\n\nTherefore, we are getting the current price in the PlayStation Store for the base game. We assume that the base game is the one the user is interested in.\n\nSo we make one function call.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.on_sale` is available. We could check if the game is on sale? But the question does not ask for the sale status, only the price. So we don't need to call it.\n\nTherefore, the function call we make is:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"game_title\" value=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"platform\" value=\"PlayStation\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"region\" value=\"United States\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>"}

We can provide just distance and time.\n\n The distance is 20 meters and time is 4 seconds. Both are integers, so we can use this function.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the kinematics.calculate_acceleration function to first find acceleration and then use it to find the final speed? But note that the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest is specifically for this scenario.\n\n However, let's look at the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest: \n   It says it calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest under constant acceleration over a specified distance and time.\n\n So we can use:\n   distance = 20 (integer)\n   time = 4 (integer)\n\n We don't need to provide initial_speed because the function description says it's for starting from rest, and the parameter is optional.\n\n But note: the function signature for kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest has two required parameters: distance and time.\n\n Therefore, we can call:\n   kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)\n\n However, note that the function expects integer types. Our values are integers, so that's okay.\n\n But wait: the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest does not specify which speed it returns (final speed, I assume). The description says \"calculates the speed of an object\" - in the context of starting from rest and having traveled a distance, it is the final speed.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the kinematics.calculate_acceleration function? But that function requires initial_speed, final_speed, and time (or distance). We don't have final_speed? Actually, we are trying to find the final speed.\n\n However, note that we have an alternative: we know that for an object starting from rest (initial_speed=0) and moving with constant acceleration, we can use:\n   distance = (initial_speed + final_speed) * time / 2\n   => 20 = (0 + final_speed) * 4 / 2\n   => 20 = final_speed * 2\n   => final_speed = 10 m/s\n\n But the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest is designed for this, so we can use it.\n\n Since the problem matches the function, we'll use kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\n However, note that the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest has the parameter initial_speed as optional. But if we don't provide it, it should assume rest (0). So we can omit it.\n\n But wait: the function description says \"that starts from rest\", so the initial_speed is assumed to be 0. So we don't need to pass initial_speed.\n\n Therefore, we call:\n   kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4)\n\n However, note that the function kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest expects integer for distance and time. We have integers, so it's safe.\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}

We don't have a list of acceptable art forms. \n   However, the example only says \"sculpture\". So we might have to use \"sculpture\" and then later filter for modern? But we don't have a function for that.\n\n   Since we are only allowed to use the provided functions, and we cannot filter by style, we must use the art_form as \"sculpture\". \n   Then, we rely on the fact that the function returns the most popular (which might include modern) and hope that the top rated one is modern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to get more specific by including the word \"modern\" in the art_form.
