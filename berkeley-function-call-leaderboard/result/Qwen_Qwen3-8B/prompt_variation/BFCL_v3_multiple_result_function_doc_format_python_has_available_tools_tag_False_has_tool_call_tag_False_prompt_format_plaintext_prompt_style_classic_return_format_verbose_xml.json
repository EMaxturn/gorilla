They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics functions provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for displacement when there's initial speed, acceleration, and time. The formula is displacement = initial_speed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. That's from the equations of motion. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters required are all provided in the question: initial_speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2 decimal places.\n\nSo I should call the calculate_displacement function with those values. Let me check the parameters again to make sure. Yes, all required parameters are present. No missing info. The function should handle the calculation. I don't need to use the other function since the question is about displacement, not final speed. Alright, that's all I need."}

The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the colder one. Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so it might cancel out.\n\nWait, the formula for the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same substance is (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. So (2*300 + 3*400)/(2+3). Let me check that. That would be (600 + 1200)/5 = 1800/5 = 360 K.

Let me think about which function to use here. The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, and there's n_rolls and sides_per_die. The user mentioned a roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the function's parameters have sides_per_die as an argument, but the default isn't mentioned. Wait, in the function definition, the parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls (default 1), and sides_per_die (default maybe 6? But the user didn't specify. However, the question just says \"rolling a sum of 7 on a roll of two dice\"\u2014standard dice are six-sided. So I can assume sides_per_die is 6. But does the function have a default for that? The function's args show sides_per_die as an argument, but the default isn't specified in the parameters. Wait, looking back at the function definition:\n\nThe function dice_roll_probability has args: desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int, default 1), sides_per_die (int). Wait, the default for n_rolls is 1, but sides_per_die's default isn't mentioned. Wait, in the function's parameters, the default for sides_per_die isn't specified. Wait, the user's question doesn't mention the number of sides. But standard dice are six-sided. So I need to include sides_per_die as 6. But does the function require it? The function's parameters list sides_per_die as an argument, but the user's question doesn't specify. However, the function might require it. So to calculate the probability correctly, I need to specify sides_per_die as 6. \n\nSo the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Therefore, the function call should include all three parameters. Let me check the function's parameters again. The function's args are desired_sum (required), n_rolls (default 1), and sides_per_die (no default mentioned). Wait, in the function definition, the parameters are written as:\n\nArgs:\n    desired_sum (int): The sum for which to calculate the probability.\n    n_rolls (int): Number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\n    sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die.\n\nWait, the default for n_rolls is 1, but sides_per_die doesn't have a default. So the user's question doesn't mention sides_per_die, but since it's required, I need to provide it. So in this case, the user is talking about standard dice, so sides_per_die is 6. Therefore, the function call should include desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. \n\nSo the correct function call is dice_roll_probability with those parameters. The other functions aren't relevant here. The user didn't mention coins or cards, so flip_coin_probability and shuffle_card_probability aren't needed. So the answer is to call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6."}
