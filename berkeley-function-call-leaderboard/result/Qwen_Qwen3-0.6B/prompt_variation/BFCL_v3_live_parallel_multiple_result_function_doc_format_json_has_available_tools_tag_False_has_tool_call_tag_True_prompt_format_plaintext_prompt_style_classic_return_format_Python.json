There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for changing drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I'll set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The newIngredients should be \"Caesar salad\" and the specialInstructions might be \"without anchovies\". \n\nThen, for the drink order, the user provided drink_id 123. The drink needs to be a large hot coffee. The ChaDri.change_drink function requires drink_id, new_preferences. The new_preferences should include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", and milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions might be optional here, so I'll leave it out unless specified. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The foodItem is \"Caesar salad\", newIngredients is \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients is \"anchovies\".

The 'get_relevant_classes' function seems relevant for finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True. The search string here would be 'CellResult' since they want classes related to it. Case sensitivity is default, so maybe leave it as is.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function requires 'class_name', 'method_name', and 'include_private'. The 'AbstractCellHandler' class is the parent, so the method names would be 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', but the functions provided don't have a method named 'getNumericValue'.

Since 5 cm is 0.05 meters, but the function's parameter is in units, maybe the size is in centimeters. Wait, the function's parameter is a float, so I can just use 5.0.

So the parameters would be event_type='Music', event_type='Theater', city='Los Angeles', date='2023-03-10'. Wait, but the user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", so maybe both event_type options are needed. But the function's parameters only take one at a time. So I should call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type set to 'Music' and 'Theater' and the city and date. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both types. Let me check the function's parameters again. The parameters for Events_3_FindEvents are event_type (enum ['Music', 'Theater']) and city. So the user wants either, so I need to call the function twice with each event type. But the user might want both. So the correct approach is to call the function once with event_type='Music' and city, and another with event_type='Theater' and city. But the user's question is about either, so maybe just one of them. Wait, the user wrote \"music concerts or theater plays\", which could mean either. So perhaps the function can handle both. But the parameters are event_type, so I need to set both event_type to 'Music' and 'Theater'. But the function's parameters are two separate parameters. So the correct way is to make two separate calls. Alternatively, maybe the function can be called once with both event types. But since the user is asking for either, I need to check if the function allows that. Since the function's parameters are event_type, which is an enum, and the user wants either, perhaps the function can be called once with both. But the user's question is ambiguous. However, the safest way is to call the function twice, once for each event type. So the answer would be two tool calls. But the user might expect a single call. Wait, the user's question is \"Find any music concerts or theater plays happening in Los Angeles on March 10th? this year is 2023\". So they want either, but maybe the function can handle both. So the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type='Music' and city, and another with event_type='Theater' and city. But the user might not need both. However, since the function's parameters are event_type, which is an enum, and the user wants either, perhaps the function can be called once with both. But the parameters are separate.
