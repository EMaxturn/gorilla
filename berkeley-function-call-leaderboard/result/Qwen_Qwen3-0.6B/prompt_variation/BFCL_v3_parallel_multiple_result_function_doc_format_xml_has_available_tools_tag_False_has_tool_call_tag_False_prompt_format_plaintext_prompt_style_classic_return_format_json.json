But the functions require parameters like museum_location, sculpture_id, or material and size.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, they want to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The glucose conversion efficiency is 10%, and the energy per mole is 2800 kJ. So, I need to use the biological.calc_energy function. The parameters here are mols (5 moles) and substance (C6H12O6). The default for joules per mole is 2800 kJ/mol, which matches the given value, so I don't need to specify it unless it's different. So the first function call should be biological.calc_energy with mols=5 and substance=C6H12O6.\n\nNext, calculate the biomass. The energy produced is from the previous step, and the efficiency is 10%. The biomass calculation would be energy divided by efficiency. So I need to use biological.calc_biomass with energy as the result from the first function and efficiency=0.10. That should give the biomass amount.\n\nThird, the machine needs to move 2 meters. The work done is force times distance. The energy provided by the bacteria is the work done. So the work is energy (from the first function) multiplied by the distance (2 meters). The physical.calc_work function requires energy and distance. So the third function call is physical.calc_work with energy and distance.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check again. For the first function, the parameters are mols and substance. For the second, energy and efficiency. For the third, energy and distance. All required parameters are present.

He's investing $3000, 5% annual rate, 6 years, compounded annually. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Since it's compounded annually, n=1.

They want three things: the number of all-time goals Cristiano Ronaldo scored for Manchester United in the Premier League, compare that with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition, and the top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nFirst, I need to find the functions that can help with each part. The user mentioned Manchester United, so I should use the player_stats function for Cristiano Ronaldo's goals. The player stats function requires player_name, team_name, and optionally competition. Since the user specified Manchester United, I'll set team_name to \"Manchester United\" and competition to \"Premier League\". That should get the goals.\n\nNext, comparing Cristiano Ronaldo's goals with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. Wait, the user says \"top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition\". But the player_stats function gives all goals for a team. So maybe I need another function. The top scorer function might not be directly available here. The user might need to check if there's a way to get the top scorer for the same competition. But looking at the functions provided, there's no function that directly gives the top scorer for a competition. The available functions are team_stats and league_stats, which are for team or league stats. So perhaps the top scorer is already in the player_stats data if we have the player's name and team. But the user is asking for the top scorer of Manchester United in the Premier League, which would be the same as Cristiano Ronaldo if he's the top scorer. But maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the user says \"top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition\". If the competition is Premier League, then the top scorer would be someone else. But the player_stats function might not have that info. Hmm, maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, perhaps the top scorer is already captured in the player's data. But without knowing the exact data, maybe I need to check if there's a function that can get the top scorer. But the available functions don't include a top scorer function. So maybe the user is asking for the top scorer of the same team in the same competition, which would be the same as the player's name if they are the top scorer. But if not, perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compare Cristiano Ronaldo's goals with the top scorer of the same team. But how to get that? Maybe the player_stats function can be used with team_name and competition to get all goals, and then compare with the top scorer. But the user hasn't provided the top scorer's name, so maybe that's not possible. Wait, the user's question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe user says: \"Can you tell me how many all-time goals Cristiano Ronaldo scored for Manchester United in the Premier League, then compare that with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition, and finally, tell me who was the top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season?\"\n\nSo first part: goals for Manchester United in Premier League. Second part: compare with top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. Third part: top scorer of Premier League in 2019-2020.\n\nSo first, get Cristiano Ronaldo's goals for Manchester United in Premier League. Then, find the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. Then, find the top scorer of Premier League in 2019-2020.\n\nTo get the top scorer of Manchester United in the Premier League, perhaps the player_stats function can be used with team_name and competition. But the user is asking for the top scorer, not all goals. So maybe the top scorer is already captured in the player's data. But if the player is Cristiano Ronaldo, and he's the top scorer, then the goals would be his total. But if not, maybe the function can return the top scorer. However, the user hasn't provided the top scorer's name, so perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken and the top scorer is already the player. But I need to proceed with the given functions.\n\nSo first function call: player_stats.get_all_time_goals with player_name \"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name \"Manchester United\", competition \"Premier League\".\n\nSecond, find the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. But how? Maybe the player_stats function can be used again, but perhaps the competition is already specified. Wait, the user is asking for the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. So maybe the competition is Premier League. So perhaps the top scorer is someone else. But without knowing that, maybe the user expects that the top scorer is the same as the player. But that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compare the goals with the top scorer. But how?\n\nThird part: top scorer of Premier League in 2019-2020. That would require a function like league_stats.get_top_scorer with league_name \"Premier League\" and season \"2019-2020\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call player_stats.get_all_time_goals with the parameters as above.\n\n2. Call league_stats.get_top_scorer with league_name \"Premier League\" and season \"2019-2020\".\n\n3. If the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition is someone else, perhaps that's not captured here. But the user is asking for that comparison. However, the functions provided don't include a function to get the top scorer of a team in a competition. So maybe the user is expecting that the top scorer is the same as the player. But that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the top scorer is already the player. But given the functions, perhaps the answer requires these three function calls.\n\nSo the final answer would be three function calls: one for all-time goals, one for the top scorer of the league, and one for the top scorer of the Premier League in the specified season."}

The painting modification parameters are correct, the evolutionary prediction is correct, and the probability calculation is correct. All required parameters are provided, so no missing info. Alright, that's all."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, and built in 1985. The function predict_house_price seems right for that. I'll need to call that function with area, rooms, year, and location.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state isn't specified. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nThen, the probability part: total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user specified the parameters, so I'll use those values.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For each function, check if they are required. The predict_house_price has all required parameters, lawsuit_search has entity and county, calculate_probability has both. So all three functions can be called. No missing parameters. So the final answer should include all three function calls."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems right here. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia, so I'll use those parameters.\n\nThen, the lawsuits details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided all these, so I'll call that function with those values.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability for 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All parameters are provided, so I'll use those.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted and that all required parameters are included. Let me check again each step to avoid mistakes."}
