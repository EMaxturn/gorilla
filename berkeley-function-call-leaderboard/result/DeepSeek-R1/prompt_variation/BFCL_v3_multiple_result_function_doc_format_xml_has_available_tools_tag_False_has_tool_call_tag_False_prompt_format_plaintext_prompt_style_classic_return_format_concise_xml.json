But the function doesn't specify edition. \n\n Looking at the function parameters for `video_games.store_price`:\n   - game_title: string (required)\n   - platform: string (required)\n   - region: string (optional, default United States)\n\n The function returns the price for that game. Since we are only given one region and one platform, and the function doesn't take edition as a parameter,\n we assume it returns the base game price or the standard edition? \n\n However, the question asks for the cheapest selling price. It's possible that the game might be on sale, so we should also check if it's on sale? \n But note: the `video_games.store_price` function should return the current selling price, which would include any sale.\n\n Since the question is only about the PlayStation Store in the US, we can call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But note: the function returns the price. We are not comparing across platforms or regions. So this one call should suffice.\n\n However, the question says \"cheapest\" but in the context of the same store? It might imply that we need to check multiple stores? \n But the question specifically says \"in the PlayStation Store in the United States\". So we are only looking at one store.\n\n But wait: the PlayStation Store in the United States is one store. So we are getting one price. \n\n However, it's possible that the same game has multiple listings (like standard, deluxe, etc.). The function doesn't specify which one. \n We don't have a function to list all editions. Therefore, we must assume that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the base game price? \n Or perhaps it returns the lowest price among the available editions? The function description doesn't say.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we can only use the function as provided. We'll call `video_games.store_price` for the given game, platform, and region.\n\n Since the region is provided (United States) and platform (PlayStation), we can make the call.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a parameter `region` that is optional and defaults to United States. So we can omit the region? \n However, to be explicit, we'll include it.\n\n However, the user's question is about the cheapest price. We are only making one call. We are not comparing multiple. \n But note: the function might return the base game price, and if there's a sale, that sale price would be the current price. \n So we are getting the current price for the base game? \n\n Alternatively, we could check if the game is on sale? But the `video_games.on_sale` function only returns a boolean. \n We don't need to check separately because the `store_price` should reflect the current price (sale or not).\n\n Therefore, we'll call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` is not needed because we are getting a price, and the currency is implied by the region? \n However, the question does not ask for the currency, only the price. So we don't need to call that.\n\n So the plan is to make one function call.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.store_price` might return the price in the local currency (which for US is USD). \n We are not asked for the currency, just the price.

We are given distance and time.\n\n We note that there are two functions available:\n\n 1. kinematics.calculate_acceleration: This requires initial_speed, final_speed, and time (with distance optional). But we don't have final_speed, so we cannot use this directly.\n\n 2. kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest: The description says: \"Calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest under a constant acceleration over a specified distance.\" \n    This function requires:\n        - distance (integer, required)\n        - time (integer, required)\n        - initial_speed (integer, optional) -> but since it starts from rest, we can set initial_speed to 0.\n\n However, note that the function name is \"calculate_speed_from_rest\", which implies it returns the speed (presumably the final speed) given the object starts from rest.\n\n The parameters for kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest are:\n    - distance: integer (required) -> 20 meters\n    - time: integer (required) -> 4 seconds\n    - initial_speed: integer (optional) -> we know it's 0, but since it's optional we can omit it? However, the function might assume rest (0) if not provided? \n\n But the problem states: \"started from rest\", so initial_speed is 0. The function description says it's for an object that starts from rest. \n\n However, let's check the parameters: the function has an optional parameter for initial_speed. We can set it to 0 to be explicit.\n\n But note: the function expects integers. The given values are 20 (meters) and 4 (seconds), which are integers.\n\n Therefore, we can call:\n   kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest(distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0)\n\n However, the function might assume initial_speed=0 if we don't provide it? Since the function is named for starting from rest. But to be safe, we can provide the initial_speed as 0.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says \"started from rest\", so if we omit initial_speed, the function might still work? But the specification says it's optional. We can try without? \n\n But note: the function might use the initial_speed if provided, and if not, default to 0? Since the function is for \"from rest\", it's safe to assume that if not provided, it will be 0. However, the problem states the object started from rest, so we have the value. \n\n Since the function expects integers and we have integers, we can provide all.\n\n However, the function expects the parameters to be integers. We have 20 and 4 as integers, and 0 as integer. So we can set:\n\n   distance = 20\n   time = 4\n   initial_speed = 0\n\n But note: the function's parameter for initial_speed is optional. We are allowed to omit it. However, to be explicit, we can include it.\n\n Alternatively, we might not need to include it because the function is designed for starting at rest. But the problem says the object started from rest, so either way.\n\n Let's decide: We'll call the function with distance and time, and also initial_speed=0 to be explicit.\n\n However, the function signature in the provided XML for kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest has:\n   <param name=\"initial_speed\" type=\"integer\" required=\"false\">\n\n So we can omit it? But the function might work without it? \n\n Since the function is named \"from_rest\", it's likely that if we omit initial_speed, it will be taken as 0.

This function should return the speed (final) after traveling the given distance and time starting from rest.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the first function? But we don't have the final speed? Actually, we are trying to find the final speed. So we cannot use the first function because it requires final_speed as an input.\n\n Therefore, the second function is the one to use.\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}

However, note that the function parameter \"art_form\" expects a string. We can use \"sculpture\" but the user specified \"modern sculpture\". \n   Since the function doesn't have a parameter for style (like modern), we might have to rely on the function's ability to interpret \"modern sculpture\" or use \"sculpture\" and then filter by rating (which might imply popularity and quality, including modern ones).\n   Alternatively, note that the function description says \"based on criteria like location, time, art form, and user ratings\". The art form is given as \"sculpture\", so we can use \"sculpture\" and then hope that the function considers the \"modern\" aspect in the ratings or by default? \n   But the function doesn't have a style parameter. Therefore, we must assume that the function will return sculpture exhibitions and we are relying on the \"user_ratings\" to be high so that we get top rated ones, which might include modern ones.\n\n - Month: The upcoming month. The function parameter \"month\" is optional and if not provided, it returns upcoming events. Since we want the upcoming month, we can omit the month or set it to the next month? \n   The description says: \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So we can omit it to get upcoming events, which should include the upcoming month.\n\n - User ratings: We want top rated, so we can set user_ratings to 'high'. The default is 'high', so if we don't set it, it will still use high. But to be explicit, we can set it to 'high'.\n\n However, note that the function returns the \"most popular\" exhibitions. The task says \"top rated\", which aligns with the user_ratings.\n\n Therefore, we can call the function with:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"   (since we don't have a separate style, and the function doesn't specify style, we use the art form as sculpture and hope that the function returns modern ones if they are top rated? \n   But note: the task says \"modern sculpture\". We don't have a way to specify \"modern\". \n\n Since the function doesn't have a parameter for style (like modern, contemporary, etc.), we cannot directly specify it. We must rely on the function's internal filtering or the fact that the top rated sculpture exhibitions in New York might be modern? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider that \"modern\" might be part of the art form? We can try \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form? The function doesn't specify that it must be a single word. Let's try passing \"modern sculpture\".\n\n Given the above, we'll set:\n   location = \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form = \"modern sculpture\"\n   month: omit (so it returns upcoming events, which includes the upcoming month)\n   user_ratings: set to \"high\" (though default is high, but to be explicit we can set it)\n\n However, note: the function might not recognize \"modern sculpture\" and might require a simpler form. But without knowing the exact implementation, we try to be as specific as the function allows.\n\n Alternatively, we might get no results and then have to adjust? But we are only allowed to call the function once per turn? \n\n But the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n However, we are only allowed to output function calls in the response. We cannot do multiple turns in one response? Actually, the instruction says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\n So in this turn, we can only call one function? Or multiple functions? The example format shows multiple function calls in one response. But in this case, we are only calling one function.\n\n Since we are not sure if \"modern sculpture\" is acceptable, and the function description says \"art form\" (which might be a category like painting, sculpture, etc.), we might have to stick to \"sculpture\". Then we can get the list and then perhaps filter by description? But we don't have a function to filter by style.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function with art_form as \"sculpture\" and then hope that the top rated ones in the upcoming month in New York that are returned are modern? \n\n Given the constraints, we decide to call the function with:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"   (because \"modern\" might be a style and not an art form, and the function might not support compound art forms)\n   month: omitted (so it returns upcoming events, which should include the upcoming month)\n   user_ratings: \"high\"\n\n But note: the user said \"modern sculpture\". We are not capturing \"modern\". \n\n However, there is another function: \"get_sculpture_info\" which retrieves artwork by a specified artist. But that doesn't help for exhibitions.\n\n So we must rely on the \"find_exhibition\" function.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use \"modern sculpture\" and if the function doesn't return anything, then we adjust in the next turn? But we are only allowed to output the function call in this turn.\n\n Since the problem doesn't specify the exact categories the function supports, we have to assume that \"sculpture\" is the art form and that the function might internally consider modern as a style. Or we might have to leave it to the function to interpret.\n\n We'll call the function with art_form as \"sculpture\" and then in the next turn if we get too broad results we can refine? But we cannot call again in the same turn.\n\n Alternatively, we can try both? But the instruction says we can output multiple function calls. However, they are independent. We can try two calls: one with \"sculpture\" and one with \"modern sculpture\"? But the function doesn't have a style parameter and we are using art_form for both.\n\n Let me re-read the function parameters: \n   <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\"> ... </param>\n\n It doesn't specify a fixed set of values, so we can try \"modern sculpture\". \n\n We decide to try with \"modern sculpture\". If the function is designed to handle such strings, then it might work. Otherwise, we might get an error or no results.\n\n So we'll make one function call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n But note: the function has an optional parameter \"month\". We are omitting it because we want the upcoming month (which is the default behavior).\n\n However, the user said \"upcoming month\", so we are safe.\n\n Let's write the function call in the required XML format.\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n    <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n    <param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">modern sculpture</param>\n    <param name=\"user_ratings\" type=\"string\">high</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the function also has an optional parameter \"month\". We are not including it because we want the default (upcoming events). So we skip it.\n\n However, the function requires two parameters: location and art_form. We are providing both. The other two are optional.\n\n Therefore, we output the above."}
