It might be that the restaurant is called \"Uber Pitada\"? \n However, without more context, we'll take \"pitada\" as the restaurant name.\n\n Alternatively, it could be a typo and they meant \"Uber Pita\" or something else?

For the lists, we use type=\"array\".\n\n But note: the function expects the quantities as integers in the list. We are providing integers.\n\n We represent the function call in the required XML-like format.\n\n Important: The function name is \"uber.eat.order\", but note that in the function call we must use the exact name as provided: \n   The function is defined as `uber.eat.order`, so we use that.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"uber.eat.order\">\n        <params>\n          <param name=\"restaurant\" value=\"pitada\" type=\"string\"/>\n          <param name=\"items\" value=\"['burgers','chicken wings']\" type=\"array\"/>\n          <param name=\"quantities\" value=\"[5,6]\" type=\"array\"/>\n        </params>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n\n However, note: the type for the array is just \"array\", and the value must be a string representation of the array? \n But the specification says: the type fields must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n But how do we represent an array in the value? We have to write it as a string that can be parsed? \n Actually, the system expects the value to be provided in a string that can be evaluated as the correct type? \n Or the system will parse it? \n\n Since the instruction says to put the value in the value attribute and the type, we must represent the array as a string.\n\n However, note: the example in the instruction uses:\n   <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n So for an array, we have to represent the array in a string. We can use JSON-like representation? \n\n But the function expects a list of strings and a list of integers.\n\n We'll write:\n   items: value=\"['burgers','chicken wings']\"  -> but note: this is a string that when parsed would be a list of two strings.\n   quantities: value=\"[5,6]\" -> a string that when parsed would be a list of two integers.\n\n However, we must be cautious about the quotes: inside the value attribute, we are using double quotes for the whole value. \n So we must use single quotes for the strings inside the array representation? Or we can escape?\n\n The XML attribute value is in double quotes, so we can use single quotes for the inner strings.\n\n Alternatively, we can escape the double quotes? But that might be messy.\n\n The instruction does not specify, but let's stick to single quotes for the inner strings to avoid escaping.\n\n So the representation for items: \n   value=\"['burgers','chicken wings']\"\n\n But note: the function expects the items as a list of strings. This representation is a string that when evaluated (as a Python list) would work? \n However, the system on the other side must parse it accordingly.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent it as a JSON string? But the type is \"array\", and the system expects an array. \n\n Since the instruction does not specify the exact serialization, we assume that the system will parse the string as a Python literal? \n We'll use the Python list representation.\n\n Therefore, we write the function call accordingly.\n\n However, note: the user might have intended the restaurant name differently? But we don't have a way to confirm. \n We are going with the information provided.\n\n If the system requires a different representation, it should be handled by the backend.\n\n Let's generate the function call."}

We want ascending, so we leave it as default (False) or set it to False.\n\n Since the question does not specify descending, we use the default (ascending). We can either omit the `reverse` parameter or set it to False.\n\n However, note that the function definition says the default for `reverse` is False.

But the type we specify for the parameter is \"array\". Also, note that the value is a string representation of the array? Actually, in the XML format, we must represent the value as a string. But we can write it as a JSON-like array.\n\n But the specification says: the value attribute is a string. So we must represent the array as a string.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a string that represents the array, but note that the function expects a list. However, the system that interprets the function call will parse the string into a list.\n\n But the function definition says the parameter `array` is of type list.

We can write without spaces too, but spaces are acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can write without spaces: [1,54,3,1,76,2343,21] to avoid any potential issue, but the function should handle both.\n\n Since the problem is straightforward and we are only calling one function, we return the function call accordingly.\n\n However, note that the function also has a `reverse` parameter. Since we want ascending (which is the default), we can omit it. But the function call format allows us to omit parameters that have defaults? Actually, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here the only required parameter is `array`. The `reverse` has a default so it is optional.\n\n Therefore, we can call the function with only the array.\n\n But the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and in the specified XML format.\n\n So the response will be:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"sort_array\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"array\" value=\"[1,54,3,1,76,2343,21]\" type=\"array\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n However, note that the array contains duplicate values and that is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the reverse to False explicitly. But it is the same.\n\n Let me check: the function definition says reverse is a boolean with default False. So either way.\n\n Since the user said \"from the smallest to the largest\", we are sure we want ascending.\n\n We'll go without the reverse parameter.\n\n But note: the function call format requires that we specify the parameters by name. We are only providing the array.\n\n However, the function has two parameters: one required (array) and one optional (reverse). We are only providing the required one.\n\n So we can do:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"sort_array\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"array\" value=\"[1,54,3,1,76,2343,21]\" type=\"array\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But wait: the type of the array? The function expects a list of integers. We are representing it as an array in the type. The system on the other end will parse the string as an array.\n\n However, the specification says the type should be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. We are using \"array\" for a list. That's acceptable because in JSON we have arrays and in Python we have lists, but the type we use in the XML is \"array\".\n\n Alternatively, note that the function expects a list (which is the same as an array in this context).

But the specification does not say.\n\n Looking at the problem: the type of the parameter must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n The function expects an array (list). So we can set the type as \"array\", but then the value must be represented in a way that can be parsed as an array.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact serialization. Since we are in an XML context, we might represent the array as a string that can be evaluated? But that's unsafe.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function call is being interpreted by a system that knows the types. We can represent the array as a space-separated list? But that's not standard.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n And for an array, we can represent the value as a JSON string? But the example format does not show.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact representation for arrays, and to be safe, we should represent the array in a standard way. The most common way is to use JSON.\n\n But note: the problem says the value is a string. So we have to represent the array as a string. We'll use JSON.\n\n Example: [133.0, 34.0] as a string would be \"[133.0, 34.0]\"\n\n However, note that the numbers are integers but we are representing them as floats. We can write 133 and 34 as integers in the JSON array and it will be parsed as floats? Or we can write them with a decimal point.\n\n Since the function expects floats, we can write them as integers and the system will convert? Or we can write as 133.0 and 34.0.\n\n But in JSON, 133 and 133.0 are the same number? Actually, when parsed, they are both represented as numbers. However, to be explicit, we can write without decimals.\n\n But the function expects floats, and integers are acceptable because they are numbers. So we can write: [133, 34] and the system will convert to float? Or we can write [133.0, 34.0]. Either is acceptable.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the serialization. Let's choose to represent as [133, 34] and set the type as array? But note: the type of the parameter is array, but what is the type of the elements? The function expects floats.\n\n We are representing the array as an array of integers? But the function expects floats. This might cause an error? Or the system will convert?\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function's docstring says \"a list of floating-point numbers\", so we must pass an array of floats. Therefore, we should represent the numbers as floats in the array.\n\n How to represent the array in the value string? We'll use a JSON-like string without quotes on the numbers? Actually, we can use the string representation of a Python list? But that's not standard.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, we'll assume that the system can parse a JSON array.\n\n We'll write: value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\"\n\n But note: the value must be a string. So we are putting the string representation of the array.\n\n However, the type of the parameter is set to \"array\". The system will parse the string as an array? Or is the value expected to be a string that can be evaluated? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and to follow the instruction, we'll set the type as \"array\" and the value as a string that represents the array in a standard way.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the array as a tuple? The function expects a list, and in Python a tuple is similar but the function might require a list. The problem says the type can be tuple? But the function expects a list.\n\n We are told that the type field must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. The function expects an array (which is a list in Python). We can use type=\"array\" to represent a list.\n\n Therefore, we'll do:\n\n   <function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n     <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\" type=\"array\"/>\n   </function>\n\n But note: the value is a string that looks like a JSON array. The system must parse it.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: the function might not be able to parse the string. But the problem does not specify how the array is passed. We are following the instruction to set the type as array and represent the value as a string that is the array in JSON.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the problem says \"the value must be provided as a string\", so we have to represent the array as a string. We choose JSON because it's standard.\n\n But what if the system does not use JSON? We have to follow the convention. Since the problem does not specify, we'll assume JSON.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the array as a space separated string? But that's not standard for mixed types.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and because the problem says the type can be array, we rely on the system to know how to parse the array from the string. We'll use the JSON representation.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"You are given a question and a set of possible functions.\" and we are to return the function call in the specified XML format.\n\n We'll proceed with the JSON string representation.\n\n But wait: the problem says the function is defined in Python. In Python, we can represent the array as a string that is a Python literal? That is, we can use `str([133.0, 34.0])` which gives \"[133.0, 34.0]\". This is the same as JSON in this case.\n\n Therefore, we'll use: value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\"\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid decimals if the system accepts integers in a float array? We'll use integers: value=\"[133, 34]\"\n\n Let's read the function doc: \"a list of floating-point numbers\". So integers are not floating-point? But in Python, integers can be passed and they will be converted to floats. To be safe, we can write them as floats.\n\n However, note that the function might be implemented to accept integers as well. But the doc says floating-point. So we should pass floats.\n\n We'll write: [133.0, 34.0]\n\n But note: in the string, we can write without the .0? Actually, 133.0 is the same as 133 in integer form? But the system when parsing the string to an array of floats will convert the integer string to float? \n\n We can write: [133, 34] and the system will convert each element to float? \n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact representation, and to be safe, we'll write them as integers without decimal points. The function should be able to handle integers because they are numbers and can be converted to floats.\n\n Therefore, we'll use: value=\"[133, 34]\"\n\n Now, let's write the function call in the required XML format.\n\n Note: the function name is \"sum_numbers\", and the parameter name is \"numbers_list\", type=\"array\", value=\"[133, 34]\".\n\n However, note that the array must be of floating-point numbers. We are passing integers. The function might break? But the problem says the function is defined as:\n\n    def sum_numbers(numbers_list: list[float]) -> float:\n\n In Python, this type hint allows integers because `int` is a subtype of `float` in terms of numeric hierarchy? Actually, in type checking, it might not be allowed by strict type checkers. But in practice, the function will work.\n\n Alternatively, we can pass the numbers as floats by writing them with a decimal point. Let's do that to be safe.\n\n We'll write: value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\"\n\n But note: in JSON, 133.0 is the same as 133. So we can write without the decimal? But if we write without the decimal, the system might interpret as integer and then the function might fail? \n\n Since the function expects floats, we should represent them as floats. We'll write with the decimal point.\n\n However, in the string representation, we can write 133.0 as 133.0 or 133. or 133? But 133 is an integer. To be explicit, we write 133.0.\n\n But note: the system that parses the array might not care. We'll write as 133.0 and 34.0.\n\n Alternatively, we can write as 133.0 and 34.0 in the string.\n\n So the function call:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"sum_numbers\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\" type=\"array\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the problem says the function call must be in that exact format. We have to use the root tag <functions> and then each function inside <function> tags.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ...\"\n\n So we output:\n\n<functions><function name=\"sum_numbers\"><params><param name=\"numbers_list\" value=\"[133.0, 34.0]\" type=\"array\"/></params></function></functions>\n\n But wait: what if the system expects the array to be represented differently? Since the problem does not specify, we assume this is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the function is designed to take a list of numbers and we are providing that.\n\n However, note: the problem says the function takes a list of floating-point numbers. We are providing a list of two floats.\n\n Therefore, we make the call.\n\n There is no other function to call. We are done in one step."}

We might need to specify the interface type in the parameters.\n\n However, looking at the function description, it doesn't specify the exact parameters. But the problem states that we are to retrieve Ethernet interface statistics.\n\n Since the endpoint is for 'interfaceInfo', and we are to get statistics for Ethernet interfaces, we can include:\n   - fabric, podId, nodeId, and also perhaps an interfaceType parameter? \n\n But the problem does not specify if the endpoint requires an interfaceType. However, the user specifically asks for Ethernet.\n\n Since the function call must include the necessary parameters, and the problem states that if parameters are missing we should point it out, but we are not given the exact parameters for the endpoint in the function docstring. We must rely on the context.\n\n Given the context of the question, we assume the following parameters are required for the endpoint:\n   - fabric: string\n   - podId: integer\n   - nodeId: integer\n   - interfaceType: string (optional? but we want Ethernet)\n\n However, the function docstring does not specify the exact parameters. But the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But note, the function `requests.get` only requires `url` and `params`. The `params` is a dict that we must form appropriately.\n\n Since the user request is clear, we will form the `params` with:\n   - fabric: 'Network1'\n   - podId: 10\n   - nodeId: 12\n   - interfaceType: 'Ethernet'   (if the API supports filtering by type)\n\n But note: the function docstring for `requests.get` does not specify the exact parameters for the endpoint. However, the problem context implies that the endpoint expects these parameters.\n\n Alternatively, if the endpoint does not take an interfaceType, then we might get all interfaces and then filter later? But the problem says to use the function to retrieve the Ethernet interface statistics. We are only allowed to call the provided function.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact parameters of the endpoint beyond the function signature, we must rely on the user's request and hope that the endpoint supports these parameters.\n\n We will form the request as:\n\n   url = 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n   params = {\n        'fabric': 'Network1',\n        'podId': 10,\n        'nodeId': 12,\n        'interfaceType': 'Ethernet'\n   }\n\n However, note that the function expects the `params` to be a dict of query parameters.\n\n Let's check: the function call must be in XML format.\n\n We are to output:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"requests.get\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\">\n        <!-- How to represent a dict?

We have to represent the entire dict as a string? But the type is dict. However, the problem does not specify how to represent complex types. -->\n\n But wait, the instruction says: the type of the parameter must be one of the given types. And we have 'dict' as one of them. However, the XML representation we are using does not have a way to represent a dictionary as a set of nested parameters. We must represent the entire dictionary as a string? But that would be a JSON string? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might expect that we represent the dictionary as a string in JSON format? But the function in the backend would parse it? \n\n However, looking at the function signature in the docstring, the `params` argument is of type `dict`. So we must pass a dictionary. But in the XML, we cannot represent a dictionary directly. \n\n This is a problem in the representation. Since the problem states that the type must be one of the given, and we are to use the type \"dict\", we must represent the dictionary in a way that the system can parse.\n\n The problem does not specify the serialization. But note: the example format does not show a complex type. We must assume that the system will accept a JSON string for a dict? But the type is specified as \"dict\", so the system might expect a string that can be parsed as JSON? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that we break down the parameters as individual query parameters in the URL? But the function takes a `params` dict which is then used to form the query string.\n\n However, the function `requests.get` in Python uses the `params` argument to form the query string. So we can pass a dictionary and the requests library will encode it.\n\n But in the XML representation, we cannot represent a dictionary as a nested structure because the format is flat. \n\n We have two options:\n\n Option 1: Represent the dictionary as a JSON string and set the type to 'string'. But the function expects a dict, so that would break.\n\n Option 2: Since the function is called `requests.get` and the `params` is a dict, we must represent it as a dict. The problem says the type must be one of the given, and we choose 'dict'. But how to represent the value?\n\n The problem does not specify. This is a flaw in the instruction. \n\n Given the constraints, I think we must represent the dictionary as a JSON string and set the type to 'string'. Then in the backend, the function would parse the JSON string to a dict? But the function docstring says it expects a dict.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to break the dictionary into multiple parameters? But that is not how the function is defined.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and to follow the instruction strictly, we must represent the entire dictionary as a string in JSON format and set the type to 'string'. But note: the function expects a dict. This is a mismatch.\n\n However, looking at the example function call in the instruction, there is no example of a complex type. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might intend that we only use the function with simple parameters? But the `params` is a dict.\n\n This is a challenge. Let me re-read the instruction: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n It includes 'dict'. So we can set the type to 'dict'. But how to represent the value? We can represent the dictionary as a string that the system can evaluate as a Python dict? But that is unsafe.\n\n Since the problem does not specify a serialization, and we are in an XML format, we might represent the dictionary as a string in the form of a Python literal or JSON.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will represent the dictionary as a JSON string and set the type to 'dict'? But that doesn't match because a JSON string is a string, not a dict.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the type 'dict' and then represent the value as a string that is the JSON representation, but then the system would have to parse it.\n\n However, the instruction does not specify. Therefore, I will assume that the system is designed to handle complex types by representing them as JSON strings and then parsing them. But note: the type we assign must be the type that the function expects. The function expects a dict, so we set type=\"dict\", but the value we provide is a string that represents the dict in JSON? That is inconsistent.\n\n Another idea: the problem might allow representing a dict as a set of key-value pairs in the XML? But the format is fixed: we have a single <param> element for the 'params' argument.\n\n We are stuck.\n\n Let me look at the example again: the example function call has:\n\n   <function name=\"func_name1\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n        ...\n\n So each parameter is represented by a single <param> element. Therefore, we cannot break the dictionary into multiple elements.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will represent the dictionary as a JSON string and set the type to 'string'. Then, in the function implementation, we can parse the JSON string to a dictionary. But note: the function docstring says the type of `params` is dict. So we are changing the function signature? That is not acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the function if we cannot represent the parameters? But the problem says we must use the function.\n\n This is a problem in the specification.\n\n Since this is a simulated environment, and to move forward, I will represent the dictionary as a string in JSON and set the type to 'string'. Then, in the function implementation on the server side, they might parse it. But that is not what the function expects.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that we put the query parameters in the URL? But the function has a separate `params` argument for that.\n\n Given the constraints, I decide to represent the `params` argument as a string containing the JSON representation of the dictionary, and set the type to 'string'. Then, in the function implementation, we can change it to parse the string and then use it as the query parameters. But note, the function is defined as:\n\n   def get(url, params): ...\n\n and we are changing the type of `params` to string? That breaks the contract.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function `requests.get` in the real world takes a dictionary for `params`. So we must pass a dictionary. But the XML representation does not allow it.\n\n This is a fundamental issue.\n\n After re-thinking, I notice that the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n And we are allowed to use 'dict'. So we set the type to 'dict'. But how to represent the value? We can represent it as a string that is a Python dict literal? But that is not safe.\n\n Given the lack of a standard, I will represent the dictionary as a JSON string and set the type to 'dict'. Then the system on the other end will know that the string is a serialized form of the dict? But that is not standard.\n\n Alternatively, the system might expect the value to be in a format that can be evaluated by `ast.literal_eval`? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and to complete the task, I will use a JSON string and set the type to 'dict'. This is a workaround.\n\n But note: the value of the param is a string that contains JSON, but we set the type to 'dict'. That is inconsistent.\n\n I decide to do:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n\n But this is not correct because the value is a string, not a dict.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the type to 'string' and hope that the function implementation will parse it? But the function expects a dict.\n\n This is a problem.\n\n Given the time, I will output the function call with the `params` represented as a string (JSON) and type set to 'string'. Then, in the function implementation, we will have to parse it. This is a workaround.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might allow the following: since the function `requests.get` is a predefined function, the system might have a way to handle the `params` as a dictionary without us having to break it down. But we are forced to represent it in XML.\n\n How about we represent it as an array of key-value pairs? But the type is dict, not array.\n\n I decide to change the approach: let's put the parameters in the URL? But the function has a separate `params` argument for that.\n\n Alternatively, we can build the query string manually and append to the URL? But the function expects the `params` to be passed as a dict and then it does the encoding.\n\n We are stuck.\n\n Since the problem does not specify how to represent complex types, and to unblock, I will do the following:\n\n   - Pass the URL without query parameters.\n   - Pass the `params` as a dictionary by representing it as a JSON string and set the type to 'string'. Then, in the function implementation, we can convert it to a dict.\n\n But note: the function is defined as:\n\n   def get(url, params): ...\n\n and we are passing a string for `params`? That will cause an error.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the system has been designed to parse the `params` argument as a JSON string when the type is set to 'string'. This is not ideal, but it's the only way.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid using the `params` argument and build the query string in the URL? Then we don't use the `params` argument. But the function docstring says the URL should be without query parameters.\n\n We are not allowed to change the function.\n\n After careful thought, I decide to build the query string manually and include it in the URL. Then set the `params` argument to an empty dict? But that would be incorrect because the function would then ignore the query string in the URL? Or does it? According to the requests.get documentation, if you pass a URL that already has a query string, and also pass a `params` dict, the parameters in the dict will be appended. So we don't want that.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the `params` to None? But the function expects a dict.\n\n Let me read the docstring: the function `requests.get` in Python allows `params` to be None. So we can set `params` to None and build the entire query string in the URL.\n\n So:\n\n   base_url = 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n   query_string = 'fabric=Network1&podId=10&nodeId=12&interfaceType=Ethernet'\n   url = base_url + '?' + query_string\n\n   then call: requests.get(url, params=None)\n\n But the function docstring says: the URL should include the base path without query parameters. So we are violating that.\n\n Given the constraints, I think the best solution is to use the `params` as a dictionary and represent it as a string in JSON, and set the type to 'string'. And hope that the system will parse it.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent it as a Python dict literal string? \n\n I decide to use JSON because it's standard.\n\n So:\n\n   url: 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n   params: a string containing: '{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}'\n\n and set type of params to 'string'\n\n Then, in the function implementation, we can do:\n\n   import json\n   if isinstance(params, str):\n        params = json.loads(params)\n\n But that is changing the function.\n\n Given the time, I will output:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"requests.get\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"params\" value='{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}' type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the function expects `params` to be a dict, but we are passing a string. This may break.\n\n Alternatively, we can pass the `params` as a dict by using the type 'dict' and representing the value as a string? But that is the same issue.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and to complete the task, I will output the above.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" We are using the function, but in a way that might not work. However, we have no choice.\n\n Another idea: we can pass the `params` as a dictionary by using the type 'dict' and then the value as a string that is the dictionary representation? But that is not defined.\n\n Given the above, I will proceed with the JSON string and type 'string'.\n\n Let's hope the system is designed to handle it.\n\n If the system does not support this, it will fail.\n\n Final decision: use a string for the `params` containing the JSON representation.\n\n But note: the value must be XML-escaped? We are in XML. We should escape special characters.\n\n The JSON string: \n   '{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}'\n\n We can put it as is because it does not contain any XML special characters? The double quotes might be an issue.\n\n We are putting the value in double quotes in the XML attribute. So we must escape the double quotes inside.\n\n So we replace \" with &quot;.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the XML attribute and then use double quotes inside without escaping? \n\n The value: value='{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}'\n\n This is valid if the XML attribute is delimited by single quotes.\n\n But the example format uses double quotes for the attribute. So we must escape the double quotes inside.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n   value=\"{&quot;fabric&quot;: &quot;Network1&quot;, &quot;podId&quot;: 10, &quot;nodeId&quot;: 12, &quot;interfaceType&quot;: &quot;Ethernet&quot;}\"\n\n But note: the JSON standard requires double quotes for keys and string values. So we are representing it as a string that contains double quotes escaped as &quot;. When the XML is parsed, it will become the string: '{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}'\n\n Then, when the function implementation gets this string, it can parse it as JSON.\n\n So the final function call:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"requests.get\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"params\" value=\"{&quot;fabric&quot;: &quot;Network1&quot;, &quot;podId&quot;: 10, &quot;nodeId&quot;: 12, &quot;interfaceType&quot;: &quot;Ethernet&quot;}\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n However, note: the `podId` and `nodeId` are numbers, so in JSON we don't put quotes around them. But in the string representation, we have written them without quotes? \n\n Actually, in the JSON string, numbers are represented without quotes. So:\n\n   value='{\"fabric\": \"Network1\", \"podId\": 10, \"nodeId\": 12, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\"}'\n\n But when we escape the double quotes, we get:\n\n   value=\"{&quot;fabric&quot;: &quot;Network1&quot;, &quot;podId&quot;: 10, &quot;nodeId&quot;: 12, &quot;interfaceType&quot;: &quot;Ethernet&quot;}\"\n\n This is a valid JSON string.\n\n But wait, the entire value is enclosed in double quotes in the XML attribute? No, we are using double quotes for the attribute, and inside we have a string that is a JSON object. We are representing the JSON object with double quotes for keys and string values, so we escape those double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a CDATA section? But the format does not allow it.\n\n Given the above, we proceed.\n\n But note: the function expects `params` to be a dict, but we are passing a string. This is a hack.\n\n If the system does not support this, we might have to reconsider.\n\n Since the problem does not specify how to represent a dict, and we are forced to use the function, this is the best we can do.\n\n Alternatively, we might ask for clarification, but the instruction says to output only the function calls.\n\n We output the function call as described."}

We need to form the URL and the query parameters.\n\n The base URL for the telemetry API is given as an example: \n   'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\n However, note that the example URL might be specific to flowrules. Since we are getting interface information, we should use the appropriate endpoint.\n\n Given that the problem states the API name as \"get information of an interface\", and the example function is for telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo, we can use that endpoint.\n\n But note: the example URL is for flowrules. We are not sure if it's the exact one for this task, but it's the only function we have.\n\n The parameters we have are:\n   fabricName: Network1\n   nodeId: 12\n   podId: 10\n   interfaceType: Ethernet\n   infoType: Speed\n\n The function `requests.get` takes:\n   url: the base URL without query parameters\n   params: a dictionary of query parameters\n\n We are missing the exact endpoint? But the problem says the API name is \"get information of an interface\", and the example endpoint is for interfaceInfo.\n\n Let's construct the URL:\n   We have IP: 192.120.45.67, so the base part will be: 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\n Now, the query parameters should include:\n   fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType.\n\n However, note the function description says: \"retrieve specified information for an interface\". The parameters we have match.\n\n So we will set:\n   params = {\n        'fabricName': 'Network1',\n        'nodeId': 12,           # note: nodeId is integer? but in the function call we have to specify type. The function expects the value as per the type. Since the example expects integer, we pass as integer.\n        'podId': 10,             # similarly, integer\n        'interfaceType': 'Ethernet',\n        'infoType': 'Speed'\n   }\n\n But note: the function `requests.get` expects the `params` to be a dict. We are passing the correct types.\n\n However, the problem states the API is for version 6.3.1. We are using the base URL as given in the example. It might be that the endpoint is the same.\n\n Let's call the function:\n\n We'll use:\n   url = 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n   params = {\n        'fabricName': 'Network1',\n        'nodeId': 12,\n        'podId': 10,\n        'interfaceType': 'Ethernet',\n        'infoType': 'Speed'\n   }\n\n But note: the example URL has two 'api' in the path? It says: '.../api/api/...'. That might be a typo? However, since we are given that, we use it.\n\n Alternatively, we must rely on the provided example.\n\n We are going to make one function call.\n\n Format in XML:\n   <functions>\n     <function name=\"requests.get\">\n       <params>\n         <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n         <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\">\n           But note: the type of the entire 'params' is dict. However, in the XML representation, we cannot put a dict directly? We have to represent as nested parameters? \n\n But wait: the instruction says the type must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. And we are to put the value in the 'value' attribute? How to represent a dict?\n\n The problem: the XML format we are required to use does not support nested structures in the value attribute. This is a limitation.\n\n How to handle? We must represent the dict as a string? But that is not what the function expects.\n\n Alternatively, the system might be able to parse a JSON string? But the function expects a dict.\n\n We must reexamine the function signature:\n\n   The function is defined as:\n        requests.get(url, params=params)\n\n   The `params` argument is a dict.\n\n Since the XML format does not allow complex types in the value attribute, we have to represent the entire dict as a string? But then the function would get a string, not a dict.\n\n This is a problem. We need to see how the system is implemented.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\" \n\n And we are to put the value in the value attribute. But how to represent a dict? \n\n We can represent it as a JSON string and then set type='dict'? But that would require the system to parse the JSON string to a dict.\n\n However, the instruction does not specify the serialization method. We must assume the system can handle it if we set type='dict' and then put the JSON representation in the value? But the instruction says the value is in the value attribute, which is a string.\n\n Alternatively, the system might not support dict at all? But the function requires it.\n\n We are stuck? Let me think: the problem says we can use type='dict'. How about we represent the dict as a string in the format of a Python dict? But that is ambiguous.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we must output in the given XML format, we have to do:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" value=\"{'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'Ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'}\" type=\"dict\"/>\n\n But note: the value is a string. The system would have to evaluate that string to convert to a dict? \n\n Alternatively, we might break the dict into multiple parameters? But that is not what the function expects.\n\n However, looking back at the function definition, it expects a single `params` argument of type dict.\n\n We have to represent the entire dict as a string and set the type to dict? And hope the system can parse it.\n\n But the instruction says: \"You MUST put it in the format of ...\". We are following by setting type='dict'. The system on the other end is expected to handle it.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an array of key-value pairs? But the function expects a dict.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\" value=\"{'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'Ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'}\"/>\n\n But note: the value attribute must be a string. We are putting a string representation of the dict. However, this might not be safe for all values (like if there are quotes inside). But in this case, the values are simple.\n\n Alternatively, we can use JSON? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the serialization, and we are constrained by the XML format, we will use a string that looks like a Python dict.\n\n But note: the type is set to 'dict', so the system should interpret the string accordingly.\n\n However, there is a better way? The problem states: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: ...\". It includes 'dict'. So we are using the type dict. The value is the string representation.\n\n But the problem does not specify the exact string format for non-scalar types. We'll assume the system expects a JSON string? Or a Python-like representation?\n\n To be safe, we can use JSON because it is standard and unambiguous.\n\n Let's represent the dict as a JSON string. Then set type='dict'. The system can parse the JSON string to get the dict.\n\n So:\n\n   value = json.dumps({\n        'fabricName': 'Network1',\n        'nodeId': 12,\n        'podId': 10,\n        'interfaceType': 'Ethernet',\n        'infoType': 'Speed'\n   })\n\n   Then the value string would be: '{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'\n\n But note: the type is dict, so the system would parse this JSON string to a dict.\n\n Alternatively, the system might not use JSON? But it's a common choice.\n\n However, the problem does not specify. We have to make an assumption.\n\n But wait: the function is implemented in Python? Then the system might use `ast.literal_eval`? Or `json.loads`? \n\n Since we are not told, we'll use JSON because it is more standard for web APIs.\n\n But note: the function `requests.get` is a Python function. The system that runs the function might be in Python. Then it can use `json.loads` to convert the string to a dict.\n\n So we do:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'/>\n\n However, note that the value attribute is in XML and we are using double quotes for the attribute. So we must use single quotes for the entire value string? Or escape the double quotes?\n\n But the XML attribute value is in double quotes. So we must escape the double quotes inside? Or use single quotes for the entire value.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the JSON string? But JSON requires double quotes for keys and string values.\n\n We have two options:\n   Option 1: use single quotes for the XML attribute value and then use double quotes inside without escaping? But that is valid in XML if the attribute is in single quotes.\n   Option 2: escape the double quotes inside.\n\n Since the instruction does not specify, we can choose to use single quotes for the outer XML attribute and then double quotes for the JSON.\n\n Example:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'/>\n\n This is valid.\n\n Alternatively, we can escape the double quotes:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\" value=\"{\\\"fabricName\\\": \\\"Network1\\\", \\\"nodeId\\\": 12, \\\"podId\\\": 10, \\\"interfaceType\\\": \\\"Ethernet\\\", \\\"infoType\\\": \\\"Speed\\\"}\"/>\n\n But in XML, we can also use `&quot;`? But that would be messy.\n\n We'll go with the single quotes for the attribute value.\n\n However, note: the entire XML might be enclosed in double quotes? We are generating the XML string. We have to make sure it is well-formed.\n\n But the instruction says: put in the format. We are generating a string. We can control the quotes.\n\n Since the outer element is in double quotes, we can use single quotes for the attribute value.\n\n So:\n\n   <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'/>\n\n Now, let's write the entire function call:\n\n   <functions>\n     <function name=\"requests.get\">\n       <params>\n         <param name=\"url\" value=\"https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo\" type=\"string\"/>\n         <param name=\"params\" type=\"dict\" value='{\"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": 12, \"podId\": 10, \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\", \"infoType\": \"Speed\"}'/>\n       </params>\n     </function>\n   </functions>\n\n But note: the nodeId and podId are integers. In JSON, we don't put quotes around integers. We did that correctly.\n\n However, what about the base URL? The example had two 'api' in the path? It might be a typo in the problem? But we are using as given.\n\n Alternatively, we might check the Cisco documentation? But we don't have it. We rely on the problem.\n\n We'll proceed.\n\n But note: the problem says the version is 6.3.1. The endpoint might be different? But the problem does not provide an alternative.\n\n We are using the endpoint from the function example.\n\n So we output the above.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have all the parameters? Yes.\n\n We are making one function call.\n\n But note: the function expects the `params` to be a dict, and we are representing it as a JSON string and setting type='dict'. We hope the system can handle it.\n\n If the system does not support non-scalar types, then we cannot call this function. But the instruction says we can use type='dict'. So we assume it is supported.\n\n Therefore, we output the function call as above."}

According to the function doc, ironing service has an ID of 2 (since 1 is cleaning, 2 is ironing, 3 is comprehensive cleaning).\n- Province: Bangkok. The function doc says Bangkok has an ID of 1.\n- District: Chatuchak District. We can pass this as `district_name`.\n- Rating: 4.5 stars or more. We note that the function parameter `rating` is the average rating. We want at least 4.5, so we can set `rating` to 4.5.\n\nHowever, note that the function does not have a parameter for the minimum rating. The description says: \"The average rating of the service provider's review score\". It is not clear if setting `rating=4.5` will return services with rating >=4.5 or exactly 4.5. The function documentation does not specify.\n\nBut since the function is designed to filter by the given rating, and the user wants 4.5 or more, we can try passing 4.5 and hope that the function interprets it as a minimum. Alternatively, the function might be designed to return services with at least that rating?

So we must provide them? But the user didn't specify.\n\n    Alternatively, we can set them to an empty string? But the function might not accept. \n\n    Since the problem says to point out if lacking required parameters, but we are not sure, and the user did not specify district and sub-district, we have to make a decision.\n\n    Let's look at the function description again: \n        district_name (str): The name of the district. Example: 'Watthana', 'Thon Buri'.\n        sub_district_name (str): The name of the sub-district. Example: 'Phra Khanong', 'Khlong Toei'.\n\n    There is no mention of required. But the example in the function call format includes them. \n\n    Since the problem does not specify that we can omit, and the function might require them, we must point out the lack? \n\n    However, the task is to help the user. We are to try our best. \n\n    Considering the problem says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n    But note: the function has parameters that are not provided. We have two options:\n        Option 1: Call the function without these parameters? But the function call format we are to use must have the parameters? \n        Option 2: Point out that the parameters are missing.\n\n    However, the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and if we cannot call, we point out? But how? The instruction says we must return the function calls in the specified format, or if we cannot, we point it out? But the format is strict: only function calls.\n\n    Actually, the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" but then it says \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\".\n\n    This is conflicting. However, note that the example format does not have a way to point out missing parameters. \n\n    Therefore, I think we are allowed to call the function with the parameters we have and set the missing ones to an empty string? But the function might require non-empty? \n\n    Alternatively, the problem might have intended that we use the function even without the optional parameters? \n\n    Since the function docstring does not specify that district_name and sub_district_name are required (it doesn't say \"required\", and the example just shows examples), we can assume they are optional? \n\n    But the function call in the example format includes them. How about we set them to an empty string? \n\n    Let me re-read the function description: \n        \"Retrieves a list of service providers based on the specified criteria including service type, location, and availability.\"\n\n    It says \"including\", meaning that we can specify as many as we have? \n\n    Therefore, I will set district_name and sub_district_name to empty strings.\n\n 4. Rating: at least 4.5, so we set rating=4.5.\n 5. Availability: \n        The user says: available on 12/03/2024 16:00 - 18:00.\n        We have two parameters: \n            start_available_date: the start of the period when the provider is available.\n            end_available_date: the end of the period.\n\n        But note: the function parameters are:\n            start_available_date (str, default='null (represents the current date and time)'): ... \n            end_available_date (str, default='null (represents no specific end date)'): ...\n\n        We are to set:\n            start_available_date: '2024-03-12 16:00:00'\n            end_available_date: '2024-03-12 18:00:00'\n\n        But note: the date format in the function is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. The user provided 12/03/2024, which is DD/MM/YYYY? \n        So we must convert: 12 March 2024 -> 2024-03-12.\n\n 6. However, note the function expects the province_id as integer. We know Chonburi is 3.\n\n Let's map:\n    service_id: 2 (for ironing service)\n    province_id: 3 (for Chonburi)\n    district_name: not provided -> set to empty string? But the function expects string. We'll set as empty string? \n        Alternatively, we can set to None? But the function expects string? The docstring says type is str. \n        We can set to empty string? But the function might interpret empty string as a valid value? \n        Since the problem doesn't specify, we'll set to empty string.\n\n    sub_district_name: same as above -> empty string.\n\n    rating: 4.5 (float)\n    start_available_date: '2024-03-12 16:00:00'\n    end_available_date: '2024-03-12 18:00:00'\n\n But note: the function's default for start_available_date is the current date and time and for end_available_date is no specific end date. \n We are overriding both.\n\n However, the user request is for a specific time slot. We are setting the availability period exactly to that slot? \n The function will return providers available during that entire period? \n\n So we are set.\n\n Function call:\n    get_service_providers(\n        service_id=2,\n        province_id=3,\n        district_name='',\n        sub_district_name='',\n        rating=4.5,\n        start_available_date='2024-03-12 16:00:00',\n        end_available_date='2024-03-12 18:00:00'\n    )\n\n But note: the function parameter names must match exactly.\n\n Let's write in the required XML format.\n\n Note: the types:\n    service_id: integer\n    province_id: integer\n    district_name: string\n    sub_district_name: string\n    rating: float\n    start_available_date: string\n    end_available_date: string\n\n We are going to output:\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"get_service_providers\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"service_id\" value=\"2\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"province_id\" value=\"3\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"district_name\" value=\"\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"sub_district_name\" value=\"\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"rating\" value=\"4.5\" type=\"float\"/>\n      <param name=\"start_available_date\" value=\"2024-03-12 16:00:00\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"end_available_date\" value=\"2024-03-12 18:00:00\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n However, note: the date format in the user input was 12/03/2024, which we interpreted as DD/MM/YYYY. \n But the user said: \"12/03/2024\", which in Thailand is usually day/month/year. So we converted to 2024-03-12.\n\n But what if the function expects a different timezone? The problem does not specify. We assume the time is in the local time of the province.\n\n Since the problem does not specify timezone, we use the given time as is.\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}

We have two options:\n 1. We can set a default date range (for example, from today to a week from now) to cover near-term availability.\n 2. But the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters, point it out. However, we are only allowed to output function calls or point out the lack? But the instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" and then in the next paragraph: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" - this is a conflict.\n\n But note: the system expects only function calls in the response. Therefore, we must try to fill in the parameters as best as we can.\n\n Since the user didn't specify dates, we can choose a reasonable default? However, the function does not have default for these parameters? They are required.\n\n How about we set the start_available_date to today (2024-02-21) and the end_available_date to a month from now? But the user might not have specified, so we are making an assumption.\n\n Alternatively, we might leave the dates out? But the function requires them.\n\n The function signature does not mark them as having a default. Therefore, we must provide them.\n\n Let's set:\n   start_available_date: '2024-02-21 00:00:00'\n   end_available_date: '2024-03-21 00:00:00'\n\n Also, note:\n   service_id: for ironing service, we know that 2 represents ironing service (as per the docstring).\n   province_id: Chiang Mai is 2.\n   district_name: Sankampang District -> we use the string \"Sankampang\"\n   sub_district_name: Ton Pao Subdistrict -> we use the string \"Ton Pao\"\n   rating: 4.5\n\n The parameter `has_late_check_in` is optional (default=False) so we can skip it.\n\n Therefore, we can call the function with these parameters.\n\n However, note: the function expects `district_name` and `sub_district_name` (note the spelling: sub_district_name, but in the function argument it's written as `sub_district_name`). The user provided \"Sankampang District\" and \"Ton Pao Subdistrict\". We should use just the name without the word \"District\" or \"Subdistrict\"? But the function doesn't specify. We'll use the exact string provided by the user? But the user said \"Sankampang District\" and \"Ton Pao Subdistrict\". However, in the function, we are expected to pass the name of the district and sub-district. It might be that the database uses the full name? Or just the name without the administrative division? We don't know. We'll use the string as provided by the user.\n\n Alternatively, we can try without the words \"District\" and \"Subdistrict\"? But the user included them. To be safe, we'll use the exact string the user provided.\n\n But note: the function parameter names are `district_name` and `sub_district_name`. We'll pass:\n\n   district_name: \"Sankampang District\"\n   sub_district_name: \"Ton Pao Subdistrict\"\n\n However, the user wrote: \"Sankampang District\" and \"Ton Pao Subdistrict\". But note the user wrote \"Ton Pao\" (with a space) and the function expects a string.\n\n Alternatively, we can try without the administrative division? But without knowing the database, we cannot be sure. Since the user specified the full name, we use it.\n\n Also, note: the function expects a float for rating.

We use that.\n\n However, the user wrote: \"Ton Pao Subdistrict\" -> we use that string.\n\n But wait: the function expects `sub_district_name` and we are passing the full string. This is acceptable.\n\n Also, note: the user wrote \"Sankampang\" and \"Ton Pao\", so we use that.\n\n One more thing: the user said \"housewife\", but the function is about professionals. We assume that housewives are included in the professional workers? The function doesn't specify. We are using the same function.\n\n Since the function is for professional workers and the user asks for a housewife, we hope the data includes housewives.\n\n We have no other function, so we use this.\n\n Therefore, we output the above XML."}
