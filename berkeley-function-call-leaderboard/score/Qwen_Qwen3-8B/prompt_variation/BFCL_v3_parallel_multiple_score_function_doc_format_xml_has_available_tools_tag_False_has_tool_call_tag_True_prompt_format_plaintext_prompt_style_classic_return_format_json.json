Then, for lunch, I want to try a new restaurant that serves dishes with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce, and the dishes should not be more than 500 calories. In the evening, I have a recipe for dinner that uses beef, but I want to replace the beef with tofu and keep the total calories under 600. Can you assist me with these?\""}]], "function": [{"name": "recipe_search", "description": "Searches for recipes based on a list of ingredients and a maximum caloric value.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"ingredients": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of ingredients you want to use in the recipe."}, "calories": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum number of calories for the recipe."}, "meal": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the meal for the recipe, it's optional and could be breakfast, lunch or dinner.
