The function data_loading is available for that. The parameters required are file_path and an optional delimiter, which defaults to ','. So I should call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. Assuming the data is a dictionary or a DataFrame, those columns would be arrays. Then, I can pass those arrays to the linear_regression_fit function. The parameters for that function are x and y, which are arrays of floats. Also, the user wants the residuals, so I need to set return_residuals=True.\n\nWait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as arrays. But how do I get those from the loaded data? The user specified x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so after loading the data, those columns should be accessible. However, the functions provided don't include a way to process the data beyond loading and fitting. So I have to assume that the data_loading function returns a structure where those keys exist.\n\nSo the steps are: first call data_loading to get the data, then use that data's 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns in the linear_regression_fit with return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the function calls, how do I reference the data from the previous function? The system might handle that internally. The user's instruction is to make the necessary function calls.

For the first one, it's a 4ft x 4ft marble statue in Philadelphia. The second is 6ft x 3ft bronze in New York. The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nSo, for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with their respective parameters.

Second sculpture: museum_location is New York, material is bronze, size is [6,3]. \n\nWait, the size is 4ft x 4ft, so maybe the size parameter expects [4,4], but sometimes sculptures might have three dimensions (height, width, depth). But the user only provided two for each. The function's sculpture_size is an array of integers, so I'll use the given values as provided.\n\nSo I need to make two separate calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture.

The user has three parts to their question. \n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from 5 moles of glucose. The function biological.calc_energy seems right here. The parameters required are mols and substance. They mentioned glucose (C6H12O6) and the default joules_per_mol is 2800, which matches the given value. So I'll call calc_energy with mols=5 and substance=\"C6H12O6\".\n\nSecond, using that energy, calculate the biomass with 10% efficiency. The function biological.calc_biomass requires energy and efficiency. Since efficiency defaults to 0.1 (10%), I just need to pass the energy from the first step. But I need to make sure to use the energy value obtained from the first calculation. However, since the functions are separate, I'll have to call calc_biomass with the energy parameter as the result of the first function. But in the tool call, I can reference the previous result. Wait, but in the tool call format, each function is called independently. So I need to first get the energy value, then use it in the next function. Since the user wants the steps in order, I'll first call calc_energy, then use its output in calc_biomass. But in the tool call, I can't reference previous results directly. Hmm, maybe the user expects each step to be called in sequence, so I need to make two separate tool calls here.

So I can plug in 5000, 5, and 4 here.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 5 years, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually. The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1.

The parameters for that are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. Wait, the rate given is 5%, so I need to convert that to 0.05.

That should get the list.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function requires game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation', and region='Asia'. The region is specified, so I'll include that.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name='Apple Inc.' and year=2018. The case_type isn't specified, so I'll leave it out.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function takes number_of_trials=10, number_of_successes=3, and probability_of_success=0.7. The default for probability is 0.5, but here it's given as 0.7, so I'll include that.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present and format each function call correctly. Let me check each function's required fields again to confirm. All required parameters are covered. Now, structure the tool calls in order."}
