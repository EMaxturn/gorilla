They mentioned \"today,\" so I need to set movie_date to today's date. The system note says to default to the current date in India. Since the user didn't specify a date format, but the function requires 'YYYY-MM-DD', I should format today's date accordingly. Let me check today's date in India. Assuming today is 2023-10-05, but I should actually get the current date. Wait, as an AI, I don't have real-time data, but the function's default for movie_date is None, which probably means it uses the current date. However, the user explicitly said \"today,\" so maybe I should set movie_date to today's date in India. But since the function's default is the current date, maybe it's redundant. However, to be precise, perhaps include it. Also, the user didn't mention cinema hall, language, or format, so those can be omitted. The function's default for movie_format is 2D, which is fine unless the user specified otherwise. So the correct call would be get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date in India. Wait, but the system note says to consider the movie date as today's date in India. So even if the function's default is current date, maybe the user's \"today\" refers to India's current date. Since the function's default is current date, which should be the same as India's if the system is set up correctly. So maybe just setting city='Mumbai' is sufficient, and the default date is today. But the user explicitly said \"today,\" so including movie_date with today's date in India would be better. However, without real-time data, how do I get today's date? The function's default is None for movie_date, but the description says default is current date. So perhaps the function handles it. Therefore, the correct call is get_movies(city='Mumbai'). But to be safe, maybe include movie_date as today's date. Wait, but the user might be in a different timezone. The system note says to default to India's current date.

The user wants to book a flight from JFK on March 16, 2024, around 14:00. The available function is book_flight, which requires departure_location, departure_date, and departure_time.\n\nFirst, the departure_location is JFK, which is valid as an airport code. The departure_date is March 16, 2024. The function specifies the date format as dd/mm/yyyy, so I need to convert that. March 16 would be 16/03/2024. The date must be after 14/03/2024, which it is. \n\nThe departure_time is around 14:00. The function uses 24-hour format, so 14:00 is correct. I should check if the time is exactly 14:00 or if there's a range, but the user said \"around,\" but the function might need an exact time. Since the user specified 14:00, I'll use that. \n\nAll required parameters are present: departure_location, departure_date, departure_time. So the function call should be book_flight with those parameters. I need to format the date as 16/03/2024 and time as 14:00. Let me make sure there are no typos. Yes, that's correct. So the tool call is ready."}
