They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients or special instructions, so those can be omitted.\n\nThen, for the drink part, they want to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink. The parameters are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences need to be a dictionary. The preferences mentioned are size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness \"regular\", and milk \"almond\". So the new_preferences dict should include all these key-value pairs. I need to make sure the keys are correct, maybe like \"size\", \"temperature\", \"sweetness\", and \"milk\".\n\nWait, the function for the drink requires new_preferences as a dict. The user specified \"large hot coffee\", which probably translates to size and temperature. Also, \"regular sweetness\" and \"almond milk\" are additional preferences.

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is perfect here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I'll use that as repo_url. Since the destination isn't specified, it'll clone to the current directory by default. No need for recursive or depth parameters here unless specified, which they aren't. So the first function call is clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The function analyse_repo_contents takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned to the current directory, the directory_name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo name is the directory). Wait, but the user didn't specify a destination, so the cloned repo would be in the current directory with the name from the URL, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. So I'll use that as directory_name for the analysis.\n\nOnce the analysis is done, I need to create or update the Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file requires the directory_name. Again, 'nodejs-welcome' should be the directory. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAML files. The function create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., are optional. Since the user says \"based on the analysis,\" maybe the image name would be derived from the repo. But since the user hasn't provided specific values, I'll just use the directory name as the deployment name and assume the image is 'latest' as default. So deployment_name could be 'nodejs-welcome', image_name='latest', but the user might expect defaults. However, the function allows defaults if not provided. So maybe just pass directory_name='nodejs-welcome' and let the function handle the rest with defaults.\n\nAfter creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, the next step is to add all changed files to Git. The function push_git_changes_to_github can handle adding, committing, and pushing. The directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. The commit message and branch name aren't specified, so I'll need to use default values or leave them out. The function's description says it will automatically git add all changes, so no need for a separate add step. For the commit message, maybe use a default like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\". The branch name might default to the current branch, which is probably 'main' or 'master'. The user didn't specify force push, so that's false by default.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo.\n3. Create Dockerfile.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs.\n5. Push changes with a commit message.\n\nSo the function calls in order would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nEach with the appropriate parameters. Let me check the parameters again to make sure.\n\nFor clone_repo: repo_url is given. Destination is optional, so omitted. Recursive and depth are optional, so omitted.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_a_docker_file: directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name='nodejs-welcome'. The other parameters are optional, so they can be omitted, allowing the function to use defaults.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github: directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message needs to be provided since it's optional but required for a meaningful commit. The user says \"add all changed files to git changes\" and then commit/push. The function's description says it will git add all changes, so no need for additional steps. The commit message is required, but the user didn't specify, so I'll have to make one up, like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\". Branch name is optional, so if not provided, it uses the current branch. Force_push is false by default.\n\nSo the final function calls should be as listed."}

So I should use the 'get_relevant_classes' function with 'CellResult' as the search string and set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides. For that, I'll use the 'get_signature' function twice, once for each method. The class name is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method names are provided. Since the user didn't mention private methods, I can omit the include_private parameter or set it to false.\n\nWait, do I need to check if 'AbstractCellHandler' exists? Maybe, but the user mentioned it's part of their project, so I'll assume it's there. Also, the user didn't specify a module name, so I'll leave that out.
