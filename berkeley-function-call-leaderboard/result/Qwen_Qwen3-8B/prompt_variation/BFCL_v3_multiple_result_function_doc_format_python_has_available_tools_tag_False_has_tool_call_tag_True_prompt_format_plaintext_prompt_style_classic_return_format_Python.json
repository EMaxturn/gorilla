The parameters required are all provided in the question: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2. \n\nI don't need to use the 'calculate_final_speed' here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct function to call is 'calculate_displacement' with the given parameters. Let me make sure all required args are there. Yes, initial_speed, acceleration, and time are all provided. So the tool call should include those values."}

The user provided all three: game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call store_price with those parameters. The other functions like on_sale and store_currency don't seem relevant here. The default region for store_price is US, but since the user specified US, it's safe to include it.

The functions provided include 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Let me check the parameters for that function. The function requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem's condition. So I can use this function by passing distance=20 and time=4. The function should compute the final speed.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're the same gas, maybe it's a weighted average? Wait, the formula for final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas would be (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nSo, the formula would be T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2). That makes sense because the total \"thermal energy\" is conserved. Since the gas is the same, the molar heat capacities would be the same, so they cancel out. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. Perfect. The user provided all the necessary parameters: 2 moles, 300 K, 3 moles, 400 K. So I can directly call that function with these values. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_mass here because the problem is about temperature mixing, not mass.

The user mentioned \"a roll of two dice,\" so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, which is standard for dice.

The sides_per_die is not mentioned, but since it's standard, I can include it as 6. However, if the function has a default for sides_per_die, maybe it's optional.

However, the function's default for month is \"upcoming,\" so maybe it's redundant.

The function requires location, art_form, and month (optional, default upcoming), user_ratings (optional, default high).
