The user needs an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. Looking at the functions provided, there's 'uber.ride' and 'uber.ride2'. \n\nFirst, check the parameters required for each. The 'uber.ride' function requires 'loc', 'type', and 'time'. The 'uber.ride2' also needs 'loc', 'type', and has a 'time' with a default of 10.\n\nThe user provided the location as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits the 'loc' parameter. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. The time is 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the 'uber.ride2' has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, so maybe either function could work. However, the first function 'uber.ride' requires 'time' as a required parameter, so it's necessary to include it. The second function's 'time' is optional with a default, but since the user provided it, maybe it's better to include it in both.\n\nBut the user's question mentions 'loc' in the format 'Street Address, City, State', which matches the 'loc' parameter for 'uber.ride'. The 'uber.ride2' uses 'City, State' for loc, but the user's address includes the street. However, the 'uber.ride' function's 'loc' example includes the street, so maybe that's the correct one to use.\n\nSo, the correct function to call is 'uber.ride' with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. The 'uber.ride2' might not be necessary here since the user's location includes the street address, which is required by 'uber.ride'. Also, the 'time' is provided, so using 'uber.ride' makes sense."}

The parameters required are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user has provided the keyword, and they want text format, which matches the default 'text' in the function. The max_results should be set to 10 as requested. The language isn't specified, so the default 'EN' is okay, but since the query is in Korean, maybe the user wants the results in Korean? Wait, the function's language parameter defaults to 'EN', but the user's query is in Korean. However, the function's description says the search results' language is specified by the 'language' parameter. The user didn't mention language, so maybe stick with the default. But the function's parameters allow the language to be set. Wait, the user's instruction is in Korean, but the function's default is 'EN'. However, the user might expect the results in Korean. But the function's parameters don't have a Korean option. The enum for language in HNA_WQA.search is ['EN', 'ES', 'FR', 'DE'], so no Korean. Therefore, the results will be in English by default. But the user's query is in Korean. Maybe that's okay. The user just wants the info, regardless of language. So proceed with the default language. \n\nSo, the function call should be HNA_WQA.search with keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format 'text', max_results 10. The language is default 'EN', which is acceptable. So the JSON should include those parameters."}

Since the user hasn't provided any prior information about Shishir Patil's birthday, I should check the recall memory search function. But wait, the user hasn't mentioned any previous conversations about Shishir Patil, so maybe the birthday isn't in the recall memory. \n\nNext, the core memory has the 'human' section which stores user details. However, the user hasn't provided any information about Shishir Patil in the core memory. The archival memory might have some data, but without a specific query, I can't assume. \n\nSince the user is asking for a birthday, which isn't in the provided functions' parameters, I need to check if any of the functions can retrieve that info. The 'recall_memory_search' function can search the conversation history, but if there's no prior mention, it might not find anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to know Shishir Patil's birthday from general knowledge. But according to the functions, I can't access external data. The 'http_request' function could be used to fetch it, but the user hasn't provided a URL or method. \n\nWait, the user's question is to send a congratulatory message. If I don't have the birthday, I can't send a message. So perhaps the user expects me to use the 'send_message' function with a generic message, but that's not accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the birthday isn't available. In that case, I should inform them that I can't retrieve the birthday. But the user wants the message sent. \n\nHmm, the functions don't include a way to look up birthdays. So I can't proceed. Therefore, I should point out that the necessary information isn't available. But the user might expect me to use the 'send_message' function with a placeholder. However, that's not correct. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to use the functions provided. Since there's no function to get the birthday, I can't proceed. So the answer is that the required parameters are missing. But the user wants the message sent. Maybe the user expects me to use the 'send_message' function with a message, but without the birthday, it's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is to state that the birthday information is not available. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. So the answer is that the birthday isn't in the memory, so I can't send the message. But the user might have intended to provide the birthday in the question. Wait, the user's question is \"What's Shishir Patil's birthday and send a contraguation message to him.\" So the user is asking for two things: the birthday and the message. Since the birthday isn't in the memory, I can't do that. Therefore, I need to inform the user that the birthday isn't available. But the functions don't allow me to look it up. So the answer is that the required parameters are missing."}

They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview needs total deposits, total withdrawals, start and end dates.

The starting and ending balances are part of the account info, but the function parameters don't include them. However, the user might expect those to be included in the overview. But since the function doesn't take them as parameters, maybe they are part of the transaction_overview or the function's output.

The user also mentioned the starting and ending balances, but since the function doesn't take them as parameters, they might be part of the output. The user might need to be informed that those balances are not included in the parameters but are part of the overview. \n\nSo the correct function call is to BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters."}

But the show_date parameter has no default value. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without it. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to point out that the show_date is missing. However, the user might not have provided it. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the show_date is required. But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. \n\nBut the user's question is asking for the current showtimes. Therefore, the assistant should call the function with the current date. However, since the assistant can't access the current date, perhaps the user is expected to provide it. \n\nWait, the user's message is \"I'm after an Imax film at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville can you tell me whats on?\" So the user is asking for the current showtimes. Therefore, the assistant should call the function with the current date. But since the assistant can't know the current date, maybe the user is expected to provide it. \n\nBut the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the assistant should call the function but needs the show_date. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the show_date is required. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the show_date is required. However, the user might not have provided it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using today's date. But since the assistant can't access real-time data, perhaps the user is expected to provide the date. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should call the function with the parameters movie_name, location, and show_date. The user hasn't provided the movie name, but the question is about an Imax film. Wait, the user is asking for Imax films, so the show_type is Imax. \n\nWait, the user is asking for Imax films, so the show_type should be Imax. The location is Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville. So the location parameter is \"Danville, CA\". \n\nBut the user hasn't specified the movie name. The function requires movie_name. Therefore, the assistant needs to call the Movies_1_FindMovies function to find the available movies at that location and show type. \n\nWait, the user is asking for what's on, so maybe first find the movies available at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville with Imax show type, and then get the show times. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\n1. Use Movies_1_FindMovies to search for movies at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville with show_type Imax. \n\nBut the function requires location, theater_name (optional), genre (optional), show_type. \n\nSo the parameters would be location: \"Danville, CA\", theater_name: \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type: \"imax\". \n\nThen, once the movies are found, the assistant can get the show times for each movie using Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie. \n\nBut the user hasn't specified the movie name, so the assistant needs to first find the available movies. \n\nTherefore, the first function call should be Movies_1_FindMovies with location: \"Danville, CA\", theater_name: \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type: \"imax\". \n\nThen, once the movies are found, the assistant can proceed to get the show times for each movie. \n\nBut the user's question is \"can you tell me what's on?\" which is about the current showtimes. So the assistant needs to first find the movies available, then get the show times. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the movie name, so the assistant needs to first find the movies. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with the parameters location: \"Danville, CA\", theater_name: \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type: \"imax\". \n\nBut the user's message is \"I'm after an Imax film at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville can you tell me whats on?\" So the user is looking for Imax films at that theater. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the list of movies available at that theater with Imax show type. Then, for each movie, call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie with the current date. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date, so the assistant needs to proceed with the current date. However, the function requires the show_date. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the movies, then call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie for each movie with the current date. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the date, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the movies, and then ask the user for the date. \n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make function calls if possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using today's date. But since the assistant can't access real-time data, perhaps the user is expected to provide the date. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the show_date is missing. \n\nBut the user is asking for \"what's on\", which is the current showtimes. Therefore, the assistant should call the function with the current date. However, the assistant can't know the current date. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The function requires show_date, which is not provided by the user. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the show_date is required. \n\nBut the user might not have provided it. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the show_date is required. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should return that the show_date is missing. But the user's question is about the current showtimes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using the current date. But since the assistant can't access real-time data, perhaps the user is expected to provide the date. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should call the function with the parameters that are available. The user provided the location (Danville, CA), theater name (Century Blackhawk Plaza), and show_type (Imax). But the movie_name is not provided. \n\nWait, the user is asking for Imax films, so the show_type is Imax. The location is Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville. \n\nBut the function Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie requires movie_name, location, and show_date. The user hasn't provided the movie name. Therefore, the assistant can't call that function without the movie name. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the list of movies available at that theater with Imax show type. \n\nSo the first function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with location: \"Danville, CA\", theater_name: \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type: \"imax\". \n\nOnce that is done, the assistant can get the list of movies, then for each movie, call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie with the current date (assuming the user wants today's showtimes). \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date, so the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the movies, then ask the user for the date. \n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make function calls if possible. Therefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the movies. \n\nSo the correct function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with the parameters location: \"Danville, CA\", theater_name: \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type: \"imax\". \n\nThen, once the movies are found, the assistant can proceed to get the show times for each movie. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date, so the assistant can't call the GetTimesForMovie function without it. Therefore, the assistant should first call FindMovies, then ask for the date. \n\nBut the problem says that the assistant should make function calls if possible. Therefore, the assistant should first call FindMovies. \n\nSo the answer is to call Movies_1_FindMovies with the given parameters."}

The user wants to hear a Hillbilly style song from 2019 and mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" is good. First, I need to figure out which functions to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions, Music_3_LookupMusic can search for songs based on genre and year. The user specified Hillbilly style, which is a genre. The year is 2019. The album name might not be necessary here since the user is looking for songs in that genre and year. But wait, they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" specifically. Maybe I should check if that album is in the search results. However, the LookupMusic function allows filtering by artist, album, genre, and year. The user didn't mention an artist, so maybe leave that as default. \n\nSo, using Music_3_LookupMusic with genre set to 'Hillbilly' (but wait, checking the enum for genre in the function: the allowed genres include 'Hillbilly'? Let me check again. The enum for genre in Music_3_LookupMusic is ['Reggae', 'Holiday', 'Electropop', 'Pop', 'Asia', 'House', 'Electronica', 'Funk', 'Rock', 'Metal', 'Dubstep', 'Country', 'dontcare']. Oh, Hillbilly isn't listed here. The closest might be 'Country', but that's a different genre. The user specified Hillbilly, which might not be an exact match. Alternatively, maybe the function doesn't support Hillbilly, so perhaps the user's request can't be fully met. But maybe the user is okay with Country if Hillbilly isn't available. Alternatively, maybe the function's genre parameter is limited, so I have to use the closest available. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to Country music, which is in the enum. So, perhaps the genre should be 'Country' instead. But the user said Hillbilly. Hmm. Maybe the function doesn't support Hillbilly, so I need to proceed with the available options. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the genre. But I have to work with the given functions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with using the 'Country' genre. So, I'll proceed with genre as 'Country' and year 2019. Then, after getting the list, maybe the album 'Gotta Be Me' is in there. If not, maybe the next step is to play the track from that album. But the user might need to first find the song. \n\nSo, first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country' (assuming that's the closest match) and year 2019. Then, if the album 'Gotta Be Me' is in the results, use Music_3_PlayMedia to play the track from that album. But the user hasn't specified a track title yet. Alternatively, maybe the LookupMusic will return songs from the album. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play the album 'Gotta Be Me' which is Hillbilly style from 2019. But the PlayMedia function requires a track title, not an album. So, perhaps first, use LookupMusic to find tracks in Hillbilly (or Country) from 2019, then select a track from the album 'Gotta Be Me' and play it. \n\nBut since the genre 'Hillbilly' isn't in the enum, maybe the user's request can't be fully met. However, the user might be okay with Country. So, proceed with that. \n\nSo, first function call: Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019'. Then, if the album 'Gotta Be Me' is in the results, then use PlayMedia with track from that album. But the user hasn't specified the track title. So, maybe the LookupMusic will return the tracks, and then the user can choose. But the user's message is to play a song, so maybe after getting the list, the next step is to play one of them. However, the user hasn't specified which track, so maybe the system needs to call PlayMedia with the album name. But the PlayMedia function requires a track title. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the album 'Gotta Be Me' and wants to play it. But the PlayMedia function requires a track, not an album. So, perhaps the user needs to specify a track. But the user hasn't. So, maybe the system can't proceed without more info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with playing the album as a whole, but the function only plays tracks. So, perhaps the system can't do that. \n\nIn this case, the user's request is to play a Hillbilly song from 2019, specifically from the album 'Gotta Be Me'. Since the genre isn't available, maybe the system can't find it. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, the system can proceed with the available options. \n\nSo, the first step is to use Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country' and year 2019. Then, if the album 'Gotta Be Me' is in the results, then use PlayMedia with the track from that album. But the user hasn't specified the track title. So, maybe the system can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with playing the album, but the function requires a track. So, the system can't do that. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country' and year 2019, then use the results to find a track from the album 'Gotta Be Me' and play it. But since the user hasn't specified the track title, the system might need to assume a track. However, the function requires the track title. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the album, and the system can't play an album, so the answer is that the function can't be used. But the user wants to play a song, so maybe the system can use the LookupMusic to find the track and then play it. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track title. So, the system can't call PlayMedia without the track. Therefore, the first step is to use LookupMusic to find the track, then use PlayMedia. \n\nSo, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country' (since Hillbilly isn't available) and year '2019'. Then, if the album 'Gotta Be Me' is in the results, the next step is to play a track from that album. But the user hasn't specified the track title. So, maybe the system can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with playing the album, but the function requires a track. Therefore, the system can't proceed. \n\nBut the user's message is to play a song, so the system needs to find a track. Therefore, the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country' and year '2019', then use the results to play a track from the album 'Gotta Be Me'. \n\nBut since the user hasn't specified the track title, the system can't call PlayMedia without it. Therefore, the system can't proceed. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned the album 'Gotta Be Me' is really good. So, maybe the system can use that album name in the LookupMusic function. But the LookupMusic function allows filtering by album. So, maybe the user wants to find songs from the album 'Gotta Be Me' in the Hillbilly genre (but that's not available). \n\nAlternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the genre. So, the system can proceed with the available options. \n\nSo, the correct function calls would be:\n\nFirst, call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019', and album 'Gotta Be Me'. Then, if there are results, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track from that album. But the user hasn't specified the track title. \n\nAlternatively, the system can't proceed without the track title. Therefore, the answer is that the parameters are missing. \n\nBut the user's message is to play a song, so the system needs to find a track. Therefore, the first step is to use Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019', and album 'Gotta Be Me'. Then, if there are tracks, play one. \n\nBut the PlayMedia function requires a track title. So, the system can't call PlayMedia without that. Therefore, the answer is that the parameters are missing. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the track title. Therefore, the system can't call PlayMedia. \n\nSo, the correct function call is to use Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019', and album 'Gotta Be Me'. Then, the system can get the list of tracks and choose one. But the user hasn't specified which track, so the system can't proceed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters, and then the user can select a track. But the user hasn't provided the track title, so the system can't call PlayMedia. \n\nBut the user's request is to play a song, so the system needs to find a track. Therefore, the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the available parameters. \n\nSo, the function calls would be:\n\n[{\"function\":\"Music_3_LookupMusic\",\"parameters\":{\"genre\":\"Country\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"album\":\"Gotta Be Me\"}}]"}
{"id": "live_multiple_847-179-1", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to book a table for four at Balthazar in New York this Friday at 8 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are Restaurants_2_ReserveRestaurant and Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants. Since the user is asking to book a reservation, the ReserveRestaurant function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for ReserveRestaurant: restaurant_name, location, time, date, and number_of_seats. The user provided the restaurant name as Balthazar, location as New York. The time is 8 PM, which in 24-hour format is 20:00. The date is this Friday. I need to figure out the exact date. Assuming today is, say, October 5th, this Friday would be October 12th, 2023. But since the current date isn't given, maybe the function expects the user to input the date. Wait, the user said \"this Friday,\" so I need to calculate the correct date based on the current date. However, since the system might not have real-time data, perhaps the user expects the date to be filled in as 'this Friday' but the function requires an ISO date. Hmm, maybe the user's message is a bit ambiguous here. But the function requires a specific date in YYYY-MM-DD format. So I need to convert \"this Friday\" into the correct date. Let me assume that the current date is October 5th, so this Friday is October 12th. But without knowing the actual current date, maybe the user expects the assistant to handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the date isn't specified. Wait, the user didn't provide the date, just \"this Friday.\" The function requires a date parameter. So maybe the user needs to specify the exact date, but they said \"this Friday.\" So perhaps the assistant should use the current date's Friday. However, since the system might not have access to the current date, maybe the user is expected to provide the date. But in the question, the user says \"this Friday,\" so maybe the assistant should proceed with that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle relative dates, but according to the parameters, the date is required in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant needs to figure out the correct date.

But since the actual current date isn't provided, maybe the assistant should use the date as given by the user, but the user said \"this Friday,\" which is a relative term. However, the function requires an exact date. Therefore, the user's request might be missing the date parameter.

However, in the context of the problem, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the given information, even if it's a relative date. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to handle it. But according to the function's parameters, the date is required. Therefore, the assistant must have the date.

The user wants to find a bus itinerary from Fresno, CA to Los Angeles on March 10th, 2023. They mentioned they're traveling alone.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are Buses_3_FindBus, Buses_3_BuyBusTicket, Hotels_4_ReserveHotel, and Hotels_4_SearchHotel. Since the user is asking for an itinerary, the Buses_3_FindBus function seems appropriate. \n\nLooking at the parameters for Buses_3_FindBus: from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles, and departure_date as March 10th, 2023. The date format required is MM/DD/YYYY, so March 10th would be 03/10/2023. The user is traveling alone, so num_passengers should be 1. The category is optional with defaults for direct or one-stop. Since they didn't specify, the default 'direct' is fine.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required ones are from_city, to_city, and departure_date. The user provided all three. The other parameters like num_passengers have defaults, but since they mentioned traveling alone, setting it to 1 is correct. \n\nSo the function call should be Buses_3_FindBus with from_city: \"Fresno, CA\", to_city: \"Los Angeles, CA\", departure_date: \"03/10/2023\", num_passengers: 1, and category: \"direct\" (though category is optional with default, but including it might be better to ensure direct route). Wait, the category's default is 'direct', so maybe it's not necessary to include it, but the user didn't specify, so maybe just leave it out. However, the function's parameters have category as optional with default, so maybe it's better to omit it unless specified. But the user didn't mention anything about the route category, so the default is acceptable. \n\nSo the correct function call is Buses_3_FindBus with the required parameters and num_passengers set to 1. The category can be left out as it has a default. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters are from_city, to_city, departure_date. The user provided those. The num_passengers is optional with default 1, but since the user said they're traveling alone, it's safe to include it as 1. So the parameters would be from_city: \"Fresno, CA\", to_city: \"Los Angeles, CA\", departure_date: \"03/10/2023\", num_passengers: 1. The category is optional, so maybe not needed here. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be correct with those parameters."}

The 'get_api_tokens' function seems appropriate here. The user ID is given as \"user123\", which is a string. The parameters for 'get_api_tokens' require user_id, which is a string, so that's good. The include_expired parameter is optional and defaults to False, but since the user didn't specify, we can leave it as default. \n\nWait, but the user might have both regular API tokens and shareable ones. However, the question is about reminding them of all API tokens, so maybe both functions are needed? But the 'get_shareable_api_tokens' is for custom dashboards. The user didn't mention dashboards, so maybe just the first function is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'get_api_tokens' is for all tokens, including shareable ones. But according to the function descriptions, 'get_api_tokens' is for tokens associated with the user's account, while 'get_shareable_api_tokens' is specifically for custom dashboards. Since the user is asking for all API tokens, perhaps both functions should be called to get all possible tokens. However, the user might not have shareable tokens, but to be thorough, maybe call both. \n\nBut the user's main request is to remind them of all API tokens. The 'get_api_tokens' function would retrieve the list of API tokens for the user, which is what they need. The 'get_shareable_api_tokens' is for shareable ones, which might be a subset. However, the user didn't specify any context about dashboards, so maybe just the first function is enough. \n\nSo, the correct function to call is 'get_api_tokens' with user_id \"user123\". The parameters are user_id (required) and include_expired (optional, default False). Since the user didn't mention expired tokens, we can use the default. Therefore, the function call should be to get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\"."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert type is error rate, threshold is 5%, and recipients are two emails.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The create_global_application_alert_config function seems right. Let me look at its parameters. The required fields are name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. The alert_type has to be one of the enums: error_rate, response_time, traffic_spike. The user specified error rate, which is valid. The threshold is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. Recipients are an array of strings, so the two emails should be in a list. The enabled parameter has a default of True, so maybe it's optional. The user didn't mention enabling it, but since the default is True, maybe we can omit it. \n\nWait, the user said \"set up a new global application alert configuration\", which implies creating it, not enabling. So the create function is the right choice here. The enable function is for activating an existing config, but here they need to create it. So the correct function is create_global_application_alert_config. \n\nSo the parameters would be name: 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type: 'error_rate', threshold: 0.05, recipients: ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. The enabled is optional and defaults to True, so we can leave it out. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. Yes, name, alert_type, threshold, recipients are all there. The threshold is a float, 5% is 0.05. The recipients are an array of two emails. That should work. So the function call should be to create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters."}

The other functions are for custom event specifications and alerting channels, which don't seem relevant here. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The function expects a dictionary with \"eventId\" as the key and \"efJG9\" as the value. So the correct function call would be events_api.EventsApi.get_event with parameters {\"eventId\": \"efJG9\"}.\n\nNo other functions are needed since the user's request is straightforward.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an include_revoked boolean. The user didn't mention anything about revoked tokens, so maybe default to False. But the user wants all tokens, which might include revoked ones. Wait, but the function's description says it retrieves shareable tokens. However, the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Hmm, maybe that's not the right function.\n\nThen there's the api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens function. It has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe set include_expired to True. But the default for include_expired is False. Also, the page and page_size parameters are there. The user didn't specify page numbers, so maybe start with page 1 and page_size 20, but if there are more tokens, they might need to paginate. However, the user says \"all,\" so perhaps the function can handle that. But the function's default page is 1 and page_size is 20. If the user wants all, maybe the function can return all pages, but the user might need to handle pagination. However, the user might not know about pagination, so maybe the system should call the function with the default parameters and see. But the user might need to get all tokens, so maybe the function can be called with include_expired=True and page_size=100 if allowed. Wait, the maximum page_size is 100. So setting page_size to 100 would get more tokens per page. But the user might not know about that. However, the user is asking for all, so maybe the function should be called with include_expired=True and page_size=100. But the function's default is 20. So the assistant should call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and page_size=100. But the user's user ID is 12345. Wait, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter. Wait, looking back at the functions:\n\nThe get_api_tokens function's parameters are include_expired, page, page_size. But where is the user_id? Wait, the functions are in the list. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the functions:\n\nThe first function is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which requires user_id. The second is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, which doesn't have a user_id parameter. Wait, that's odd. How does that function know which user's tokens to retrieve? Maybe the user is authenticated, so the function doesn't need a user_id. But the user provided their user ID as 12345. Maybe the get_api_tokens function is for the current user, so the user_id is not needed. But the user is asking for their own tokens, so maybe the get_api_tokens function is the right one. However, the user provided their user ID, but the function doesn't take it. So maybe the user's user ID is not needed here. Alternatively, maybe the get_shareable_api_tokens function is for shareable tokens, which might be different from all API tokens. The user is asking for all API tokens, so maybe the get_api_tokens function is the correct one. But the user provided their user ID, but the function doesn't take it. So perhaps the user's user ID is not required for this function. Therefore, the correct function to call is get_api_tokens with include_expired=True to get all tokens, including expired ones. But the user might not know about the include_expired parameter. However, the user is asking for all tokens, so including expired ones. So the function call would be to get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the default is False, so setting it to True. Also, the page_size can be set to 100 to get more tokens per page. But the user might need to handle multiple pages. However, the user is asking for all, so maybe the function can be called with page=1 and page_size=100. But the user might not know that. However, the assistant should make the best possible call. So the correct function call is to use get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user's user ID is 12345, but that's not a parameter for this function. So maybe the user's user ID is not needed here. Therefore, the assistant should call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. Alternatively, maybe the user is authenticated, so the function doesn't need the user ID. Therefore, the correct function is get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. So the JSON would be:\n\n[{\"function\":\"api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens\",\"parameters\":{\"include_expired\":true}}]\n\nBut wait, the user provided their user ID, but the function doesn't take it. So maybe the user is authenticated, and the function is for their account. Therefore, the correct call is to use get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. That's the best possible function call here."}

The first one seems to retrieve detailed info about specific experiences or education, while the second gives a list of experiences and education. The user is asking for specific education details, so maybe 'detail_experience_and_education' is the right choice. \n\nThe parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' require the type of experience or education.

The set_alarm function is for setting an alarm at a specific time, which fits the user's request. The parameters require alarm_time and optionally purpose. The user specified the time as 7:00 AM, which can be in 12-hour format with AM/PM. The date is December 1, 2023, so the alarm_time should include that. The purpose is to wake up for a meeting.\n\nSo, the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. The purpose is 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function allows the purpose to be specified, so I'll include that. The set_countdown isn't needed here because the user is setting an alarm, not a timer.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The alarm_time is required, and the purpose is optional but relevant here. So the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time set to the specified date and time, and purpose as 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The user didn't specify the purpose, but the default is 'reminder', but since they mentioned a meeting, it's better to set the purpose accordingly."}
