The other parameters like abv_min, abv_max, ibu_min, ibu_max, pairings are optional. Since the user says \"standard\" for others, maybe we don't need to specify those.

The user provided several parameters: Parameter_fabricName, Parameter_nodeId, Parameter_podId, Parameter_interfaceType, and Parameter_infoType. These should be included in the params dictionary. Let me check the function's parameters again. The params are a dictionary of query parameters. So I need to map each of these parameters into the query parameters of the GET request.\n\nWait, the function's params parameter is a dict, so I need to structure them as key-value pairs. The user's parameters are named with underscores, like Parameter_fabricName. The API endpoint might expect these parameters in the query string. So the params dictionary should include entries like \"fabricName\": \"Network1\", \"nodeId\": \"12\", etc.\n\nPutting it all together, the URL would be constructed by replacing the placeholder in the example with the given IP. Then, the params dictionary would include all the provided parameters. I need to make sure that all the parameters are correctly mapped. The user specified the infoType as Speed, so that's part of the params.\n\nI think that's all. The function call should include the correct URL with the IP and the params dictionary with all the provided parameters. Let me structure the JSON accordingly."}

The user is looking for a housekeeper who provides ironing services in Bangkok's Chatuchak District with a 4.5 stars or higher rating. The available function is get_service_id, which retrieves a service's unique ID based on type, location, and rating.\n\nFirst, I need to map the user's request to the function's parameters. The service type here is ironing, which from the function's description corresponds to service_id 2. The province is Bangkok, which I assume has a province_id of 1. The district is Chatuchak, and the rating is 4.5. \n\nWait, the function's parameters include service_id (required), province_id (optional), district_name (optional), and rating (optional). The user's query specifies ironing services, so service_id should be 2. Province is Bangkok, which is province_id 1. District is Chatuchak, and the rating is 4.5. \n\nBut the function's parameters don't include a district_name parameter. Wait, looking back, the function does have a district_name parameter. So I can input that. The rating is 4.5, which is a float. \n\nSo the function call would be get_service_id with service_id=2, province_id=1, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the service ID for ironing in that area with the required rating. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. The user didn't mention province_id, but since they specified Bangkok, which is a province, I should include province_id=1. The district is Chatuchak, so district_name is set. The rating is 4.5, which is a float. \n\nSo the correct function call is to get_service_id with those parameters. That should get the service ID, which the user might need to proceed further.
