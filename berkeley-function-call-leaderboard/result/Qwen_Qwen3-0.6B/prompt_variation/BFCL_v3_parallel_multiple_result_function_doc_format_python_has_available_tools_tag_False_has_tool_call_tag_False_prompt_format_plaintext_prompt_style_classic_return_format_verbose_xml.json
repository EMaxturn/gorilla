There's get_sculpture_details which gets details like material and size from a museum. The get_artwork_price function retrieves the price based on size and material. \n\nThe user wants the average price, so I need to call both functions for each sculpture.

The user didn't mention any IDs, so maybe those functions aren't applicable. But the get_artwork_price function requires the sculpture_material and size.

However, the functions provided don't allow for combining the results. Each function gives individual prices. So I need to call both functions once each, then compute the average. \n\nBut the user's question doesn't specify if they want the average of the two prices or if there's a way to combine them.

But the functions don't have a way to combine them unless there's a way to retrieve both prices. \n\nWait, but the user's question is about the average price, so maybe the answer requires both individual prices. Therefore, the correct approach is to make two function calls for each sculpture, then compute the average. \n\nSo the final answer would be two function calls, each for the respective sculpture, and then the average. But since the user's question is in the context of the functions provided, I need to make sure to call the functions correctly. \n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are:\n\nFirst call: get_artwork_price with museum_location \"Museum of Philadelphia\", sculpture_material \"marble\", and sculpture_size [4,4].\n\nSecond call: get_artwork_price with museum_location \"New York museum\", sculpture_material \"bronze\", and sculpture_size [6,3].\n\nThen, average the two prices.

So, I need to call biological.calc_biomass with the energy from the first function and the efficiency.\n\nThird part: Calculate work done by the machine. The machine moves 2 meters. The work is energy multiplied by distance. So, use physical.calc_work with energy and distance. The parameters here are energy (from the first function) and distance=2.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function's parameters again.

The user provided three functions: get_events, get_monarchs, and get_culture. \n\nFor the monarchs of France in the 17th century, the function get_monarchs requires the country and century. The century here is 17, so I should call get_monarchs with country=\"France\" and century=17. The event_type is optional, so maybe leave it out unless specified.\n\nNext, major wars in England during the 18th century. The function get_events might be relevant here. The user mentioned wars, so event_type could be 'war'. The century is 18, so call get_events with country=\"England\", century=18, event_type=\"war\".\n\nLastly, art movements in Italy during the 19th century. The function get_culture is suitable here. The aspect should be 'art', the country is \"Italy\", and the century is 19. So call get_culture with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted.

They want three things: the number of all-time goals Cristiano Ronaldo scored for Manchester United in the Premier League, compare that with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition, and the top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nFirst, I need to find the functions that can help with each part. The user mentioned Manchester United, so I should use the player_stats function for the goals. The player_name is Cristiano Ronaldo, team_name is Manchester United, and competition is Premier League. That should give the all-time goals.\n\nNext, comparing with the top scorer. The top scorer for the same competition would be the one with the highest goals. But the user didn't specify which season, so maybe the default is 2019-2020. Wait, the user mentioned the 2019-2020 season, so I should use that. But how do I get the top scorer? The function might not have a direct way to get the top scorer unless there's a way to filter. Alternatively, maybe the top scorer is already the one with the highest goals, so perhaps I need to call the same function again but with the competition parameter set to the same one. But the user wants to compare the two. Hmm, maybe the first function gives the goals, and the second function gives the top scorer. But the user wants to compare, so maybe I need to get both and then compare. But the functions don't have a way to compare, so perhaps the user expects me to use the same function twice. Wait, the user's question is three separate parts. So first, get all-time goals, then get the top scorer, then get the top scorer of the same competition. But how to structure that.\n\nWait, the user's question is three parts. Let me check the functions again. The player_stats function can get all-time goals. The top scorer function is available for both team and league. So for the first part, call player_stats with player_name, team_name, competition. Then, for the second part, call the top scorer function for the same team and competition. Then, for the third part, call the top scorer function for the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season. But the user wants to compare the goals of Cristiano Ronaldo with the top scorer. So maybe the first function gives the goals, and the second function gives the top scorer. Then, compare those two. But the user's question says \"compare that with the top scorer\", so perhaps the first function gives the goals, and the second gives the top scorer, and then compare them. But how to structure that. Alternatively, maybe the top scorer is already the one with the highest goals, so the first function gives the goals, and the second function gives the top scorer. Then, the user wants to compare those two. But the user's question is three separate parts. So perhaps the answer is to call each function once for each part. Let me structure that.\n\nFirst function: player_stats with player_name, team_name, competition. Second function: get_top_scorer for the same team and competition. Third function: get_top_scorer for the Premier League in 2019-2020. Then compare the two. But the user's question is three parts. So the answer would be three function calls. Let me check the parameters again. For the first part, team_name is Manchester United, competition is Premier League. For the second part, team_name is Manchester United, competition is Premier League. For the third part, league_name is Premier League, season is 2019-2020. So the three function calls would be:\n\n1. player_stats(player_name=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\")\n2. get_top_scorer(team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\")\n3. get_top_scorer(league_name=\"Premier League\", season=\"2019-2020\")\n\nThen, the user would get the three numbers and compare them. But the user's question is three separate parts, so each function call is needed. So the final answer would be these three function calls."}

The game is still Call of Duty, platform is Xbox. So games.price.find with those parameters.\n\nThen, the reviews for FIFA 21 from America. The function games.reviews.find needs game and region. Game is FIFA 21, region is 'American'. So games.reviews.find with those arguments.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The region in the price function is optional, defaulting to global, but the user specified European and American. So I'll include them.

The dishes should not exceed 500 calories. The restaurant_search function requires ingredients, calories, and meal. The meal here is lunch, so I'll set meal to 'lunch'.\n\nThen, dinner: beef replaced with tofu, total calories under 600. The ingredient_replace function is needed here.

First, modifying the painting's attributes, then predicting the evolutionary rate of an African elephant, and finally calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker.\n\nStarting with the painting. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue. The user wants to change the size to 30x40 inches, medium to oil, and dominant color to red. So I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size should be in inches, so 30x40. Medium is oil, and dominant color is red. The function's parameters are strings, so I can input those directly.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The prediction.evolution function requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, model is Darwin. The default model is Darwin, so if not specified, it's already set, but maybe it's better to include it explicitly to avoid any issues.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The user wants the probability of a royal flush. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52 cards, favorable is 4, and round_to is 3. So I'll call calculate_probability with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly formatted.
