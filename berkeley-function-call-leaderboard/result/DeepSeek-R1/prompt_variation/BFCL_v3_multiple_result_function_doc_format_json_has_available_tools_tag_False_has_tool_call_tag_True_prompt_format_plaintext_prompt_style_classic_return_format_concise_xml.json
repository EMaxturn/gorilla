Since the game is specified and the platform (PlayStation) and region (United States) are given, we can directly use the `video_games.store_price` function to get the price in the specified store.\n\nBut note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. Since we are only checking one store (PlayStation Store) in one region (United States), the price we get from `video_games.store_price` for that game on that platform and region is the price we are looking for.\n\nHowever, note that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the selling price in the given store and region. Since we are only querying one specific store and region, the result we get is the price for that store and region. There is no mention of comparing across multiple stores or regions. Therefore, we can directly call `video_games.store_price` with the provided parameters.\n\nBut wait: what if the game is on sale? The question does not specify whether we should consider the sale price or the regular price. However, the function `video_games.store_price` should return the current selling price, which would include any discount. Therefore, we can rely on that.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider using the `video_games.on_sale` function to check if it's on sale, but the question doesn't require that. It just requires the selling price, which we can get directly.\n\nTherefore, we will call:\n  video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\nNote: The function `video_games.store_price` has a required parameter `region`? Actually, the description says: \"region: The region ... Default to United States\". So we can omit the region because the default is United States. However, to be explicit and because the question specifies the United States, we will include it.\n\nBut note: the function signature in the provided parameters for `video_games.store_price` has `region` as an optional parameter with a default of United States. Therefore, we can omit it. However, the question specifies the United States, so we can either include it or omit it. Since the default is United States, omitting it would be safe. But to be explicit, we can include it.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here, we have the parameters. We are going to provide:\n\n  game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n  platform: 'PlayStation'\n  region: 'United States'\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` requires `game_title` and `platform`. The `region` is optional and defaults to United States. So we can also call without region. However, including it is also acceptable.\n\nBut the question says \"in the United States\", so we are going to specify it.\n\nAlso note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price. We assume that the price returned is the current selling price (which might be discounted if on sale). Therefore, we don't need to check the sale status separately.\n\nSo we will make one function call.\n\nLet's write the function call in the required XML format:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n<param name=\"game_title\" type=\"string\">Assassins Creed Valhalla</param>\n<param name=\"platform\" type=\"string\">PlayStation</param>\n<param name=\"region\" type=\"string\">United States</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nHowever, note that the region parameter is optional and has a default. But since we are providing it, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, we could omit the region because the default is United States. But to be safe and explicit, we include it.\n\nBut wait: what if there are multiple editions of the game? The function `video_games.store_price` might return the price of a specific edition? The description does not specify. We are only given the game title. We assume that the function will return the price for the base game or the standard edition. If there are multiple editions, the function might return the lowest price among the editions? Or it might return the base game? The function description doesn't specify. But the question asks for the game without specifying an edition, so we assume the base game.\n\nTherefore, we proceed with the above call.\n\nBut note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. Since we are only querying one platform and one region, the price we get is the only one. However, if the same game is available in multiple editions on the same store, the function might return the base edition. But if we want the cheapest among all editions, we would need to know that. Unfortunately, the function does not specify that it returns the cheapest edition. It just returns the price for the specified game. Therefore, we assume that the function returns the price for the standard edition or the only edition if there is one.\n\nAlternatively, the function might return the lowest price among the editions? We don't know. But the problem does not specify. We must use the function as described.\n\nGiven the available functions, we cannot get the prices of all editions. Therefore, we must assume that the function returns the price of the base game.\n\nThus, we will make the call as above.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` might return multiple prices if there are multiple editions? The function description does not say. It says: \"Fetches the selling price of a specified game\". It does not specify if it returns one price or multiple. Since the return type is not specified in the function parameters, we assume it returns one price.\n\nTherefore, we call the function and return the result.\n\nHowever, if the function returns multiple editions, we would need to find the minimum. But we don't have a function for that. So we assume the function returns a single price for the base game.\n\nAlternatively, we might be overcomplicating. We are instructed to use the provided functions. We are using the one that gets the store price. We are providing the required parameters. We will do that.\n\nSo the final function call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n<param name=\"game_title\" type=\"string\">Assassins Creed Valhalla</param>\n<param name=\"platform\" type=\"string\">PlayStation</param>\n<param name=\"region\" type=\"string\">United States</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

The function expects an array of strings.\n\n But wait: the function parameters for 'sort_list' are defined as:\n   elements: array of string\n\n How do we represent an array in the XML? We can write it as a JSON array? But note the example format does not specify.\n\n The instructions say: the type must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n For an array, we can represent it as a string that is a JSON array? Or as a literal? \n\n The problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and the format is XML-like.\n\n Since the example does not show an array, we have to use a representation that is acceptable. \n\n One way is to use a JSON-like representation. For example: \n   ['Sam','Alice','Jack'] \n\n But note: the XML must be valid. We must escape any special characters? Actually, the array is a list of strings. \n We can write it as: \n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">[\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]</param>\n\n However, the original list is given without double quotes? But in the function, the array of strings is represented as strings.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent it without quotes? But that would not be valid JSON.\n\n Since the function expects an array, we can use a string that represents the array in JSON.\n\n But note: the function is implemented in Python, so it will use `ast.literal_eval` or something similar? \n We are not told how the backend will parse. We must rely on the type.\n\n Since the type is \"array\", we can represent the value as a JSON array.\n\n Therefore, we write: \n   [\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]\n\n However, the original list is given with single quotes. But JSON uses double quotes. \n\n The function expects an array of strings, so we can use double quotes as per JSON standard.\n\n Alternatively, if the function can accept single quoted string, but to be safe we use double.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax\", so it might accept both? \n However, in the function call we are passing a string that will be parsed. We should use double quotes for the array and for the strings inside.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid quotes in the array representation? That would be invalid.\n\n Let me think: the function call is being passed as a string. The backend will parse the string as an array.\n\n Since the function expects an array, we must represent the array as a string that can be parsed.\n\n The safest is to use JSON.\n\n Therefore, we represent the array as: \n   '[\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]'\n\n But wait, that would be a string. How does the backend know it's an array? \n\n The problem says that the type of the parameter is \"array\". So the backend will parse the string as an array.\n\n How? We don't know. But we are told to set the type to \"array\". So we write the value as a string that represents the array.\n\n Alternatively, the system might have a way to represent arrays in the XML without using a string? \n\n But the format says: the value is inside the tag. So we have to put a string.\n\n Therefore, we will write:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">[\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]</param>\n\n Alternatively, if the system expects a literal representation without quotes, we might do:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">[Sam, Alice, Jack]</param>\n\n But that would be ambiguous if the strings have spaces? And also, the type of the items is string, so we need to denote them as strings.\n\n Therefore, using JSON is the standard.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">[\"Sam\",\"Alice\",\"Jack\"]</param>\n\n We can remove spaces to be compact.\n\n Alternatively, the original list is given as: ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] \n We can use the same representation? But note that in XML, we are inside a tag. We don't want to break the XML.\n\n Since the values do not contain quotes or special characters, we can use single quotes and it should be fine.\n\n But to be consistent with JSON, we use double.\n\n However, the function might be implemented in Python and expect a Python list? \n\n The problem says: \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax\", so the condition and other expressions are in Python.\n\n So we can use Python's literal representation? \n\n Example: \n   ['Sam','Alice','Jack'] \n\n But note: the function call will be passed as a string. The backend will use `ast.literal_eval` to convert the string to a list.\n\n So we can write:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">['Sam','Alice','Jack']</param>\n\n But note: the array type is defined as an array of strings. And the representation above is a valid Python list of strings.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters ... must be one of: ... array\". \n\n And the value we put is a string that represents the array. \n\n Since the function is in Python, it is safe to use the Python literal representation.\n\n Therefore, we can use: \n\n   ['Sam','Alice','Jack']\n\n But note: the XML might have issues with the brackets? We are inside a tag. We don't escape the brackets because they are not XML special characters.\n\n So we write:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">['Sam','Alice','Jack']</param>\n\n Alternatively, we can use the JSON representation. But the problem does not specify.\n\n However, the function description does not specify the format of the array string. \n\n Since the function is in Python, and the condition is also in Python, it is likely that the backend expects a Python literal.\n\n Therefore, we use the Python literal.\n\n But note: the condition parameter in the filter function is a string that is a Python expression. So the backend is designed to evaluate Python expressions.\n\n So for the array, we are passing a string that will be evaluated as a Python list.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">['Sam','Alice','Jack']</param>\n\n However, the original list is exactly that.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid any representation and just pass the list as is? But we are in XML.\n\n We have to put the value as the content of the param tag.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n   <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">['Sam','Alice','Jack']</param>\n\n Now, note: the function also has an optional parameter 'order'. Since we are using the default (ascending), we can skip it.\n\n But if we want to be explicit, we can add:\n\n   <param name=\"order\" type=\"string\">asc</param>\n\n However, the function definition says the default is 'asc'. So we don't have to.\n\n But let's be explicit to match the user request? It's not necessary.\n\n We are only required to pass the required parameters. The required is only 'elements'. \n\n However, if we pass the order, it's also acceptable.\n\n But the problem says: \"the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n Here, we are not lacking any required parameters.\n\n So we can do without the order.\n\n Therefore, the function call is:\n\n   <function name=\"sort_list\">\n        <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">['Sam','Alice','Jack']</param>\n   </function>\n\n But note: the function expects the array of strings. We are passing a string that represents the list. \n\n However, the type is set to \"array\", so the backend will know to parse it.\n\n Alternatively, if the system expects the array to be passed as a string of comma separated values without brackets? \n But that is not the case because the function expects an array.\n\n We stick to the Python literal representation.\n\n Final call:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n      <functions>\n         <function name=\"sort_list\">\n            <param name=\"elements\" type=\"array\">['Sam','Alice','Jack']</param>\n         </function>\n      </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the array representation must be exactly as the function expects? \n\n Alternatively, we can test: the function is defined to take an array of strings.

Optional: frequency (string) with enum ['quarterly', 'annually'], default annually.\n   2. stock_market_data - for stock market data, which requires company and days (not relevant here).\n\n The question asks for dividend payments of Apple Inc for the last five years.\n\n We note:\n   - The company is \"Apple Inc\"\n   - The time frame is 5 years.\n\n We can use the corporate_finance.dividend_data function with:\n   company: \"Apple Inc\"\n   years: 5\n   frequency: we are not specified, so we can use the default (annually) or if we want all payments, we might choose quarterly? \n However, the question says \"historical dividend payments\", which typically includes every payment. Since the function allows quarterly, and Apple pays dividends quarterly, we should get quarterly data to see every payment.\n\n But note: the function description says \"Default annually\". However, the user did not specify frequency. We have two options:\n   - If we call without frequency, we get annual data (which might be aggregated? or the last dividend of the year? the function description does not specify). \n   - Since the question asks for payments (plural) and Apple pays quarterly, we probably want every payment. So we should set frequency to 'quarterly'.\n\n However, the function does not specify whether it returns the actual dividend payments (each event) or an annual aggregate. Since the function has a 'frequency' parameter, we can choose 'quarterly' to get every quarter.\n\n Alternatively, if the function returns annual data by default, then we would only get one data point per year. But the question says \"payments\", which implies each payment event.\n\n Therefore, I think we should set frequency to 'quarterly' to get all the dividend payments in the last five years.\n\n But note: the function parameter 'years' is the number of past years. If we set years=5 and frequency='quarterly', we should get about 20 payments (4 per year for 5 years).\n\n However, the function might return data in a way that for each year we have 4 payments? We are not sure of the exact return format, but the function is designed for dividend data.\n\n So, we will call:\n   corporate_finance.dividend_data(company=\"Apple Inc\", years=5, frequency=\"quarterly\")\n\n But note: the function parameters are required: company and years. frequency is optional.\n\n Since the user didn't specify frequency, but we want detailed payments, we choose quarterly.\n\n Alternatively, if the user only wanted annual totals, we would use annually. But the question says \"payments\", so we choose quarterly.\n\n Therefore, the function call is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"corporate_finance.dividend_data\">\n  <param name=\"company\" type=\"string\">Apple Inc</param>\n  <param name=\"years\" type=\"integer\">5</param>\n  <param name=\"frequency\" type=\"string\">quarterly</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}

Since we want \"upcoming month\", we can set this to the next month? But note the description says \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So if we leave it out, it will return upcoming events. However, the user specifically says \"upcoming month\", so we can set the month to the next month? But note the function doesn't specify the format for month. We can assume it's a string like \"May\" or \"2024-05\". Since the problem says \"upcoming month\", we can leave it as default (i.e., not provided) because the default is to return upcoming events. Alternatively, we can try to set it to the next month? But without knowing the current date, we cannot. So it's safer to rely on the default.\n\nAdditionally, we want \"top rated\", so we set `user_ratings` to 'high' (since the enum has 'low', 'average', 'high' and default is 'high'). But note: the user says \"top rated\", so we want the highest rating. The function's default for user_ratings is 'high'. So we can set it to 'high' to ensure we get the top rated.\n\nBut note: the function `find_exhibition` returns the most popular exhibitions based on the criteria. Since we are setting user_ratings to 'high', it should return exhibitions with high ratings.\n\nSo we set:\n- location: \"New York, NY\"\n- art_form: \"sculpture\"\n- month: we can omit because the default is to return upcoming events (which includes the upcoming month). Alternatively, we can set month to the next month? But we don't have a way to know the exact next month string. Since the function is designed to use the default for upcoming, we omit.\n- user_ratings: \"high\" (to get top rated)\n\nHowever, note that the user says \"modern sculpture\". The function does not have a parameter for \"modern\". How do we handle that?\n\nLooking at the function parameters, there is no direct way to specify \"modern\". We have to rely on the function's internal filtering? Or perhaps the function's description says it returns the most popular exhibitions based on criteria. Maybe the function's backend can take into account the art_form being \"sculpture\" and the location and then we can filter by modern? But the function doesn't have a parameter for era or style.\n\nSo we have two options:\n1. We call the function with art_form as \"sculpture\" and then in the response we might get a list and then we can filter for modern? But note: we are only allowed to call the provided functions. We cannot do additional filtering unless we have a function that returns the data and then we process? But the system expects function calls and then the environment will return the data. We cannot do arbitrary processing in the response.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can try to include the word \"modern\" in the art_form? For example, set art_form to \"modern sculpture\". But the function may not support that.\n\nGiven the constraints, we should stick to the parameters as defined. Since there's no way to specify \"modern\" in the function, we can only get sculpture exhibitions. We hope that the function returns modern ones if they are the most popular? Or we can note that the user asked for modern and if the function doesn't support it, we cannot fulfill that part.\n\nBut note: the function description says \"based on criteria like location, time, art form, and user ratings\". It doesn't mention style. So we have to make a trade-off. We can call the function with the available parameters and then in the next step (if we had more functions) we might filter? But we don't have a function for that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use the `get_sculpture_info` function? But that function is for retrieving an artwork by an artist, not for exhibitions.\n\nSo we proceed with `find_exhibition` and set:\n- location: \"New York, NY\"\n- art_form: \"sculpture\"\n- user_ratings: \"high\"\n\nWe omit month because the default is upcoming events (which includes the upcoming month).\n\nWe are not including the \"modern\" aspect because the function does not have a parameter for it.\n\nTherefore, we make the function call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n<param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">New York, NY</param>\n<param name=\"art_form\" type=\"string\">sculpture</param>\n<param name=\"user_ratings\" type=\"string\">high</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>"}
