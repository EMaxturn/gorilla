The example given in the function's description is something like 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So, substituting the IP, it would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nNext, the parameters. The user provided parameters: fabricName is \"Network1\", nodeId is 12, podId is 10, interfaceType is \"Ethernet\", and infoType is \"Speed\". These parameters need to be included in the params dictionary. The function's params parameter is a dict, so I need to pass these as key-value pairs.\n\nWait, the parameters in the URL might be part of the URL path or as query parameters. The example URL shows that the parameters are part of the URL path. For instance, the example URL has 'interfaceInfo' as the path part. So maybe the parameters are part of the path, not the query string. But the function's params parameter is for query parameters. Hmm, the function's description says \"the query parameters for the request.\" So perhaps the parameters are part of the query string. But the example URL given in the function's description doesn't include query parameters. Wait, the example URL is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\u2014so the path is fixed, and the parameters might be part of the path. But the function's params is for query parameters. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the user's question is about generating a RESTful API request. The Cisco Nexus Dashboard's API might have specific endpoints. The user provided the IP and API name, so the URL would be constructed with the IP and the API path. The parameters like fabricName, nodeId, podId, etc., might be part of the path or as query parameters. But the function's params is for query parameters. So perhaps the parameters are part of the URL path. However, the function's params is for query parameters. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parameters are part of the URL path. For example, the URL could be something like 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo?fabricName=Network1&nodeId=12&podId=10&interfaceType=Ethernet&infoType=Speed'. But the function's params is for query parameters, so the URL would have the parameters in the query string. However, the example URL in the function's description doesn't include query parameters, so maybe the parameters are part of the path. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, the user's question is about generating a RESTful API request. The function provided is requests.get, which requires the URL and params. The URL is the base path, and the params are the query parameters. So the user's parameters (fabricName, nodeId, etc.) would be part of the params dictionary. So the URL would be the base path, and the params would be the query parameters. Therefore, the URL would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo' and the params would be a dictionary with the parameters as key-value pairs.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nrequests.get(url='https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', params={'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'Ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'})\n\nBut I need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The params should be a dict, and the values should be correct types. The nodeId is an integer, so 12 is okay. The infoType is a string, so 'Speed' is correct. The other parameters are strings or integers as needed.\n\nSo the function call should include all the parameters provided by the user. The user's parameters are all provided, so the function call should include them. Therefore, the correct function call is to use the requests.get function with the URL and params as specified."}
