They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics function for displacement.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters provided by the user are all there: initial_speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2 decimals. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters match the function's requirements.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified the US, I don't need to adjust the region. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. \n\nWait, but the question mentions \"cheapest\". Does the function return the lowest price or the current price? The description says \"selling price\", which might just be the current price. However, since there's no other function that checks sales or discounts, maybe the store_price function will return the discounted price if it's on sale. The user might be implying that the cheapest price is the sale price. \n\nAlternatively, there's the video_games.on_sale function to check if it's on sale. But the user isn't asking if it's on sale, just the cheapest price. So maybe I should first check if it's on sale using on_sale, and if it is, then get the price from store_price. But the user wants the cheapest, which could be the sale price. However, the functions available don't mention historical prices or comparing prices. \n\nGiven the functions provided, the best approach is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region. That should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available unless there's a sale. But since the user didn't specify checking sales, maybe the store_price function is sufficient. \n\nWait, the on_sale function checks if it's on sale, but the user isn't asking about that. The question is about the cheapest price. So perhaps the store_price function returns the price, which could be lower if it's on sale. Therefore, calling store_price with the given parameters should provide the current price, which might be the cheapest. \n\nSo the correct function to call is video_games.store_price with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', and region 'United States'. The region is optional and defaults to US, but since the user specified it, we include it. \n\nI don't need to call any other functions because the store_price function should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available at the moment. The on_sale function isn't necessary here unless the user wanted to confirm if it's on sale, which they didn't. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be to store_price with the specified parameters."}

The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which requires distance and time, and initial_speed is optional with a default of 0. \n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. The parameters needed are distance and time. The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (default 0). The user's input matches those parameters. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. That should give the final speed. \n\nI don't need to use calculate_acceleration here because the question is directly asking for the speed, not the acceleration.

All the required parameters are provided in the question: 2 moles and 300 K for the first, 3 moles and 400 K for the second. So I should call that function with these values.

Since 'currently' isn't an option, maybe the default is 'Daily'. But the user might mean the latest trend, so perhaps 'Monthly' or 'Yearly'. However, the function's default for period is 'Daily' according to the parameters. Wait, the description says the default is 'Daily'? Let me check again. The parameters for paint_color.trends: period has a default of 'Daily'. So if the user wants the current trend, maybe 'Daily' is the right choice. But 'Daily' might not make sense for paint color trends. Maybe the user intended 'Monthly' or 'Yearly'.
