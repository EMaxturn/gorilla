The function parameters are for a single food_name, so I'll have to make multiple calls.\n\nLet me break down the foods:\n\nFrom the first part:\n\n- Frozen mango: 8 pieces\n\n- Chai tea: No specific amount given, so I might need to assume or skip if not enough info.\n\nFrom the second part:\n\n- Two slices of pepperoni pizza\n\n- A coffee: No specific amount.\n\nThe function requires: food_name, portion_amount, and portion_unit.\n\nFor each food:\n\n1.

For those that don't, I shouldn't call it.\n\nSo, for frozen mango and pepperoni pizza, I have enough info.\n\nFor chai tea and coffee, I don't.\n\nI need to make function calls for the ones I can.\n\nThe user might expect me to log all, but I have to stick to what's possible.\n\nMeal_type and log_date have defaults, so I don't need to specify them unless provided.\n\nThe user didn't specify meal_type or dates, so I'll use defaults.\n\nPossible calls:\n\n1.
