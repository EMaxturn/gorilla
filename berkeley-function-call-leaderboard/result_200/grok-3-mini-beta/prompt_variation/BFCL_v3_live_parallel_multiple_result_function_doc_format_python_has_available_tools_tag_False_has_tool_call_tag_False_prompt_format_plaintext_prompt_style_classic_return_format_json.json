The system prompt says I can make one or more function calls in a single response, formatted as a JSON array.\n\nSo, I should call get_news_report twice: once for each location.\n\nFirst call: For Paris, France, category='General' (default), language='en' (default).\n\nSecond call: For Letterkenny, Ireland, category='Technology', language='en' (default).\n\nIn the function description: \"location (str): The location for which to get the news, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'San Francisco, CA'. State needs to be in short form. If state not available in use 'City, Country'\"\n\nFor Paris, France: No state, so 'Paris, France' is fine.\n\nFor Letterkenny, Ireland: No state, so 'Letterkenny, Ireland' is appropriate.\n\nI need to format my response as:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{\"param1\":\"value1\", ...}},\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name2\",\"parameters\":{...}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSpecifically for this:\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"get_news_report\", \"parameters\":{\"location\":\"Paris, France\", \"category\":\"General\", \"language\":\"en\"} },\n\n{\"function\":\"get_news_report\", \"parameters\":{\"location\":\"Letterkenny, Ireland\", \"category\":\"Technology\", \"language\":\"en\"} }\n\n]\n\nSince category and language have defaults, I could omit them if they are default values. But to be precise, the user specified English, and for the second one, technology, so I'll include them for clarity.\n\nThe function allows defaults, but in the call, I should only include what's necessary. However, since the prompt doesn't specify, and to match exactly, I'll include them as per the user's request.\n\nFor the first one, category is default, so I can omit it. Language is default, so omit.\n\nFor the second, category is 'Technology', so include that.\n\nTo keep it minimal: For Paris, just specify location.\n\nFor Letterkenny, specify location and category.\n\nThe response format requires me to put exactly what's needed.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here, all required parameters are present.\n\nRequired is only location.

It takes:\n\n   - skill (str): The skill for which to find qualified interviewers.\n\n   - experience_level (str, default='Mid-Level')\n\n   - availability (bool, default=True)\n\n   This seems relevant, but it's designed for one skill at a time. The user mentioned two skills: Python and Java.\n\n2. **review_of_interviewer**: This is for getting reviews of a specific interviewer, not for listing them. So, it's not applicable here.\n\nThe function get_interviewer_list only accepts one skill. The user is asking for interviewers qualified in both Python and Java, which might imply an intersection of skills. However, the function doesn't support multiple skills in a single call.\n\nI need to handle this. The instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But more importantly, I should only return function calls in the specified format, or point out if none can be used.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But it also specifies to only return function calls in the JSON format, and not include any other text.\n\nRe-reading the prompt: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ```json ... ```. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I can't use any functions, I need to point it out, but the prompt doesn't specify how. However, it says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" And earlier: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis might be a conflict. To be safe, I should try to make the best use of available functions.\n\nPossible approaches:\n\n- Call get_interviewer_list for Python first.\n\n- Then, call it for Java.\n\n- But the user wants a list for both, which might mean interviewers who have both skills. The function doesn't support that directly.\n\nThe function is for a specific skill, so I might need to call it twice and then somehow combine, but I can't combine them; I just output function calls.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I could output multiple function calls in one response.\n\nIn the format: ```json [ {\"function\":\"func_name1\", ...}, {\"function\":\"func_name2\", ...} ] ```\n\nI can call get_interviewer_list twice: once for Python and once for Java.\n\nThat way, I provide lists for both skills.\n\nIf the user meant interviewers with both skills, I can't do that with the available functions, so I'll assume they want lists for each.\n\nThe question: \"interviewers list for Python and Java\" \u2013 it's ambiguous, but likely means for each.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with calling the function for each skill.\n\nParameters for get_interviewer_list:\n\n- skill: I'll use 'Python' for one and 'Java' for the other.\n\n- experience_level: Default is 'Mid-Level', so I don't have to specify.\n\n- availability: Default is True, so okay.\n\nMy response should be in the exact format:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n    {\"function\": \"get_interviewer_list\", \"parameters\": {\"skill\": \"Python\"}},\n\n    {\"function\": \"get_interviewer_list\", \"parameters\": {\"skill\": \"Java\"}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nThat seems appropriate.\n\nI don't need to specify other parameters since they have defaults.\n\nFinally, once I output this, the system will handle the calls and proceed."}

Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to map these steps to the available functions.\n\nAvailable functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This matches step 1. It takes repo_url, and optional parameters like destination, recursive, depth.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It analyzes the repo and determines the predominant language.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This can be used for step 2.1. It generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This can be used for step 2.2. It generates Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for step 4, which includes committing and pushing. It automatically git adds all changes, so that covers step 3 as well.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, it handles step 3 implicitly.\n\nThe order is important. I need to call functions in sequence because some depend on others.\n\nFirst, clone the repo.\n\nThen, analyze the contents.\n\nAfter analysis, create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML.\n\nFinally, push the changes.\n\nThe functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML don't directly take analysis results as input. I have to assume that once I call analyse_repo_contents, the system will handle the results for the next steps, or I need to call them sequentially.\n\nIn this setup, I just need to output the function calls in order.\n\nThe user says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose. At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nIt also says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nSo, I might need to output multiple function calls in one response, as per the format: a JSON array of function calls.\n\nThe format is: ```json [ {\"function\":\"func_name1\", ...}, {\"function\":\"func_name2\", ...} ] ```\n\nI can list them in sequence.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file, they require directory_name, which should be the repo directory.\n\nFrom clone_repo, the repo will be cloned to a destination, default '.'.\n\nI need to specify the directory for subsequent calls.\n\nAssuming the repo is cloned to '.', then directory_name for others would be '.' or the repo name.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so probably the directory will be 'nodejs-welcome' or something, but in clone_repo, if destination is not specified, it's '.' , but typically Git clones into a subdirectory.\n\nTo be precise, in clone_repo, destination defaults to '.', which might mean it clones into the current directory, possibly creating a subdirectory.\n\nFor safety, I should use the repo name as directory_name.\n\nIn the functions, for analyse_repo_contents, it takes directory_name as \"The name of the directory where the repository is located.\"\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor clone_repo, I need to provide repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\nI can set destination to, say, 'nodejs-welcome', to make it clear.\n\nThe function description: \"destination (str, default='.'): The local file system path where the repository should be cloned to.\"\n\nSo, if I set destination to 'nodejs-welcome', it will clone into that directory.\n\nThen, for other functions, I can use 'nodejs-welcome' as directory_name.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with repo_url and perhaps destination.\n\n2. Call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\n3. Call create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. Call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name and other defaults.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has more parameters, but I can use defaults.\n\n5. Call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and other parameters.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github will automatically git add all changes, so that covers adding files.\n\nIt needs commit_message, branch_name, etc.\n\nThe user didn't specify, so I can use defaults.\n\nIn the function, commit_message defaults to 'Update changes', branch_name to 'main'.\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nOne potential issue: create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file are based on the analysis, but in my calls, I'm not passing the analysis results. I assume that the system handles that, or perhaps the functions internally use the latest analysis.\n\nSince the tools are separate, I'll just call them in order.\n\nFinally, output in the specified JSON format.\n\nSo, my response should be a JSON array of these function calls.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFirst: clone_repo\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"clone_repo\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\",\n\n\"destination\": \"nodejs-welcome\"  // I'll set this for clarity\n\n}\n\n}\n\nSecond: analyse_repo_contents\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThird: create_a_docker_file\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\nFourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n  // Other parameters can use defaults, so I don't have to specify\n\n}\n\n}\n\nFifth: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\",\n\n  // commit_message, branch_name can default\n\n}\n\n}\n\nI think that's all.\n\nThe user said \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\", but the function is just \"create_a_docker_file\", which generates one. I'll assume it handles updating if needed.\n\nSame for Kubernetes.\n\nAlright, so in my response, I'll output this as a JSON array."}

It requires class_name and method_name, and optionally include_private.\n\n- get_relevant_classes: Retrieves a list of class names that potentially match a search string. It requires search_string, and optionally case_sensitive and include_subdirectories.\n\n- get_imports: Analyzes code for suggested imports.\n\nFor the first request: Find relevant classes related to 'CellResult'.\n\nThis matches get_relevant_classes, where I can use 'CellResult' as the search_string. The user specified to include subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True.\n\nFor the second request: Provide signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nThis matches get_signature.

The user mentioned \"music concerts or theater plays\", so I could use something like \"concert\" or \"play\". The function description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so I need to specify one. It might be best to choose one, but the user said \"any\", so perhaps I can use \"concert\" as an example.\n\n- city (str): The name of the city. User said \"Los Angeles\", and it should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so that would be 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- date (str, default='any'): The date of the event, formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. User specified \"March 10th, 2023\", which is '2023-03-10'.\n\nI have all the necessary parameters:\n\n- event_type: I need to decide. The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\". The function might accept \"concert\" or \"play\". Since it's \"or\", I could call it once for concerts and once for plays, but the instructions say to try to complete in the current turn. However, to keep it simple, I'll assume I need to call it for one type. Maybe start with \"concert\".\n\nThe function is for cultural events, and event_type is a string like the category. I should use \"concert\" for music concerts.\n\n- city: 'Los Angeles, CA'\n\n- date: '2023-03-10'\n\nI can make a function call to Events_3_FindEvents with these parameters.\n\nThe user said \"any music concerts or theater plays\", so ideally, I might want to search for both. But the function call is for one event_type at a time. To fully answer, I should make two calls: one for \"concert\" and one for \"play\".\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" And \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nIn the response format, I can include multiple function calls in one response, as it's a list: ```json [ {\"function\": \"...\"}, {\"function\": \"...\"} ] ```\n\nSo, I can call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once with event_type=\"concert\" and once with event_type=\"play\".\n\nThat way, I cover both.\n\nFinally, format the response as a JSON array of function calls.\n\nResponse format:\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n{\"function\":\"func_name1\",\"parameters\":{\"param1\":\"value1\"}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSo, for this:\n\nFirst call: {\"function\": \"Events_3_FindEvents\", \"parameters\": {\"event_type\": \"concert\", \"city\": \"Los Angeles, CA\", \"date\": \"2023-03-10\"}}\n\nSecond call: {\"function\": \"Events_3_FindEvents\", \"parameters\": {\"event_type\": \"play\", \"city\": \"Los Angeles, CA\", \"date\": \"2023-03-10\"}}\n\nThat should work."}
