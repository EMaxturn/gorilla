The user wants to calculate the displacement of a car. The initial speed is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, and the time is 5 seconds. The question mentions straight line motion, so I should use the kinematics function.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_displacement which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The parameters are all required except rounding. The user didn't specify rounding, so I can leave it out. So I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. That should give the displacement. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here since the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with those parameters."}

There's the video_games.on_sale function, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which fetches the selling price. The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might show if it's on sale, but the user is asking for the cheapest price. However, the store_price function gives the current price, which might be the cheapest. But maybe there's a sale price that's lower. But the question is about the cheapest selling price, so perhaps the store_price function is the one to use.\n\nThe parameters required for store_price are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call video_games.store_price with those parameters. The region is optional, but since the user specified United States, I should include it. So the function call would be store_price with those parameters. The on_sale function might not be necessary here because the user is asking for the price, not if it's on sale. So the correct function to call is store_price."}

The user is asking to find out the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about finding the final speed.\n\nThe formula that relates distance, initial speed, final speed, and time is: \ndistance = (initial_speed * time) + (0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2). \nBut since initial_speed is 0, it simplifies to distance = 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. \nSolving for acceleration would give acceleration = 2 * distance / time\u00b2. \nThen, final speed can be found using v = u + at, where u is initial speed (0), so v = a * t. \n\nBut wait, the user might be expecting the use of a specific function. Looking at the available functions, there's \"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\" which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function's parameters are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). \n\nSo, the parameters here are distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. The function should compute the speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But the user isn't asking for acceleration but speed. So the correct function is calculate_speed_from_rest. \n\nI need to check if the parameters are correctly provided. The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds. The function requires distance and time as integers. The initial_speed is 0, which is optional. So the function call should include distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

So the formula should be (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by (quantity1 + quantity2). \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check the parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided all four values: 2 moles, 300 K, 3 moles, 400 K.

The parameters for sort_list include 'elements' which is required, and an optional 'order' parameter. The user specified ascending order, so the order should be 'asc'.\n\nThe elements given are ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack']. Sorting them in ascending order would arrange them alphabetically.

The required parameters are desired_sum, sides_per_die, and n_rolls. The user is asking for a sum of 7, so desired_sum is 7. The default for n_rolls is 1, which is correct because they're rolling two dice. Wait, but the function's n_rolls parameter is for the number of dice. Wait, the description says \"number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\". So if they're rolling two dice, n_rolls should be 2. But the function's default is 1. So I need to set n_rolls to 2. The sides_per_die is usually 6 for standard dice. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6.\n\nThe other functions don't apply here.
