I need to make it accurate. Probably: conditions=['age > 25', 'job = \\'engineer\\'']\n\nI should use proper string formatting. In Python, for a string array, it would be a list like ['age > 25', 'job = \\'engineer\\''].\n\nThe user said: \"Find records in database in user table where age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'.\"\n\nThis matches exactly with what database_query can do.\n\nI don't think I need any other functions; this should suffice.\n\nOnce I call this function, if that's all, the system will handle the rest. But the instructions say: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nIn this case, one function call should fulfill it.\n\nFinally, if I invoke a function, my response should ONLY be in that format, no other text.\n\nSo, my response should be: [database_query(table='user', conditions=['age > 25', 'job = \\'engineer\\''])]\n\nI need to make sure about the conditions format. Is it an array of strings? Probably yes.\n\nIn the function definition, it's \"conditions (array): Conditions for the query.\" So, I'll go with that."}

The function description doesn't specify. In many financial calculations, yield is given as a decimal, like 0.05 for 5%. However, the docstring says \"5% annual yield\", but in the parameter, it's just \"annual_yield (float)\". To be safe, I'll assume it's 5 for 5%, as that's how it's commonly input in such functions. Wait, no, let's think: in the human's message, it's \"5% annual yield\", and the function likely expects the rate as a percentage or as a decimal? The docstring doesn't clarify, but in code, for compound interest, it's usually decimal. Actually, upon second thought, in the function description: \"annual_yield (float): The annual yield rate of the fund.\" and in examples, it's often decimal. But to match the human's input, I'll use 0.05.\n\nWait, hold on: the human said \"5% annual yield\", so probably the function expects 5, meaning 5%, or 0.05. I need to check the function's logic, but since it's not specified, I'll go with what's common. In the function name and description, it's \"annual_yield\", and in finance, functions like this often take it as a decimal. For example, in compound interest formula, it's (1 + r)^t where r is 0.05.\n\nBut looking back at the docstring: \"Calculate the final balance of a mutual fund investment based on the total initial investment, annual yield rate and the time period.\"\n\nI think it's safer to assume it's a decimal, so 0.05 for 5%.\n\nWait, no, in the human's message: \"5% annual yield\", and in the function, it's called \"annual_yield\", which might expect the percentage as is. This is ambiguous. To be precise, I'll check if there's a standard. Actually, in the function's pass statement, it's not helpful. Perhaps I should use 5.0, and let the function handle it.\n\nWait, another way: in the docstring example, it's not specified, but in code, for accuracy, I'll use 0.05.\n\nUpon reflection, in most programming examples, like Python's financial calculations, it's decimal. For instance, numpy or math libraries use decimal rates.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about the function: if it's calculating balance, likely using compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^t, where r is 0.05.\n\nSo, I'll use annual_yield as 0.05.\n\nFinally, my response should be just the function call in the specified format.\n\nSo: [calculate_mutual_fund_balance(investment_amount=50000, annual_yield=0.05, years=3)]\n\nThat seems correct."}

What should the dict look like?

Default is 6 for standard six-faced die.\"\n\nSince it's defaulting to 6, I can omit it.\n\nThe response format requires: If I decide to invoke the function, I MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\n\nAnd nothing else in the response.\n\nAfter calling this function, if that's all that's needed, I should stop. The system will handle the next steps.\n\nThe user asked to \"Calculate the odds\", and this function will do that. So, I just need to call this function.\n\nIs there anything missing? The question has all the parameters: number=7, dice_number=2.\n\nI should return the function call in the specified format.\n\nFinal function call: [monopoly_odds_calculator(number=7, dice_number=2)]\n\nI don't need to include dice_faces since it's default.\n\nResponse should be exactly in that format, no extra text."}

In the code, it's categories='', which is a string, but the description says array. I need to treat it as per the docstring.\n\nIn the function signature: def grocery_store_find_nearby(location, categories=''):\n\nIt says categories='', which is a string default, but the docstring says \"categories (array)\".

In the function def, it's categories='', which is a string, but docstring says array. In Python, when calling, I can pass a list, and it might handle it.\n\nTo be precise, perhaps I should check if the function expects a string.

{"id": "simple_399", "result": "[restaurant_search(location='New York City, NY', cuisine='Italian', rating=4, accepts_credit_cards=True)]", "input_token_count": 313, "output_token_count": 25, "latency": 8.089685916900635, "reasoning_content": "First, the user is asking to find the best Italian restaurants in New York City with an average customer rating of more than 4 and that accept credit cards.\n\nI have a function available: restaurant_search. Let me check its parameters:\n\n- location: string, e.g., New York City, NY\n\n- cuisine: string, e.g., Italian\n\n- rating: integer, minimum average customer rating out of 5\n\n- accepts_credit_cards: boolean, true or false\n\nThe user's request matches perfectly:\n\n- Location: New York City, NY (I need to use the full format as in the example)\n\n- Cuisine: Italian\n\n- Rating: More than 4, so the minimum rating should be 5? Wait, no. The function takes an integer for minimum average rating. If they want more than 4, that could be 4.1 and up, but since it's out of 5 and the parameter is an integer, I need to interpret this.\n\nThe function description says: \"rating (integer): Minimum average customer rating out of 5\". So, if they say more than 4, I should set it to 5, because ratings are likely whole numbers or the function expects the floor. But actually, customer ratings can be decimals, but the parameter is an integer, so probably it means at least that integer value.\n\nFor example, if rating=4, it means 4.0 and above. But the user said \"more than 4\", which might mean greater than 4, like 4.1+. Since the function takes an integer, setting it to 4 would include 4.0, which is not more than 4. This is ambiguous.\n\nThe function likely interprets rating as \"at least this rating\", so for \"more than 4\", I should set it to 5 if it's strictly greater than 4, but that might not be accurate. The user said \"average customer ratings of more than 4\", and the function's rating is \"Minimum average customer rating\", which implies >= that value.\n\nTo be precise, if they want more than 4, and ratings are out of 5, probably they mean >4, so at least 4.1, but since the function takes an integer, I have to choose 4 or 5. I think the safest is to use 4, as it will return restaurants with 4 and above, and the user can filter further if needed. But the function might return exactly 4, which is not more than 4.\n\nThe function description: \"rating (integer): Minimum average customer rating out of 5\". So, if I set rating=4, it means minimum 4.0. But \"more than 4\" means >4.0.\n\nThis is a problem. Perhaps I should assume that the function will handle it as >= the integer, and since the user said \"more than 4\", I might need to set it to 5. But that could exclude good restaurants that are 4.5, wait no.\n\nIf I set rating=5, it would only return 5.0 and above. If I set rating=4, it returns 4.0 and above.\n\nThe user wants more than 4, so perhaps 4.1 and above. But I can't specify 4.1; it's an integer.\n\nI think I have to make a decision. In practice, for such tools, setting it to 4 would be closest, as the user might mean at least 4, but they said \"more than 4\". However, to follow literally, perhaps I should not call the function if it doesn't match exactly.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used or the given question lacks the parameters, return an empty list then explain.\"\n\nDoes it lack parameters? No, I have all: location, cuisine, rating, accepts_credit_cards.\n\nFor rating, I need to provide an integer. I'll interpret \"more than 4\" as at least 5, but that seems wrong. Perhaps use 4 and let the function handle it.\n\nAnother way: the function might expect the minimum as an integer, so for >4, I could use 5 if it's whole numbers, but ratings are averages, so likely decimals.\n\nI should just use 4, as it's the closest.\n\nPerhaps the best is to call it with rating=4, since \"more than 4\" isn't precisely mappable, but it's the intent.\n\n- Accepts credit cards: Yes, so boolean true.\n\nSo, I can call: restaurant_search(location=\"New York City, NY\", cuisine=\"Italian\", rating=4, accepts_credit_cards=True)\n\nI think that's reasonable.\n\nNow, the response format: If I decide to invoke the function, I MUST put it in the format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nAnd nothing else in the response.\n\nSo, for this, my response should be just: [restaurant_search(location='New York City, NY', cuisine='Italian', rating=4, accepts_credit_cards=True)]\n\nAfter this, if needed, the system will handle the next steps.\n\nI think that's it for this turn."}
