That sounds right because it starts from rest. Let me check the parameters. It requires distance and time, and optionally initial speed. Since it starts from rest, initial speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that. The parameters are distance (20 meters) and time (4 seconds). So I can call this function with those values. The function should calculate the final speed using the formula for constant acceleration. The formula for speed when starting from rest is v = 2d/t, maybe? Or maybe using the equations of motion.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when two different quantities of the same gas at different temperatures are mixed. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to approach this. Since the gases are the same, their molar masses are the same, so maybe that's not a factor here. When mixing gases, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. The heat lost by the warmer gas should equal the heat gained by the cooler gas. But wait, since they are the same gas, the specific heat capacity would be the same for both. So the formula would be something like (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2), where n is the number of moles. That makes sense because the total internal energy is the sum of each quantity times their temperature, divided by the total quantity.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: 2 moles, 300 K, 3 moles, 400 K.

The default for sides_per_die is probably 6 since that's standard for dice. Wait, but the function's parameters say that n_rolls has a default of 1, but in this case, we need two dice. So I need to set n_rolls to 2. The sides_per_die is required, so I should specify 6. Let me make sure. The possible combinations for two six-sided dice that add up to 7 are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). That's 6 outcomes. Total possible outcomes are 6*6=36. So probability is 6/36 = 1/6.

The month is \"upcoming,\" which might correspond to the next month. The user also mentioned \"top rated,\" so I should set the user_ratings parameter to something like 'high' or 'top'. \n\nWait, the parameters for find_exhibition have art_form as required. The example given for art_form is \"sculpture,\" but the user said \"modern sculpture.\" Maybe I should use \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form value. However, the function might expect a specific category. If \"modern sculpture\" is too specific, maybe just \"sculpture\" would work, but the user did specify \"modern,\" so it's better to include that. \n\nThe month parameter is optional, and the default is upcoming events. Since the user says \"upcoming month,\" maybe we can leave it as default or specify the next month. But the function's month parameter description says the default returns upcoming events, so maybe we can omit it. However, the user specifically mentions \"upcoming month,\" so perhaps setting month to the next month's name would be better. But since the default is already upcoming, maybe it's redundant. \n\nUser ratings: the default is 'high', but the user wants \"top rated,\" so maybe setting user_ratings to 'top' or 'high' depending on what the function accepts.

If the function expects a specific value like \"sculpture,\" then \"modern sculpture\" might not be recognized. But the user's query is about modern sculpture, so maybe the function can handle that. Alternatively, maybe the art_form should be \"sculpture\" and another parameter for the style, but since that's not an option here, I'll proceed with \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form. \n\nSo the function call would be find_exhibition with location=\"New York\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", and user_ratings=\"high\". The month can be omitted since the default is upcoming. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let's check the parameters again. The required parameters are location and art_form.
