First, they want to clone a Git repository from GitHub. The command given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url, which is provided, and the destination is the current working directory by default, so I don't need to specify that. So the first function call should be clone_repo with repo_url set to that GitHub URL.\n\nNext, the user wants to analyse the repo contents and create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files. The analyse_repo_contents function is needed for the analysis part. Once that's done, the next steps are to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory name, which I assume is the same as the repo directory. Similarly, create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory name. But wait, the user mentioned \"based on the analysis,\" so after analysing, those functions should be called. However, the user's steps mention 2.1 and 2.2, so I need to make sure those two function calls are made after the analysis.\n\nThen, the user wants to add all changed files to Git and commit/push. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, which I think is the same as the repo directory. The commit message and branch name can be left as defaults unless specified. So after creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML, the push function should be called with the directory name and any other parameters.\n\nWait, but the user's steps are in order: clone, analyse, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAML, add changes, commit. So the order of function calls is important. Let me check each step again.\n\nFirst, clone_repo with the given URL. Then, analyse_repo_contents. Then, create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file. Then, push_git_changes_to_github. So each step is a separate function call. The parameters for each function are as per their required fields. For example, in create_a_docker_file, the directory_name is needed, which I assume is the same as the repo directory. The default is '.' if not provided, but since the user mentioned the repo, maybe the directory_name is the same as the repo's path. So the parameters for each function should be set accordingly.\n\nI need to make sure that all required parameters are included. For example, in the analyse_repo_contents function, the directory_name is required. So after calling that, the next steps are to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML. Then, push the changes. So the final step is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name and any other parameters. The commit message and branch name can be left as defaults unless specified, which they are in the problem statement.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function calls should be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='.')\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files to Git and committing. The push function's parameters include directory_name, which is the same as the repo directory. So that's covered. The commit message and branch name can be left as default. So the final function call is push_git_changes_to_github with those parameters.\n\nI think that's all. Each step is a separate function call, and all required parameters are provided."}

The functions provided are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe user is asking for relevant classes related to 'CellResult'. The get_relevant_classes function seems appropriate here. The parameters required are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult'. The case sensitivity is default false, so it's case-insensitive. Including subdirectories is default false, so maybe the user needs to check if that's the case.

The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. The method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The class is 'AbstractCellHandler'. So I need to call get_signature with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned overriding methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function would retrieve the signatures of the methods in that class.

Since 5 cm is 0.05 meters, but the function expects a float, maybe the input is already in centimeters. Wait, the function's parameter is a float, so if the user says 5 cm, that's 5.0.
