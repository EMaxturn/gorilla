The loc format is 'Street Address, City, State', which the user provided. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes. So uber.ride seems suitable.\n\nThe second function, uber.ride2, also requires loc and type, but the loc format is 'City, State', but the user gave a full address. Also, time is optional with a default of 10. But since the user specified 10 minutes, maybe it's okay. However, the first function's loc matches the user's input exactly. So better to use uber.ride here.\n\nWait, the parameters for uber.ride2 have loc as 'City, State', but the user's address is more detailed.

The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits and withdrawals. Also, they want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems perfect here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview needs total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date.\n\nThe user provided all the necessary details: bank is U.S. Bank, account number is 1-523-1713-5704, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The dates are October 1 to 31, 2019. Deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40. The balances are given but the function's parameters don't include them, so maybe they're not needed here. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview doesn't have starting or ending balance, just dates and totals. The user also mentioned including a summary of transactions. But the function's parameters don't include individual transactions, just the overview. However, the user might need the transaction_summary.generate function for that. But the question is to provide an overview, which might be covered by BankStatementOverView. \n\nWait, the user says \"overview\" which includes the account info and summary, and also \"include a summary of transactions\". The BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview parameter is a dict with total deposits, withdrawals, start and end dates. The transaction_summary.generate function would include individual transactions. But the user hasn't provided specific transactions, only totals. \n\nSince the user hasn't given individual transactions, maybe the transaction_summary.generate isn't needed here. The BankStatementOverView can be used to create the overview with the provided totals. The user might not need the detailed transactions since they didn't list them. So the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. The transaction_overview includes the totals and dates. The starting and ending balances are provided but not part of the function's parameters, so they might be omitted unless there's another function. \n\nSo the answer should be a call to BankStatementOverView with the parameters as specified."}

The key parameters here are the city, which is Noida, and the date, which is today. The function I need to use here is get_movies. \n\nFirst, check the required parameters for get_movies. The city is required, and the user provided that. The date is optional but the user mentioned \"today,\" so I should use today's date in India. The default for movie_date is None, but since the user specified today, I need to set that. The other parameters like cinema_hall, movie_language, and movie_format are optional. The user didn't mention any specific cinema hall, language, or format, so I can leave those as default or omit them.\n\nWait, the system note says to default the movie date to today's date in India if not provided. So even though the user said \"today,\" I should calculate that date. But the function's parameter expects a string in DD-MM-YYYY format. Let me confirm today's date in India. Assuming today is 2023-10-05, but since I don't have real-time data, maybe the system will handle it. But the user's query is straightforward. The function call should include city='Noida' and movie_date as today's date. Since the user didn't specify cinema hall, language, or format, those can be omitted or set to default. The default for movie_format is '2D', but since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to not include it unless needed. However, the function's parameters have defaults, so maybe leaving them out is okay. \n\nSo the function call would be get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date='DD-MM-YYYY'). Wait, but I need to replace 'DD-MM-YYYY' with the actual current date. However, as an AI, I can't compute the current date dynamically. The user's instruction says to consider the movie date as today's date in India. So perhaps the system will handle that, but in the function call, I need to pass the date. But since I don't have access to real-time data, maybe the user expects the assistant to use today's date. However, in the absence of actual date computation, maybe the assistant should just pass the parameter as 'today' or the correct format. Wait, no, the parameters require a string in DD-MM-YYYY. So perhaps the assistant should use the current date. But since I can't compute that, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the current date, but in the function call, it's up to the system to handle. Wait, the user's instruction says to default the movie date to current date in India. So in the function call, I should set movie_date to today's date. But how to represent that? Since I can't compute it here, maybe the assistant is supposed to use the current date. However, in the example, the assistant would need to generate the correct date. But since I don't have access to real-time data, perhaps the assistant should just pass the parameter as today's date, assuming that the system will handle it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should leave it as default, but the user specified \"today,\" so it's better to include it. \n\nIn any case, the required parameters are city, which is provided. The movie_date is optional but the user specified today, so include it. The other parameters can be omitted. So the function call would be get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date='DD-MM-YYYY'). But the actual date needs to be filled. However, since I can't compute it, maybe the assistant is supposed to use the current date. But in the absence of that, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the parameters as given, and the system will handle the date. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should ask the user for the date, but the user said \"today,\" so it's implied. \n\nI think the correct approach is to call get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date set to today's date in the correct format. Since I can't compute the actual date, but the user's instruction says to default to today's date, the assistant should pass the date parameter as today's date. However, without knowing the exact date, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the parameters as per the user's instruction. Therefore, the function call would be get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date='DD-MM-YYYY'), but the actual date would be filled by the system. Alternatively, maybe the assistant is supposed to use the current date, but since I can't compute it, I'll proceed with the parameters as per the user's input, assuming that the system will handle the date. \n\nSo the final function call is get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date='DD-MM-YYYY'). But since the user said \"today,\" maybe the assistant should use the current date. However, without knowing the exact date, perhaps the assistant should just pass the parameter as today's date, and the system will handle it. Therefore, the correct function call is get_movies(city='Noida', movie_date='DD-MM-YYYY'), but the actual date would be filled in by the system. Alternatively, maybe the assistant is supposed to use the current date, but since I can't compute it, I'll proceed with the parameters as given."}

The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate priced, which in the function's enum is 'moderate'. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. The user didn't specify the state, but since it's New York, maybe it's 'New York, NY'. The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it as default or check if it's required. Wait, the required parameters are category and location. Oh, the user didn't mention a specific cuisine, so maybe I need to use a default or general category. Wait, the category is required, so I have to pick one. But the user didn't specify. Hmm, maybe the function allows a general category, but looking at the enum, there's no 'any' option. So perhaps the user's query is missing the category. But the user didn't mention it. Wait, the original query says \"intermediate priced\" and \"outdoor seating in New York\". Maybe the category isn't specified, but the function requires it. So maybe I need to ask the user for the category. But the user hasn't provided that. Wait, the problem says if required parameters are missing, indicate that. So in this case, the category is required, but the user didn't specify. So I should point out that the category is missing. But the user might have intended to search without a specific category, but the function requires it. Alternatively, maybe the category can be left as a default? Wait, looking at the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the 'category' is required, and there's no default. So the user's query is missing the 'category' parameter. Therefore, I can't proceed without that. But the user might not know the category. So the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. However, maybe the user intended to search for any category, but the function doesn't allow that. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the category is required. But according to the instructions, if required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this. So the answer would be that the 'category' parameter is missing. However, the user's message says \"intermediate priced\" which maps to price_range='moderate', and has_seating_outdoors=True, location='New York, NY'. But category is required. So the function call can't be made without it. Therefore, the correct response is to note that the category is missing. But the user didn't mention it. So the assistant should respond that the category is required. However, the user might not have provided it. Therefore, the function call can't be generated. Wait, but the user's query is to \"find some restaurants\" without specifying the cuisine. Maybe the assistant should ask for clarification. But according to the problem statement, if required parameters are missing, indicate that. So the answer would be that the 'category' parameter is missing. Therefore, the function call can't be made.

The available function is Music_3_LookupMusic. The parameters for this function include artist, album, genre, and year. Since the user mentioned the album name, I should set the album parameter to 'The New Classic'. The other parameters like artist, genre, and year can be left as default ('dontcare') unless specified. But wait, the user didn't mention the artist or genre, so those should stay as 'dontcare'. However, the function's parameters have defaults set to 'dontcare', so maybe just specifying the album is enough.\n\nNext, the second part is tracks released around six years ago. Since the current year is 2023, six years ago would be 2017. The year parameter in the function has an enum that includes '2017', so I can set the year to '2017' for that part. But the user says \"around six years ago,\" which might include 2016 or 2018, but the enum only has 2017. Wait, the enum for year includes 2016 and 2017, etc. Wait, looking back, the year enum includes '2016', '2017', etc. So six years before 2023 is 2017. So setting year to '2017' would cover that. However, the user might mean approximately, so maybe 2016-2018? But the function's year parameter only allows specific years. Since the user specified \"around six years ago,\" and 2023-6=2017, I'll use 2017.\n\nSo, I need to make two separate calls to Music_3_LookupMusic. The first one with album='The New Classic' and the second with year='2017'. The other parameters can be left as default. Let me check the required parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic: the required list is empty, so all parameters are optional. So the first call would be Music_3_LookupMusic(album='The New Classic'), and the second call would be Music_3_LookupMusic(year='2017'). That should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The user provided all these: Austin, TX, 4 adults, check-in on 05/12/2023, check-out on 05/18/2023. So I can use that function directly. Wait, but maybe they need to search first? The Hotels_2_SearchHouse is for searching, but the user already knows they want to book. However, the booking function might require the house to be available. But the user didn't mention searching first, so maybe they already have a specific house in mind. But the problem is, the BookHouse function parameters don't include a house ID or name, just the location and dates. So perhaps the function is designed to book based on those parameters, assuming the house is available. But in reality, you usually search first, then book. However, the user's message is to book, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the booking function. But wait, the parameters for BookHouse don't include any filters like laundry or rating, so maybe the user hasn't searched yet. However, the user hasn't mentioned any specific house, so maybe the function is designed to book the first available house matching the criteria. But the function's description says \"Book the selected house\", which implies that the house is already selected. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to first search for available houses using Hotels_2_SearchHouse, then book one. But the user's request is to book, not search. However, without searching, the booking function might not have enough info. But according to the parameters, the BookHouse function only needs location, adults, check-in, and check-out dates. It doesn't require a specific house. Maybe the function is designed to automatically find and book a house based on those parameters. But that's not typical. Usually, you search first, then book. However, the user hasn't provided any details about the house's features, so maybe they just want to proceed with booking using the basic info. \n\nIn this case, since the user is asking to book, and the BookHouse function has all the required parameters, I should generate the function call for Hotels_2_BookHouse with the given details. The parameters are all present: where_to is Austin, TX, number_of_adults is 4, check_in_date 05/12/2023, check_out_date 05/18/2023.

Wait, the user might expect me to use \"this Friday\" as the date, but the function requires a specific date. However, the function's parameters don't have a way to input relative dates like \"this Friday.\" So maybe the user expects me to use the current date's Friday. But since I don't have access to the current date, perhaps the user is expected to provide the exact date. Wait, the user didn't specify the date, only \"this Friday.\" But the function requires the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. So maybe the assistant should ask for clarification on the exact date?

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the journey to be on May 15, and the start time is a specific time on that day. But the mention of \"one day before\" might be a mistake. Since the date_of_journey is required, I'll proceed with May 15, 2023 as the date_of_journey. The journey_start_time would need to be specified, but the user hasn't provided a specific time. However, the function requires journey_start_time. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should assume a default or ask, but since I have to generate the call, perhaps the user intended the start time as a specific time, but it's missing. Wait, the user might have made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date being May 14, but the user wrote May 15. This is confusing. However, given the information, I'll proceed with date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and assume that the journey_start_time is a time on that day, but since it's not provided, perhaps the user intended to include it. Wait, the user might have meant the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before the date? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user made a typo and meant the journey is on May 15, starting at a certain time. Since the required parameters include journey_start_time, but the user hasn't provided it, this is a problem. However, the user might have intended to provide it but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the \"one day before\" refers to the date being May 14. But the user wrote \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\"\u2014this is unclear. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended the journey to be on May 15, and the start time is, say, 8:00 AM, but since it's not specified, I can't proceed. However, the function requires journey_start_time, so this is a missing parameter. Therefore, the function call can't be made without that. But the user might have intended to provide the start time as part of the date. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 14, but the date is May 15. This is conflicting. Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should proceed with the date as May 15, and note that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to include it. Alternatively, maybe the \"starting at one day before\" is a mistake, and the user meant the journey is on May 15, starting at a certain time. Since the user hasn't provided the time, the function call can't be completed. Therefore, the required parameters are missing. But the user might have intended to provide the time, but it's not in the query. Therefore, the answer would be that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might have made a mistake in the query. Alternatively, maybe the \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date being May 14. Let me re-express the user's request: \"book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". So the journey is on May 15, but starting at one day before (May 14)? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is one day before the date? That's not possible. Alternatively, the user might have meant the journey is on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But since the user didn't specify, the function call can't be made. Therefore, the required parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the start time but forgot. In that case, the assistant should point out the missing parameters. But according to the instructions, if required parameters are missing, indicate that. So in this case, the journey_start_time is required but not provided. Therefore, the function call can't be made. However, the user might have intended to provide the start time as part of the date. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the date. Given the ambiguity, the correct approach is to note that the required parameters are missing. Therefore, the answer would be that the journey_start_time is missing. But the user might have intended to provide it. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the date is May 14, but wrote May 15. This is unclear. Given the information, the function call can't be made without the journey_start_time. Therefore, the response should indicate that the required parameters are missing."}

Let me check the parameters. The province_id for Bangkok is 1. The district_name should be \"Chatuchak\". The start_available_date needs to be set to \"2024-03-22 00:00:00\" to cover that date. For reputation, the avg_rating parameter is relevant. Since they want a good reputation, maybe set avg_rating to 4.0 or higher. But the default is None, so maybe the user doesn't specify a rating, but the function allows filtering by that. Wait, the user said \"good reputation,\" which likely translates to a high average rating. However, the function's parameters have avg_rating as a float. The user didn't specify a number, but I should infer that they want a high rating. However, since the function allows passing avg_rating, maybe I should set it to a value like 4.0. But the user might not have given an exact number. Alternatively, maybe the system handles \"good reputation\" as a default filter. Wait, the function doesn't have a parameter for reputation directly, only avg_rating. So I need to use avg_rating to represent that. Since the user didn't specify a number, perhaps I should leave it as default (None) and let the system handle it, but the user wants options with a good reputation, so maybe setting a minimum rating. However, the function's parameters don't have a min_rating, only avg_rating. So maybe the user expects that the avg_rating is considered. But since the user didn't specify a number, perhaps the assistant should set a reasonable value, like 4.0. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle it without specifying, but the user wants good reputation, so including avg_rating=4.0 makes sense. Also, the service_id for cleaning is 1, 2, 3, etc. Wait, the service_id enum includes 1 for cleaning service. So I should set service_id=1. Also, check if the function requires any other parameters.

Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe first function (CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens) requires user_id and include_revoked. The user provided user_id 12345. If I set include_revoked to True, it might get revoked tokens. But the second function (api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens) can include expired tokens if include_expired is True. The user might need both, but the functions are separate. However, the user might not know the difference between shareable and regular tokens. \n\nBut the user's message is urgent: \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!!\". So maybe they want all tokens from both functions. However, the functions are different. Let me check if the first function is part of the same API. The first function is under CustomDashboardsApi, and the second under api_token_api. They might be separate endpoints. \n\nBut the user might not be aware of that. Since the user provided their user ID, I should use the first function with include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens, and then use the second function with include_expired=True to get all regular tokens. However, the second function doesn't require a user_id parameter. Wait, looking at the parameters for api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, the required list is empty. So maybe it's authenticated via the session, and the user_id is not needed. But the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary for the first function. \n\nSo, the first function requires user_id, which the user provided. The second function might not need it. But the user might be under the impression that both functions are needed. However, the user might not know the difference between the two functions. Since the user is insistent, I should call both functions to cover all possibilities. \n\nFirst, call CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. Then, call api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, page=1, and page_size=100 to get as many as possible. But the second function's page_size max is 100. However, the user might have more than 100 tokens, but since they said \"now\", maybe just the first page is sufficient. But the user might need all, so perhaps set page_size to 100 and include_expired=True. \n\nBut the user might not have expired tokens, but to be thorough, include_expired=True. So the two function calls would be:\n\nCustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens(user_id='12345', include_revoked=True)\napi_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens(include_expired=True, page=1, page_size=100)\n\nBut the user might not need the second function if they are only interested in shareable tokens. However, the user said \"ALL API TOKENS\", so both functions are needed. Therefore, the answer should include both function calls."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' which requires parameters like experience_or_education_type and experience_or_education_name. The enum for experience_or_education_type includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', which matches the user's query. \n\nSo, I should call that function. The parameters would be experience_or_education_type set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and experience_or_education_name might be optional, but since the user specified the education name, maybe it's needed. Wait, the default for experience_or_education_name is 'Not specified', but the user is asking for details at UNS, so maybe the name is already part of the type. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'experience_or_education_name' is the specific program or degree, but the user didn't mention that. Since the user just mentioned the university, perhaps the type alone is sufficient. \n\nI think the correct call is to use 'detail_experience_and_education' with experience_or_education_type as 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)' and leave experience_or_education_name as default. But wait, the parameters require 'experience_or_education_type' and 'experience_or_education_name' is optional. Since the user is asking for education at UNS, the type already includes that. So the function call would be detail_experience_and_education(experience_or_education_type='Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'). \n\nI don't think the name is needed here because the type is specific enough. Let me check the parameters again. The 'experience_or_education_name' has a default of 'Not specified', so if it's not provided, it's okay. So the correct function call is to use detail_experience_and_education with the type parameter set to the education at UNS."}
{"id": "live_multiple_1051-278-0", "result": "[set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00', purpose='meeting')]", "input_token_count": 704, "output_token_count": 559, "latency": 14.364894151687622, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to set a reminder for 7:00 AM tomorrow, December 1st, 2023, to wake up early for a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for an alarm at a specific time, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for durations, which doesn't fit here.\n\nThe parameters for set_alarm require alarm_time. The user specified \"7:00 AM\" and the date is tomorrow, which is 2023-12-01. So the alarm_time should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or a similar standard format. The user mentioned \"7:00 AM\", so combining the date and time, it would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. Alternatively, since the date is tomorrow, maybe the function can handle relative dates, but the example given in the function's parameters includes a specific date. To be precise, including the date is better.\n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, with a default of 'reminder'. The user mentioned it's for a meeting, so setting purpose to 'meeting' makes sense. But the default is 'reminder', so maybe the user just wants the default. However, specifying the purpose as 'meeting' would be more accurate. Wait, the user said \"Can you set a reminder for 7:00 AM?\" So the purpose is a reminder, but the reason is for a meeting. However, the function's purpose parameter is for the purpose of the alarm. The example given in the function's parameters for set_alarm includes 'wake up' or 'meeting' as possible purposes. So the user's meeting is the purpose. Therefore, the purpose should be 'meeting'.\n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose='meeting'.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Maybe that's a typo for \"tomorrow\". So the date is December 1st, which is tomorrow. So the alarm_time is correct as '2023-12-01 07:00:00'.\n\nI think that's all. The parameters are correctly specified. The function call should be set_alarm with those parameters."}
