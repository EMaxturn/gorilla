The user wants to modify two things: their food order and their drink order. \n\nFirst, for the food part: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be \"without anchovies\", but the function's specialInstructions parameter is a string, so maybe that's where it goes. Wait, but the function's parameters have newIngredients and removeIngredients as separate. So maybe the specialInstructions is for other notes. But the user specifically said \"without anchovies\", which is a removal. So perhaps removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". The function's parameters require foodItem, which is provided.\n\nNext, the drink order: the user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should include size: \"large\", temperature: \"hot\", sweetness_level: \"regular\", milk_type: \"almond\". The special_instructions parameter is part of new_preferences as well, but the user didn't mention any, so it can be left as default.\n\nSo, two function calls are needed. First, ChaFod with foodItem \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients \"anchovies\". Then, ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id \"123\" and new_preferences including the specified parameters."}

The user is asking for the latest news reports for two different locations: Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland. They want the news in English and specifically focusing on technology for both.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's get_news_report which requires a location, category, and language. The parameters for location are 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, France, that's straightforward as it's a city and country. Letterkenny, Ireland would be 'Letterkenny, Ireland' since Ireland is a country. \n\nThe category needs to be one of the specified enums. The user mentioned technology, so I should set category to 'Technology'. The language is English, which is the default 'en', so that's covered.\n\nI need to make two separate function calls. The first for Paris, France with category Technology and language en. The second for Letterkenny, Ireland with the same parameters. \n\nWait, the function's location parameter says if state isn't available, use 'City, Country'. So for Paris, it's 'Paris, France' and Letterkenny is 'Letterkenny, Ireland'. Both are valid. \n\nSo the parameters for each function call would be:\n\nFor Paris:\nlocation: \"Paris, France\"\ncategory: \"Technology\"\nlanguage: \"en\"\n\nFor Letterkenny:\nlocation: \"Letterkenny, Ireland\"\ncategory: \"Technology\"\nlanguage: \"en\"\n\nI should structure the JSON with both function calls. Make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. No missing parameters here. The user didn't specify any other parameters, so defaults are okay. The category is explicitly set to Technology, which is in the enum. Language is 'en' as required. \n\nLooks good. So the response should include both function calls with these parameters."}

Wait, maybe the user wants interviewers qualified in either Python or Java. But the function can only handle one skill at a time. So I need to make two separate calls.

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I'll need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url and destination. The user didn't specify a destination, so the default is the current directory. I'll set repo_url to the given URL and destination to '.'.\n\nNext, step 2 involves analyzing the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function is needed here. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the repo directory. Since we cloned it into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory_name. Once analyzed, we need to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. \n\nFor the Dockerfile, the create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Again, using '.' since the repo is in the current directory. Then, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name, which is the same. The user didn't specify deployment_name or image_name, so I'll use the defaults. Replicas and port have defaults too, so those should be okay. Service type is defaulting to ClusterIP, which is fine unless specified otherwise.\n\nAfter creating these files, step 3 says to add all changed files to Git. But the functions provided don't include a 'add changes' function. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function does a git add, but the user says \"add all changed files to git changes\". However, the available functions might not have an 'add' command. But looking at the functions, push_git_changes_to_github has a parameter directory_name and commits changes. Maybe the user expects that after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, those changes are added. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which might be a typo for \"add all changes to git\". However, the available functions don't have a separate 'add' function. The push function does git add, but it's part of the push process. So maybe the user expects that after creating the files, we call push_git_changes_to_github. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is to commit and push. So perhaps the push function handles both adding and committing. But the user's step 3 is separate. However, the functions available don't have an 'add' function. So maybe the user is expecting that after creating the files, the push function will handle adding and committing. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, which might not be directly possible with the given functions. But since the functions don't have an 'add' command, maybe the push function is the only one that can add changes. So perhaps the user's step 3 is part of the push process. But the user's step 4 is to commit and push. So maybe the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github after creating the files. However, the user's step 3 is to add changes, which might not be possible with the given functions. But the available functions don't have an 'add' function, so maybe the user is mistaken, but we have to proceed with the available functions. So the steps would be: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile and YAMLs, then push. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, which might be part of the push function. So the push function would handle adding and committing. Therefore, the correct function calls would be clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and then push_git_changes_to_github. The parameters for push would be directory_name as the repo directory, commit message as 'Update changes' (default), branch 'main', and force_push as False. So that's the plan."}

They're getting a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', etc. But the error is related to 'CellResult', so I need to figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. \n\nFor the first part, the function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate. The parameters needed are 'search_string', which here would be 'CellResult', and they want to include subdirectories, so 'include_subdirectories' should be True. The default for that is False, so I need to set it explicitly.\n\nThen, for the method signatures, the 'get_signature' function can be used. They need the signature of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. So I'll need to call 'get_signature' twice, once for each method. The parameters for each call would be 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as the respective method names. Also, the 'include_private' parameter is optional and defaults to False, which is fine here unless the methods are private, but the user mentioned overriding them, so they're likely public.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class is part of the repository, and the user needs to check if it's present. But the first part of the query is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult', so using 'get_relevant_classes' with 'CellResult' as the search string and including subdirectories should help locate that class. \n\nSo the plan is to first call 'get_relevant_classes' with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories True. Then, call 'get_signature' for 'AbstractCellHandler's 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods. That should address both parts of the user's request."}

The function available is get_area_of_square, which requires the size parameter. The user provided 5 cm, so I'll use that. The unit is cm, but the function's parameter is just a float, so 5.0 should be fine. No need to convert units here since the function just needs the numerical value.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. That might be a mistake. However, the function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. The user said Queenstown Singapore, which is a bit confusing. But maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore by mistake. However, the function can take 'Country' as part of the location. So I'll use \"Queenstown, Singapore\" as the location. But wait, Singapore is a country, so maybe the correct format is \"Queenstown, Singapore\" but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user intended Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore. However, the function's parameters accept 'Country' in the location. So I'll proceed with the given location as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The unit isn't specified, so the default is fahrenheit. \n\nSo, two function calls: one for the area with size 5, and another for the weather with location Queenstown, Singapore. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The area function's parameter is 'size', which is 5.0. The weather function's location is \"Queenstown, Singapore\". \n\nWait, but the user might have a typo. Queenstown is in New Zealand, not Singapore.
