I remember there's a function called calculate_final_velocity that does this. Let me check the parameters. The function requires height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height here is 150 meters. The initial velocity is given as zero, so I should set that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different value. Since the question doesn't mention any other gravity, I can use the default. So the function call should include height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Wait, the initial_velocity is optional with a default of zero, but the user explicitly said initial velocity is zero, so including it makes sense. But maybe the function's default is already zero.

The user wants to update their customer information. The user ID is 43523, and the details to update are name 'John Doe' and email 'johndoe@email.com'. The function provided is update_user_info. \n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters required for this function. The function needs user_id, update_info, and optionally the database name. The user specified the user ID and the info, so I can map those directly. The database has a default, so maybe it's not necessary to include unless specified. The user mentioned \"in the database,\" but since the default is CustomerInfo, maybe that's already correct. \n\nWait, the update_info should be a dictionary. The user provided name and email, so I can structure that as a dict. The function's parameters are user_id (int), update_info (dict), and database (str, default). So putting it all together, the function call should have user_id=43523, update_info={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@email.com'}, and database might be optional. Since the user didn't specify a different database, I can omit it or include the default. But the function's default is 'CustomerInfo', so including it explicitly might be better to avoid confusion. Wait, the default is already set, so maybe it's not needed. But the user's instruction says \"in the database,\" which might imply using the default. So I should include the database parameter with the default value. Wait, no, the default is already 'CustomerInfo', so if the user doesn't specify, it's okay. But the user's message says \"in the database,\" which might just be indicating where the info is stored, so the default is correct. \n\nSo the function call would be update_user_info with user_id=43523, update_info as the dict, and database as 'CustomerInfo' (though the default is already that). But since the user didn't specify a different database, it's safe to use the default. Therefore, the parameters are user_id=43523 and update_info={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@email.com'}. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted.

So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the functions provided, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters. The function requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides which defaults to 6. \n\nIn this case, the desired_number is 6, number_of_rolls is 2, and die_sides is 6.

The user wants to book a single room at a pet friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required args are location, room_type, duration, start_date, and optional preferences.\n\nThe location is specified as near Manhattan, New York. So I'll put location as \"Manhattan, New York\". Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The user mentioned pet friendly, which is a preference. So preferences should include 'pet friendly'.\n\nWait, the preferences parameter is a list. So I need to make sure to format that correctly. The function allows preferences as an optional list. Since the user specified pet friendly, I'll add that to the preferences list.\n\nPutting it all together: call hotel_booking with location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"2023-03-10\", preferences=[\"pet friendly\"]. \n\nWait, the start_date format. The example might expect YYYY-MM-DD. The user wrote March 10th, 2023, so converting that to 2023-03-10. That's correct.\n\nI think that's all. All required parameters are provided. The preferences are included as a list. So the function call should work."}
