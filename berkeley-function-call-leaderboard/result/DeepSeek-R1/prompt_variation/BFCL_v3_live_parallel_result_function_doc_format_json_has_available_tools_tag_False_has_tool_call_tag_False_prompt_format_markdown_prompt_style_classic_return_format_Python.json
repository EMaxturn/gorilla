The function does not specify which parameter returns the temperature, but the description says it retrieves current weather information.\n However, the user specifically asks for temperature. We assume the function returns the current temperature in the specified unit.\n\n Since the question does not specify a unit, we can use the default (celsius).

The function requires:\n   - food_name (string)\n   - portion_amount (float)\n   - portion_unit (string, from enum: ['cup', 'grams', 'slice', 'piece', 'tablespoon'])\n   - meal_type (string, optional, default 'snack')\n   - log_date (string, optional, default None)\n\n However, note that the user did not specify the time for the two meals. We can assume:\n   - The first part (frozen mango and chai tea) is the current meal (or the most recent one).\n   - The second part (pizza and coffee) is an earlier meal.\n\n Since the user did not specify the meal type, we can use the default 'snack' for all? But note that the user might have had:\n   - The pizza and coffee for breakfast or lunch? \n   - The mango and chai tea for a snack or dinner?\n\n But the problem says: if the given question lacks the parameters, point it out. However, the function has defaults for meal_type and log_date.\n\n We are missing:\n   - The exact time for log_date? We don't have it. We can leave as None (which is the default) or if the function allows default we don't need to specify.\n\n Approach:\n We will log each food item separately.\n\n For the first part (current?): \n   - frozen mango: 8 pieces -> so food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece'\n   - chai tea: but note, the user didn't specify the amount? Only \"a chai tea\". \n\n How to handle \"a chai tea\"? \n   - We don't know the portion. The function requires portion_amount and portion_unit. \n   - Since it's not specified, we cannot log without making an assumption? But the problem says: if lacking parameters, point it out.\n\n However, note the problem: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n We have two options:\n   Option 1: Skip logging the chai tea because we don't know the portion.\n   Option 2: Make a reasonable assumption? But the problem says to point it out if lacking.\n\n But the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and if we cannot call because of missing parameters, we must point it out.\n\n However, the format for the response is strictly function calls. How do we point it out? The instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" and \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n But note the multi-turn behavior: we are to output function calls until we have fulfilled the user's request. And if we cannot call a function because of missing parameters, we must point it out. However, the format for the response is only function calls. This is a conflict.\n\n Clarification: The system expects only function calls in the response. Therefore, we cannot output free text to point out missing parameters? \n\n So what to do?\n   We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one turn. We can log the ones we have complete information for, and skip the ones we don't? But the problem says we must point out the lack of parameters.\n\n Since the system expects only function calls, and if we cannot log a food because of missing parameters, we cannot call the function for that food. Therefore, we should only log the foods that have the required parameters.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n 1. Frozen mango: \n      food_name: 'frozen mango'\n      portion_amount: 8.0\n      portion_unit: 'piece' -> which is in the enum.\n\n 2. Chai tea: \n      We have \"a chai tea\", which implies 1 unit, but what unit? \n      We don't know. The enum doesn't have 'cup'? Actually, it does. But is a chai tea typically a cup? \n      However, the user didn't specify. We cannot assume because the function requires the unit and we must use one of the enum. \n      Therefore, we cannot log chai tea because we don't know the portion_unit? Or we can assume 'cup'? But the problem says if lacking, point it out.\n\n Since we are not allowed to output text, we have to skip chai tea? But then we are not fulfilling the user's request to log all.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" but the format is function calls. So we are in a dilemma.\n\n How about we log the chai tea with an arbitrary unit? That would be incorrect.\n\n After re-examining the function: the portion_unit must be one of the enum. We don't have 'serving' or 'bottle'. We have 'cup'. Maybe we can use 'cup' for the chai tea? But the user didn't say a cup.\n\n Since the instruction says to point it out when lacking, and we cannot output text, we must skip the chai tea? \n\n Similarly, for the pizza and coffee:\n\n 3. Two slices of pepperoni pizza:\n      food_name: 'pepperoni pizza'\n      portion_amount: 2.0\n      portion_unit: 'slice' -> which is in the enum.\n\n 4. A coffee: \n      Again, we don't know the portion. We could assume a cup? But the enum has 'cup'. However, the user didn't specify.\n\n But note: the function has a default for meal_type and log_date. So for the pizza and coffee, we can log the pizza but skip the coffee? \n\n However, the user might have intended the coffee to be in the same meal as the pizza? We can set the meal_type for both to the same? But we don't know the meal_type for the earlier meal.\n\n We are not given the meal_type for any of the foods. We can use the default 'snack' for all? But that might not be accurate.\n\n The function allows the meal_type to be optional and defaults to 'snack'. So we can omit it and it will be set to 'snack'. Similarly, log_date can be omitted.\n\n Therefore, we can log:\n   - frozen mango (with meal_type defaulting to 'snack')\n   - pepperoni pizza (with meal_type defaulting to 'snack')\n\n But what about the two meals? They are at different times. The function has a parameter `log_date` which we don't have. We can leave it as default (None) for both? \n\n The problem says: if the question lacks parameters, point it out. We lack the log_date and meal_type? But the function has defaults for both. So we don't need to provide them? \n\n Therefore, we can log the foods that have the required parameters (food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit) and skip the ones that don't.\n\n Plan:\n   Log:\n     1. frozen mango: 8 pieces -> log_food(food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece')\n     2. pepperoni pizza: 2 slices -> log_food(food_name='pepperoni pizza', portion_amount=2.0, portion_unit='slice')\n\n   Skip chai tea and coffee because we don't know the portion_unit? But wait, for coffee we could use 'cup'? And for chai tea we could also use 'cup'? \n\n   However, the user said \"a chai tea\" and \"a coffee\", which in common terms might mean one cup. But the function requires the unit to be one of the enum. We have 'cup'. So we can assume:\n\n     3. chai tea: portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup'\n     4. coffee: portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup'\n\n   But is this accurate? It might be, but the problem says if the parameters are lacking we should point it out. However, the user did say \"a\", which we can interpret as one unit. And the unit for a drink is often a cup. So it's a reasonable assumption? \n\n   But note: the function description says the portion_unit must be one of the enum. We are using 'cup' which is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, we can log all four:\n\n     - frozen mango: 8 pieces\n     - chai tea: 1 cup\n     - pepperoni pizza: 2 slices\n     - coffee: 1 cup\n\n   However, note that the two sets of foods are from two different meals. The function has a parameter `meal_type` and `log_date` to distinguish them. We don't have the meal_type or the exact time. We can leave them as default? \n\n   But the function allows us to set the meal_type. We don't know, so we leave it as default (snack) for all? That would group them all as snacks. But the user might have had pizza for lunch and mango for a snack? \n\n   The user said \"earlier\" for the pizza and coffee, so they are two distinct meals. We can set the meal_type for the pizza and coffee to one meal (maybe lunch?) and the mango and chai tea to another (maybe snack?).\n\n   However, we don't have that information. We have two options:\n\n     Option A: Log all as snacks (default) and without a date. This is acceptable because the function defaults are set.\n\n     Option B: Try to infer? The problem says if lacking, point it out. But we cannot output text. So we must use the defaults.\n\n   Therefore, we will log all four items with the required parameters and omit the optional ones.\n\n   But note: the function expects the `log_date` to be in ISO format. We don't have it, so we leave it as None (by not including it, since the default is None).\n\n   Also, we can set the meal_type if we want? But the user didn't specify. So we leave it as default.\n\n   However, the function has an optional `meal_type` with a default. We can omit it.\n\n   But wait: the two meals are at different times. Without a log_date, they will both be logged as the same time? Actually, no: the function doesn't have a way to group by meal unless we set the log_date. We don't have the time, so we cannot set the log_date. Therefore, they will be logged without a timestamp and without meal type, so they are just four separate items.\n\n   This might be acceptable? \n\n   Alternatively, we can set the meal_type for the earlier meal and the current meal differently? But we don't know what meal they were. The user only said \"earlier\". \n\n   We don't have enough information to set meal_type, so we use the default.\n\n   Therefore, we will log:\n\n     log_food(food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece')\n     log_food(food_name='chai tea', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup')\n     log_food(food_name='pepperoni pizza', portion_amount=2.0, portion_unit='slice')\n     log_food(food_name='coffee', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup')\n\n   But note: the user said \"a chai tea\" and \"a coffee\". We are logging them as 1 cup. This is an assumption, but it's the best we can do.\n\n   Alternatively, we could log the chai tea and coffee without unit? That is not allowed because the function requires portion_unit.\n\n   So we must either skip or use an assumed unit. Since the enum has 'cup', and it is common for drinks, we choose 'cup'.\n\n   However, the function also has 'tablespoon'. That is too small for a typical drink. So cup is reasonable.\n\n   Therefore, we make four function calls.\n\n   But note: the function call format is a list of function calls.\n\n   We must output in the exact format: [func1(params), func2(params), ...]\n\n   So:\n\n   [\n      log_food(food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece'),\n      log_food(food_name='chai tea', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup'),\n      log_food(food_name='pepperoni pizza', portion_amount=2.0, portion_unit='slice'),\n      log_food(food_name='coffee', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup')\n   ]\n\n   But note: the function name is `log_food`, and the parameters are passed by keyword.\n\n   Also, note: the coffee might be spelled as 'coffee', not 'coffee'. The user said \"coffee\".\n\n   Correction: food_name for coffee should be 'coffee'.\n\n   Also, for the chai tea: we can use 'chai tea' as the name.\n\n   However, what if the database has a specific name for chai tea? But we don't have a database, we are just logging. So we use the user's term.\n\n   Therefore, the function calls:\n\n   [\n      log_food(food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece'),\n      log_food(food_name='chai tea', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup'),\n      log_food(food_name='pepperoni pizza', portion_amount=2.0, portion_unit='slice'),\n      log_food(food_name='coffee', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup')\n   ]\n\n   We are not including the optional parameters (meal_type and log_date) because we don't have the information and the function has defaults.\n\n   But note: the function signature in the provided tool has `log_date` default as None and `meal_type` default as 'snack'. So we are safe.\n\n   However, we must note that the two sets of foods are from two different times. Without a log_date, they might be considered as the same time? But the user said \"earlier\". \n\n   We don't have the exact time, so we cannot set log_date. We must leave it to the system to assign the current time? But the function doesn't say. The function expects a string in ISO format. If we don't provide, it uses None. The application might then assign the current time at the moment of logging? That would be incorrect for the earlier meal.\n\n   How to handle? We cannot set the time because we don't have it. Therefore, we log without the time and hope the application can handle it? \n\n   Alternatively, we can skip the earlier meal? But the user wants to log all.\n\n   We have no way to set the time for the earlier meal. Therefore, we log all without the time. The application might allow the user to edit later? \n\n   Since the problem doesn't provide the time, we do the best we can.\n\n   We log all four items.\n\n   But note: the function's `log_date` parameter description says: \"The date and time when the food was consumed, in ISO 8601 format such as 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'.\", and the default is None. So we are allowed to leave it as None.\n\n   Therefore, we proceed.\n\n   One more thing: the function expects the portion_amount to be a float. We are using 8.0, 1.0, etc. So that's fine.\n\n   So the final answer is:\n\n   [log_food(food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece'), log_food(food_name='chai tea', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup'), log_food(food_name='pepperoni pizza', portion_amount=2.0, portion_unit='slice'), log_food(food_name='coffee', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup')]\n\n   However, note that the function call format in the response must be exactly as described: without any extra text.\n\n   But the user mentioned two separate meals. We are logging them as four separate items without grouping. The application might present them as four separate logs. That's acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we could set the meal_type for the earlier meal to something else? But we don't know. We leave it as default.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the user might have intended the two slices of pizza and the coffee as one meal (say lunch) and the mango and chai tea as another (say snack). We don't know the meal types, so we cannot set them. We leave as default.\n\n   Therefore, we output the four function calls.\n\n   But note: the function call for the pizza and coffee are from an earlier meal. We could set a different meal_type for the two sets? We don't know what they are, so we don't.\n\n   We are only required to use the information given.\n\n   We have no information about the meal types, so we use the default for all.\n\n   We output:\n\n   [\n        log_food(food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8.0, portion_unit='piece'),\n        log_food(food_name='chai tea', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup'),\n        log_food(food_name='pepperoni pizza', portion_amount=2.0, portion_unit='slice'),\n        log_food(food_name='coffee', portion_amount=1.0, portion_unit='cup')\n   ]\n\n   However, note: the function call for the chai tea and coffee: we are using 'cup'. Is that acceptable? The enum includes 'cup'. So yes.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   But wait: what if the user meant a bottle of chai tea? Or a glass? We don't know. But we are forced to choose from the enum. We choose the closest.\n\n   If the user comes back and says it was a bottle, we can adjust? But we are logging now.\n\n   We do the best we can.\n\n   Therefore, we output the function calls as above.\n\n   Note: the function call for the pizza: we have the unit as 'slice'. That is in the enum.\n\n   All set.\n\n   Let's write the response."}

We have \"Boston, MA\" and we'll use \"San Francisco, CA\".\n\n Since the unit is optional and we are using the default, we can omit it.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n [get_current_weather(location=\"Boston, MA\"), get_current_weather(location=\"San Francisco, CA\")]"}
