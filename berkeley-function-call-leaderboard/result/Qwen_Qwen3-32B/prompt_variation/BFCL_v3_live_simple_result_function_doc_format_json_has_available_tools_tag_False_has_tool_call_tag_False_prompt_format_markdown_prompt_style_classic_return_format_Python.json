However, the function's parameters might automatically convert it, or maybe the user made a typo. Since the function's enum includes 'ethernet', I should use the correct case as per the enum. So in the params, interfaceType should be 'ethernet' instead of 'Ethernet'. But the user specified 'Ethernet', so maybe that's a mistake. But since the function's enum is case-sensitive, I need to use the exact value. Therefore, the correct value is 'ethernet' in lowercase.

Let me check the available functions. There's the Weather_1_GetWeather function. It requires the city and an optional date parameter. The city is provided as Rutherford, NJ. The date needs to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user specified April 22nd, 2023, so that would be '2023-04-22'. The default date is '2019-03-01', but we need to override that. So I should call the function with city='Rutherford, NJ' and date='2023-04-22'. Let me make sure there are no typos. Yep, that's correct. The function should retrieve the forecast for that specific date."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function. It takes directed_by, genre, and cast. The user specified the director, so I'll set directed_by to \"James Gray\". They didn't mention genre or cast, so I'll use the default \"dontcare\" for those. That should retrieve movies directed by him regardless of genre or cast. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. Yep, looks good. Let me call that function."}

The user didn't mention shuffle or volume, so I'll use the defaults. The query should be 'track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar'. So the function call would be play_spotify_song with that query. No need to specify shuffle or volume since they're optional. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted."}

The user wants to book a flight from JFK on March 16, 2024, around 14:00. The available function is book_flight, which requires departure_location, departure_date, and departure_time.\n\nFirst, check the parameters. Departure location is JFK, which is valid as an airport code. The date is 16th March 2024. The function specifies the date format as dd/mm/yyyy, so that should be 16/03/2024. The departure time is 14:00, which in 24-hour format is correct. \n\nWait, the user said \"around 14:00\". The function requires an exact time. But since the user is asking for something around that time, maybe we can use 14:00 as the exact time. The function doesn't mention flexibility, so I'll proceed with the given time. \n\nAll required parameters are provided. The date is after 14/03/2024 as required. So the function call should be book_flight with those parameters."}
