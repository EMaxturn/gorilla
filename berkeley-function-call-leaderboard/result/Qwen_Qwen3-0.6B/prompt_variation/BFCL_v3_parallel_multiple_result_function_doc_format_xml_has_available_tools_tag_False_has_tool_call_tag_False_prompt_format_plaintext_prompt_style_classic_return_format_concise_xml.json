The available functions are get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nLooking at get_sculpture_details, it requires a museum location and a sculpture ID. The user provided both locations but didn't mention specific IDs. The get_artwork_price function requires a museum location, sculpture material, and size (as an array). \n\nSince the user mentioned two different sculptures, maybe I need to call both functions for each sculpture. But wait, the user is asking for the average price. However, the functions provided don't include a way to calculate an average. The get_artwork_price function gives the price based on size and material, but without knowing the IDs, I can't retrieve the exact prices. \n\nSo, I need to call get_sculpture_details for each sculpture. For the first sculpture, the location is the Museum of Philadelphia, and the material is marble. The size is 4x4 ft. For the second, the location is New York, material bronze, size 6x3 ft. \n\nBut wait, the user didn't provide the sculpture IDs. The get_sculpture_details function requires both parameters.

The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nSince the user is asking for the average price, but the functions don't allow for averaging, I can't compute it. Therefore, I need to call both functions for each sculpture, but since the user's question lacks the required parameters, maybe I can't proceed. \n\nWait, but the user's question includes the locations and the sizes, but not the IDs. So, perhaps the functions can be called with the given information. Let me try. For each sculpture, call get_sculpture_details with the location and material. Then, for the price, use get_artwork_price with the location, material, and size. \n\nBut the problem is that the user's question doesn't specify the IDs. So, maybe the functions can be called even without the IDs, but the parameters are required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the get_artwork_price function with the given sizes and materials, but since the IDs aren't provided, perhaps that's not possible. \n\nIn this case, the correct approach is to call both functions for each sculpture, even though the IDs are missing. But since the user's question doesn't provide the IDs, maybe the answer is that the functions can't be used without those parameters. \n\nBut the user's question does mention the locations and sizes, so perhaps I can proceed. Let me structure the function calls. \n\nFirst, call get_sculpture_details for the marble statue in Philadelphia. Then, call get_sculpture_details for the bronze statue in New York. Then, call get_artwork_price for each. \n\nBut the user's question is about the average price, which requires combining the two results. However, the functions don't allow for averaging. Therefore, the answer would be that the average can't be determined with the given functions. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. So, perhaps the correct steps are to call both functions, even if they don't provide the average. \n\nWait, but the user's question is asking for the average, which implies that the functions should return the individual prices and then compute the average. However, the functions provided don't have an average calculation. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be to call both functions, but since the user's question lacks the required parameters (IDs), maybe that's the case. \n\nSo, the final answer would be to call both get_sculpture_details functions with the provided locations and materials, and then perhaps the get_artwork_price function for each. But since the user's question doesn't specify the IDs, maybe those functions can't be used. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check again. The user's question says \"average price of a 4 ft x 4 ft marble statue in the museum of Philadelphia and 6 ft x 3 ft bronze sculpture in New York museum.\" \n\nSo, the two sculptures are specified. The get_sculpture_details function requires a museum location and a sculpture ID. The user provided both locations but not IDs. The get_artwork_price function requires a museum location, material, and size. \n\nSince the user didn't provide the IDs, maybe the functions can't be used. Therefore, the answer is that the functions can't be used without the required parameters. \n\nBut the user expects function calls. So, perhaps the correct approach is to call both functions, even if the IDs are missing. \n\nWait, but the parameters for get_sculpture_details require both parameters. The user provided the locations but not the IDs. So, maybe the function can't be called without the IDs. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the functions can't be used without the required parameters. \n\nBut the user's question includes the locations and sizes, so maybe the functions can be called. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use the get_artwork_price function with the given sizes and materials, even if the IDs are missing. \n\nBut the get_artwork_price function requires the sculpture_material and size. The user provided the material and size for each sculpture. \n\nSo, for the first sculpture, the material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. For the second, bronze, 6x3 ft. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_sculpture_details for the marble statue in Philadelphia with location and material. \n2. Call get_sculpture_details for the bronze statue in New York with location and material. \n3. Call get_artwork_price for each sculpture. \n\nBut since the user's question is about the average, which requires combining the two results, but the functions don't allow for that, the answer would be that the average can't be determined. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to make function calls if possible. So, perhaps the correct answer is to call both functions, even if they don't provide the average. \n\nTherefore, the final answer would be to call both get_sculpture_details functions with the provided parameters and then perhaps the get_artwork_price functions. \n\nBut since the user's question is about the average, maybe the functions should be called for each sculpture, and then the average is calculated. However, the functions don't have an average calculation. \n\nIn conclusion, the functions can be called, but the average can't be determined. So, the answer is to call both functions."}

The glucose conversion efficiency is 10%, and the energy per mole is 2800 kJ. So, I need to use the biological.calc_energy function. The parameters required are moles and substance. The substance here is glucose, which is C6H12O6. The energy per mole is given as 2800 kJ/mol, so I'll input that. The efficiency is 10%, which is a float, so I'll set it to 0.10.\n\nNext, the second part is to calculate the biomass. The conversion efficiency is 10%, so the biomass would be energy divided by efficiency. The biological.calc_biomass function takes energy and efficiency as parameters. I already have the energy from the first step, so I need to call that function again with the energy value and the efficiency.\n\nThird, the machine needs to move 2 meters. The work done is energy multiplied by distance. The physical.calc_work function requires energy and distance.

The user wants to plan their meals for the day. They have three different parts: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each part has specific ingredients and calorie limits.\n\nFirst, for breakfast, they need eggs, milk, and bread. The calories should be under 300. So I should use the recipe_search function. The parameters needed are ingredients, calories, and meal type. The meal type here is breakfast, so I'll set that.\n\nNext, lunch. They want a restaurant with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce. The dishes should not exceed 500 calories. The restaurant_search function is the right one here. The ingredients are chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, and the calories are 500. The meal type for lunch is specified.\n\nThen, dinner. They want to replace beef with tofu and keep calories under 600. The ingredient_replace function is suitable. Original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and calories should be 600. The meal type for dinner is specified as dinner.\n\nI need to make sure each function call includes the correct parameters. Let me check the required fields again. For recipe_search, ingredients and calories are required. For ingredient_replace, original, replacement, and calories. All parameters are provided, so each function call should be correct."}

First, they want to know the function of ATP in mitochondria with a specific function. Then, calculate the driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. After that, find the scientist for the theory of relativity, and finally, get the price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish.\n\nStarting with the first part: ATP function in mitochondria. The user mentioned a specific function, so I need to use the cell_biology.function_lookup function. The parameters required are molecule, organelle, and specific_function. ATP is the molecule, mitochondria is the organelle, and specific_function should be true. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the driving distance. The user wants miles, so the unit parameter should be set to miles. The origin is New York, destination is Los Angeles. The function get_shortest_driving_distance needs origin and destination, and unit. So I'll call that function with those values.\n\nThen, the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function requires the discovery. The user mentioned the theory of relativity, so I'll set discovery to \"theory of relativity\". That function should return the scientist's name.\n\nLastly, the Fender Stratocaster price in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function needs brand, model, and finish. The user specified Fender, Stratocaster, and sunburst. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called with the correct parameters. Let me check each step again to ensure there are no missing parameters or typos. All required parameters are present for each function. Once all these are done, the user's request should be fully addressed."}

The user has two main tasks here. First, modifying the painting's attributes, and then predicting the evolutionary rate of an African elephant and calculating the poker probability.\n\nStarting with the painting modification. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant. The user wants to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, and red dominant. So I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size is 30x40, medium is oil, and dominant color is red. So the first function call should be modify_painting with those parameters.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The prediction.evolution function requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, model is Darwin. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The problem states there are 52 cards, 4 royal flush outcomes, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. Total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. So calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters again. The modify_painting requires size, medium, dominant_color. The prediction function needs species, years, model. The calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, round_to. All parameters are provided, so each function call should be correct."}

I'll need to call that function with area, rooms, year, and location.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, so I'll set those parameters. The state isn't specified, so maybe leave it out or use the default.\n\nThen, the probability part: total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user mentioned rounding, so I'll set round_to to 3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. Let me check each function's required parameters. The predict_house_price requires area, rooms, year, location. The lawsuit_search needs entity, county. The calculate_probability needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. All parameters are provided, so I can call each function one after another."}

The function get_collectables_in_season seems right here. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game is Fortnite, platform is PlayStation, region is Asia. The function game_score.highest requires game, platform, and region. So I'll use those parameters.\n\nThird, the lawsuits details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user mentioned Apple Inc. and year 2018, so I'll fill those in.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So I'll input those values.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the parameters. Let me check each one again to ensure no missing parameters. All four requests are covered with the appropriate functions and parameters."}
