But the function's parameters require duration as an integer. So I need to check if the user provided the duration correctly. The user wrote \"next 10 years and 20 years\", which could be 10 and 20 years. But the function's duration is an integer. So perhaps the duration is 30 years? Or maybe the user made a mistake.

Or perhaps the user intended 10 and 20 as separate periods. But the function's duration is a single integer. Hmm. Wait, maybe the duration is 10 years and 20 years, so total 30 years. But the function's parameters take duration as an integer. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but since the function requires duration as an integer, I need to use 30 years.

So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed with the given information. Wait, the user wrote \"next 10 years and 20 years\". So maybe the duration is 10 years and 20 years. But the function's duration is an integer. So perhaps the correct duration is 30 years. But the user might have intended 10 and 20 as separate periods. Alternatively, maybe the duration is 10 years and 20 years, so 30 years. But the function's parameters take duration as an integer. So I need to use 30 years.
