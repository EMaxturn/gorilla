It's not about finding exhibitions; it's about individual artworks. So, not directly relevant.\n\nThe best match is **find_exhibition**.\n\nNow, mapping the user's query to the parameters:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\" (I should use the full form as in the example).\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (since it's a sculpture exhibition).\n\n- month: User said \"upcoming month\", and the function description says default will return upcoming events, so I can omit this or use a default.\n\n- user_ratings: User wants \"top rated\", so I should set this to 'high'.\n\nThe function requires only 'location' and 'art_form'. The others are optional.\n\nSo, I need to call **find_exhibition** with:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\"\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\"\n\n- user_ratings: \"high\" (to get top rated)\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will default to upcoming.\n\nThis should cover the query.\n\nMy response should only be the function call in the specified format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nOnce I make this call, if that's all, the system will handle it. I don't need to add extra text.\n\nFinal function call: find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\nThat seems complete."}
{"id": "multiple_191", "result": "[book_hotel(hotel_name='Hotel Paradise', location='Las Vegas', room_type='luxury room', start_date='05-12-2022', stay_duration=3, view='city view')]", "input_token_count": 849, "output_token_count": 44, "latency": 6.981747150421143, "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants to book a hotel room. Looking at the available functions, there's one called \"book_hotel\" that matches this.\n\nLet me check the description: \"Book a room in a specific hotel with particular preferences.\"\n\nThe parameters for \"book_hotel\" are:\n\n- hotel_name: string, required\n\n- location: string, required\n\n- room_type: string, required\n\n- start_date: string, in format MM-DD-YYYY, required\n\n- stay_duration: integer, required\n\n- view: string, optional, with a default of 'No preference'\n\nFrom the user's query:\n\n- Hotel name: Hotel Paradise\n\n- Location: Las Vegas\n\n- Room type: luxury room (I need to interpret this as the room_type)\n\n- Start date: May 12, 2022, which should be formatted as 05-12-2022 (MM-DD-YYYY)\n\n- Stay duration: 3 days\n\n- View: city view\n\nAll required parameters are provided in the query.\n\nSo, I can call the \"book_hotel\" function with these values.\n\nLet me map them:\n\n- hotel_name: \"Hotel Paradise\"\n\n- location: \"Las Vegas\"\n\n- room_type: \"luxury room\" (assuming that's how it's specified)\n\n- start_date: \"05-12-2022\" (need to format it correctly)\n\n- stay_duration: 3\n\n- view: \"city view\"\n\nThe function call format should be: [book_hotel(hotel_name='Hotel Paradise', location='Las Vegas', room_type='luxury room', start_date='05-12-2022', stay_duration=3, view='city view')]\n\nI need to ensure the response is only the function call, in the exact format specified.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nSo, my response should be just: [book_hotel(hotel_name='Hotel Paradise', location='Las Vegas', room_type='luxury room', start_date='05-12-2022', stay_duration=3, view='city view')]\n\nThat seems correct. I've covered all required parameters and included the optional one since it's specified.\n\nOne potential issue: Is \"luxury room\" the exact string they expect? The function description doesn't specify, so I'll use it as is.\n\nAlso, date format: The user said \"May 12, 2022\", which is 05-12-2022 in MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nI think that's all. No need for multiple functions here."}
