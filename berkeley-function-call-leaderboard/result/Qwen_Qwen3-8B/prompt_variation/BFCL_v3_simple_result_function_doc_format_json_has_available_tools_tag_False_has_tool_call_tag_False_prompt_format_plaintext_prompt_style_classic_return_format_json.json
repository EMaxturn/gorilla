The initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, so since the user specified it's zero, I can include that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so unless they mention a different gravity, I don't need to change that. So the parameters would be height: 150, initial_velocity: 0.

For age, the field is 'age', operation is '>', value is '25'. For job, field is 'job', operation is '=', value is 'engineer'. \n\nWait, the value parameters are strings. So even though age is a number, in the function, the value is passed as a string. That's probably because the database might store it as a string, or the function expects string inputs. So I'll set value as '25' for age and 'engineer' for job.\n\nPutting it all together, the function call should have table 'user' and conditions array with both conditions.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that each roll of a fair six-sided die is an independent event. The probability of getting a six on a single roll is 1/6. Since they want two sixes in a row, I need to multiply the probability of each individual event. So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the functions provided, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters. The function requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides which defaults to 6. The user specified a six-sided die, so die_sides is 6. The desired_number is 6, and number_of_rolls is 2. \n\nSo I should call the function with these parameters. The required parameters are desired_number and number_of_rolls, which are both provided. Die_sides is optional but since it's six, including it makes sense. Therefore, the function call should be probability.dice_roll with desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, die_sides=6.

The interest rate needs to be in decimal form. The user said 5%, so that's 0.05. The duration is 2 years. The function also has an optional parameter 'compounded' which defaults to 1.
