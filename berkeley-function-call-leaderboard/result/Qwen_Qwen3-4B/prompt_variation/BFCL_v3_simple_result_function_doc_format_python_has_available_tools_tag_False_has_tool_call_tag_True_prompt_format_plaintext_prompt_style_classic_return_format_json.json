Since those are the parameters, I can plug those into the function. The gravity can stay at the default. So the function call should include height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. Wait, but the user didn't mention gravity, so maybe we can omit it since it's the default. But maybe it's better to include it explicitly to avoid any confusion. Or maybe the function will use the default if not provided. Let me check the function definition again.\n\nThe function's args: height is required, initial_velocity has a default of zero, gravity has a default of 9.81. So in the parameters, since the user provided height=150 and initial_velocity=0, which are the first two parameters. Gravity is optional. So the function call would be calculate_final_velocity with height=150 and initial_velocity=0. The gravity will use the default. So the JSON should have those two parameters.

The user wants to find records in the user table where age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'. The available function is database.query, which takes table and conditions. The table is 'user' here. The conditions are age > 25 and job = 'engineer'. So I need to structure the conditions list properly. Each condition should be a dictionary with key and value. Wait, the function's parameters say conditions is a list of conditions. So maybe each condition is a dictionary like {\"column\": \"value\"}? Or maybe a list of tuples? The documentation isn't clear, but looking at the function definition, the parameters for database.query are table (str) and conditions (list). So the conditions should be a list of condition dictionaries. For example, for age > 25, it would be {\"age\": 25} but with an operator. Wait, maybe the conditions are in the form of a list of dictionaries where each dict has 'column', 'operator', and 'value'? Or perhaps the conditions are a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But the function's parameters don't specify, so I need to infer based on common practices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of tuples where each tuple is (column, operator, value). But the function's parameters are described as conditions (list), so perhaps each condition is a dictionary with 'column', 'operator', and 'value'. For example, for age > 25, it would be {\"column\": \"age\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": 25}, and for job = 'engineer', it's {\"column\": \"job\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}. Then, the conditions list would contain both of these dictionaries. But I'm not sure if the function expects that format. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". However, the function's parameters don't specify, so I need to make an assumption here.\n\nLooking back at the function's docstring: the conditions are for the query. So perhaps the conditions are a list of strings representing the WHERE clause conditions. For example, [\"age > 25\", \"job = 'engineer'\"]. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of dictionaries with keys like 'column' and 'value', and the operator is inferred. But without more information, I have to make a best guess.\n\nIn many SQL query builders, conditions are often passed as a list of dictionaries with 'column', 'operator', and 'value'. So I'll proceed with that. Therefore, the conditions list would be:\n\n[\n    {\"column\": \"age\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": 25},\n    {\"column\": \"job\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}\n]\n\nBut the function's parameters for conditions are a list, so that's acceptable. Therefore, the function call would be database.query with table 'user' and conditions as the list above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of tuples, but the function's parameters don't specify. Since the user's question is to find records where age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer', the correct way is to pass both conditions. So the final answer would be to call the database.query function with table 'user' and conditions as the two conditions mentioned."}

Since they want this to happen twice in a row, I need to multiply the probability of getting a six on the first roll by the probability of getting a six on the second roll. So that's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's a probability.dice_roll function. The parameters required are desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional, default 6). The user's question specifies a six-sided die, so die_sides is 6.

The company is Google. The start_date is after January 1, 2021. Wait, the function's start_date parameter expects a date in MM-DD-YYY format. The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021? But the function might accept a date range, but the parameter is a single start date. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and end date, but the description says \"date range\" but the args only have start_date. Wait, looking back: the function's description says \"within a specific date range\" but the args only have start_date. That might be an inconsistency. Wait, the function's args are start_date (str) and location. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not specified? Or maybe the user is supposed to input the start date as the beginning of the range. The user's query says \"filed after January 1, 2021\", so perhaps the start_date should be January 2, 2021.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the start_date as the beginning of the range, and the end date is not part of the parameters.

But given the function's parameters, perhaps the user is supposed to input the start date as the earliest date, and the end date is not part of the parameters. Wait, the function's args are start_date (str), location (str), and status (str). So maybe the function is designed to search from the start_date onwards. But the user's query says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 1, 2021, but the function might require the start date to be inclusive. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not part of the parameters. But the user's query is about lawsuits filed after that date, so perhaps the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the function will handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not required. But the user's query is about \"after\" that date, so maybe the start_date is set to January 1, 2021, and the function will return cases filed on or after that date. But the user said \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so perhaps the user is supposed to input the start_date as the earliest date. The function's description says \"within a specific date range\", but the parameters only have start_date. Maybe that's a mistake in the function definition. But given that, I have to work with what's provided. The user's query says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 1, 2021, but maybe the function is designed to take that as the start of the range. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not part of the parameters. So perhaps the user's query is to set the start_date to January 1, 2021, and the function will return cases filed on or after that date. But the user said \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so perhaps the user is supposed to input the start_date as the earliest date. So I'll proceed with start_date as \"01-01-2021\". Wait, but the user said \"after January 1, 2021\", which would mean starting from January 2. But maybe the function is designed to take the start date as the earliest date, so if the user wants after that date, they need to set the start_date to January 1, 2021, and the function will return cases filed on or after that date. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and end date, but the parameters are missing. But given the function's parameters, I have to proceed. So the parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'. But the user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the function will return cases filed on or after that date. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not required. So the correct parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'. But the user's query says \"after\", so perhaps the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and the function will return cases filed on or after that date. So that's the best approach.

So the parameters would be location: \"New York\", date: \"next month\", genre: \"pop\". That should cover all the required parameters. I think that's all. Let me make sure there are no missing parameters. The function requires all three: location, date, genre. The user provided all three, so the function call should be correct."}
