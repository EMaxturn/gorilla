But note, the question does not specify any sale condition.\n\n But observe: there is also a function `video_games.on_sale` that checks if a game is on sale. However, the question does not ask for whether it is on sale, but for the cheapest selling price.\n\n However, note that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current selling price. In the context, the current selling price might be the sale price if the game is on sale, or the regular price otherwise.\n\n Since the question does not specify any particular condition (like whether to consider sale or not) and we are only to get the price, we can directly call `video_games.store_price` for the given parameters.\n\n But note: the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. However, the PlayStation Store in the United States is a single store. So the price in that store is fixed? \n However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for the specified platform and region. So we can get the price by calling that function.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region of United States. But the question explicitly says United States, so we can set the region to 'United States'.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are to get the price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on the PlayStation Store in the United States.\n 2. We can use `video_games.store_price` with:\n    - game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n    - platform: 'PlayStation'\n    - region: 'United States'\n\n But note: the function `video_games.on_sale` might be used to check if the game is on sale? However, the question does not require that, and the price function should already reflect the sale price if on sale.\n\n However, the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. Since we are only checking one store (PlayStation Store in the US), the price we get is the only one? \n But note: the PlayStation Store might have different editions (like standard, deluxe, etc.) and the function does not specify edition. \n\n How do we handle multiple editions? The function `video_games.store_price` does not have an argument for edition. Therefore, we assume that the function returns the price for the standard edition or the base game? \n The problem does not specify. Since the function does not have an edition parameter, we can only get one price per call. \n\n But the question asks for the \"cheapest\" price. This implies there might be multiple versions? However, the function does not support multiple editions. \n\n Since the function does not have an edition parameter, we must assume that the function returns the price of the base game. \n\n Alternatively, if the function returns multiple prices (for different editions) then the return type would be an array or something? But the description doesn't say.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will assume the function returns the base game price. \n\n Therefore, we will call `video_games.store_price` for the base game.\n\n However, note: the question says \"cheapest selling price\". It might be that the base game is the cheapest? Or there might be a sale on a particular edition? \n\n But without an edition parameter, we cannot get the prices for different editions. So we are limited by the function.\n\n Therefore, we can only get the price for the base game? \n\n Alternatively, the function might return the lowest price among the available editions? The function description does not specify.\n\n Since we are constrained by the available functions, we will call the function as is and hope that it returns the cheapest available version (or the base game, which is usually the cheapest).\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function does not support multiple editions and we are only getting one price. \n\n Therefore, we will make the call and return the price we get.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` might be needed to know the currency? The question does not ask for currency, but the price is in the currency of the region. However, the question asks for the price without specifying currency. We assume the user is aware of the currency (USD for US). \n\n However, to be complete, we might also want to get the currency? The question only asks for the price. But the price is a number and the currency is implied by the region (US -> USD). \n\n So we can just return the price.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price, but we don't know if it returns as a float, string, etc. However, that is the function's return value.\n\n Steps:\n\n We will call:\n   video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region of United States. But since the question specifies United States, we can set it to 'United States' to be explicit.\n\n But wait: the function `video_games.store_price` has the parameter region with default 'United States'. So we can omit it? However, the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. But here the region is provided by the question (United States). \n\n Since the question specifies the region, we include it to be safe.\n\n However, note: the function definition says the region is a string and default is 'United States'. So we can pass it.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` is for getting the currency. We are not asked for the currency, so we don't need to call it.\n\n However, if we want to return the price with currency, we might need to get the currency? But the question does not ask for the currency. It only says \"selling price\". So we can just return the number? \n\n But the user might expect the currency? The question does not specify. However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price (presumably a number) and the currency is implied by the region (which is US -> USD). \n\n Therefore, we can just get the price.\n\n Alternatively, to be safe and provide complete information, we could get the currency and then format the price? But the question only asks for the cheapest selling price. \n\n Since the question does not specify the currency, and the region is US, we can assume USD. \n\n Therefore, we make one function call.\n\n However, note: the question says \"cheapest\". But we are only getting one price (for the base game). So we are returning that as the cheapest? \n\n We must note that if there are multiple editions, we cannot get them. So we return the price we get.\n\n Alternatively, we might call the function multiple times for different editions? But the function does not take an edition parameter. So we cannot.\n\n Therefore, we call the function once.\n\n But wait: what if the base game is not the cheapest? For example, there might be a sale on the deluxe edition? We cannot know without the edition. \n\n Given the constraints of the function, we have to assume that the function returns the lowest price among the available editions? Or the base game? The function description does not specify. \n\n Since the function is named `store_price` and takes a game_title, it might return the base game. \n\n Alternatively, the function might return the price for the most common edition? \n\n Without more information, we proceed with the base game.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.on_sale` might be used to check if there is a sale? But the question does not ask for sale status. \n\n Therefore, we will call `video_games.store_price`.\n\n Let's write the function call:\n\n Function name: video_games.store_price\n Parameters:\n   game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' (string)\n   platform: 'PlayStation' (string)\n   region: 'United States' (string) [we set it explicitly]\n\n We note that the region has a default, but we are providing it.\n\n Now, we must output in the specified XML format.\n\n Important: The type for each parameter must be set. All are strings.\n\n So:\n   <TOOLCALL>\n     <functions>\n       <function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n         <params>\n           <param name=\"game_title\" value=\"Assassins Creed Valhalla\" type=\"string\"/>\n           <param name=\"platform\" value=\"PlayStation\" type=\"string\"/>\n           <param name=\"region\" value=\"United States\" type=\"string\"/>\n         </params>\n       </function>\n     </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a default region. We are providing it anyway.\n\n However, what if the function does not require the region to be provided? Then it will use the default. But we are providing it to be explicit.\n\n Alternatively, we could omit the region and let the function use the default? But the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters, point it out. But the question does provide the region (United States). So we must provide it? \n\n Actually, the question says: \"in the United States\". So we have the region. We provide it.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_currency` is not called because we are not returning the currency.\n\n However, if we wanted to return the currency as well, we might call it? But the question does not ask for it.\n\n We stick to one function call.\n\n But note: the user might be interested in the currency? The question does not specify. We assume the user knows the currency for the region.\n\n Therefore, we return the function call for `video_games.store_price`."}

The allowed types are: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, tuple.\n\n The list `['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack']` is an array (list) of strings, so we use type=\"array\".\n The order is a string, so we use type=\"string\".\n\n Therefore, the function call will be:\n   <function name=\"sort_list\">\n      <param name=\"elements\" value=\"['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack']\" type=\"array\"/>\n      <param name=\"order\" value=\"asc\" type=\"string\"/>\n   </function>\n\n But note: the value for an array must be represented as a string that can be evaluated? \n However, the specification says we have to put the value in the value attribute.

And we are to put the value in the value attribute.\n\n However, the system that processes the TOOLCALL will parse the value according to the type. For type=\"array\", the value should be a string that can be parsed as a JSON array? Or a Python literal? \n\n But note: the example in the problem does not specify how to represent non-primitive types. We are to represent the value as a string that the backend can parse.\n\n Since the function is defined in Python, we can use the Python literal representation. But to be safe, we can use JSON which is a subset.\n\n However, the problem does not specify. We'll use a string that represents the list in a way that the function can use.\n\n But note: the function call is being generated for a system that expects the value as a string that can be evaluated to the correct type.\n\n We'll represent the list as: \"['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack']\" but note that this is not valid JSON because JSON requires double quotes. \n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes inside: '[\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]' but then the type is array and the system will parse it.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact serialization. Let's assume the system can handle a Python-like representation.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a JSON string: \n   value='[\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]' \n\n But note: the function is implemented in Python and will use `json.loads` or `ast.literal_eval`? We are not told.\n\n To avoid confusion, we should note that the function expects a list. We are representing the array as a string that must be parsed.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the value fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\" \n But then in the function call, we are using the type attribute to indicate the type of the parameter. The value attribute is always a string? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n And the example: \n   <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n So the value is always in a string. Therefore, we must represent the list as a string.\n\n How? We can use a JSON string. Let's do:\n\n   value = '[\"Sam\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]'\n\n But note: the function `sort_list` is defined to take a list. The backend will convert the string to a list by parsing the JSON.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says that the function is defined in Python. The system might use `eval`? But that is unsafe.\n\n However, the problem does not specify. We'll follow the convention: represent the array as a JSON string.\n\n But wait: the function `filter_list` also takes a list. How are we to represent it?\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we are to return in the specified XML format, we'll represent the list as a string that is a JSON array.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent it as a string that is a Python literal?

However, the function has a default for period, so we can provide only the room.\n\n But the tool call format we are using must include the parameters we want to set. We are allowed to skip optional parameters? The problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" Since the period is optional (has a default), we are not required to provide it. However, the tool call must be in the exact format with the parameters we are passing. So we can pass only the room.\n\n However, the function signature in the docstring shows two parameters. We must pass at least the required ones. The docstring doesn't mark which are required and which are optional, but the period has a default. So we can pass only the room? But note: the function in the list is defined with two parameters. We are not sure if the function can be called without the period. Since the problem says the function has a default, we can assume that we can omit it. But the tool call format we are using requires that we specify each parameter we are passing. We are only passing one.\n\n Alternatively, we can pass the period as the default value? But the problem does not specify what the default string is. The docstring says: period (str): The period over which to check the paint color trend. Default 'Daily'. So we can set period='Daily'. But the user might want the current trend, which might be better captured by a more recent period. Since the function's default is 'Daily', we can rely on that and omit it? But the tool call format does not allow omitting optional parameters? Actually, the tool call format we are using requires that we specify each parameter we want to pass. So if we don't specify period, then it won't be passed? But the function expects two parameters? \n\n How about we set period to 'Daily'? That is the default. We can do that to be explicit.\n\n However, note the function name: `paint_color.trends` - the docstring says `paint_color.trends` but in the function list it's written as `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function list has: `paint_color.trends`? Let me check:\n\n The provided function list says:\n   # Function: paint_color.trends\n\n But in the function header it's written as `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function name in the tool call must be exactly as provided. The provided function is named: `paint_color.trends`? But in the docstring the function name is written as `paint_color.trends`? There's a typo in the problem? The function is defined as `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function in the list is:\n\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n\n So we should use the name `paint_color.trends`.\n\n Let me re-read the function list:\n\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the most popular paint color for a specific area in the home. \n\n    Args:\n        room (str): Type of the room e.g. Living room, Bathroom etc.\n        period (str): The period over which to check the paint color trend. Default 'Daily'\n    \"\"\"\n\n So the function name is `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function name in the list is written as `paint_color.trends`? The first line says: `# Function: paint_color.trends`. So we will use `paint_color.trends`.\n\n Therefore, we will call:\n   function name: \"paint_color.trends\"\n   parameters:\n      room: \"Living room\"\n      period: \"Daily\"   (to use the default, but we can also try without? But the format requires we specify the parameters we are passing. We are required to pass the room. The period is optional but we can pass the default to be explicit.)\n\n However, note: the problem says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" The room is required and we have it. The period is optional and we have a default, so we can skip it? But the tool call format we are using must include the parameters we are passing. We are only passing room? How?\n\n The tool call format is:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"func_name1\">\n         <params>\n            <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n            ...\n         </params>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n We are only required to pass the parameters that we have. Since the period is optional, we can choose to omit it? But the function expects two arguments? Actually, in the function definition, the period has a default, so we can call it with one argument? But in the tool call, we are only allowed to pass the parameters that we have? The problem doesn't specify if we must pass all parameters or only the ones we have. However, the example in the instruction includes multiple parameters. We are required to pass the parameters by name.\n\n Since the period is optional, we can pass only the room. But note: the tool call format we are using requires that we specify each parameter we are passing. So we will only specify the room? But then the function might get called with only the room and use the default for period? \n\n Alternatively, we can pass the period as the default value. Since the user asks for \"currently\", the default period 'Daily' might be acceptable.\n\n Let's decide to pass both parameters to be safe? But the problem says if the question lacks the parameters, point it out. We have the room and we are inferring the period as the default. We are not lacking any required parameters.\n\n We are going to pass:\n   room: \"Living room\" (string)\n   period: \"Daily\" (string)   [since the default is daily, and we want current]\n\n However, note: the function's default is 'Daily', so we can also skip it. But the tool call format does not allow skipping a parameter? We are only required to pass the parameters we have. But the function has two parameters. We are missing one? Actually, the period is optional. So we are not missing it because it has a default.\n\n How to handle optional parameters? The tool call should only include the parameters we wish to pass. So we can choose to pass only the room? But the tool call format we are using requires that we list the parameters we are passing. We are passing only the room.\n\n But the format for the function call in the tool call must include the parameters we are setting. We are setting only the room. We are not setting period. So we can write:\n\n   <function name=\"paint_color.trends\">\n      <params>\n         <param name=\"room\" value=\"Living room\" type=\"string\"/>\n      </params>\n   </function>\n\n However, the function expects two parameters? But one of them has a default. So it's okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the period to the default value? The problem doesn't specify, so we can do either. But to be safe, let's pass the period as the default to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n But note: the problem says the period is default 'Daily'. So we can set period='Daily'. \n\n Let me do that.\n\n Therefore, the tool call:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"paint_color.trends\">\n         <params>\n            <param name=\"room\" value=\"Living room\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"period\" value=\"Daily\" type=\"string\"/>\n         </params>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note: the question asks for \"currently\", and the period 'Daily' might be too short. Maybe the function provider intended 'Daily' to mean the current day? But without more context, we follow the function's default.\n\n Alternatively, we might think that the user expects the trend for the current season or year? But the function does not offer those periods. We only have the period string, and the function might support only certain values? The docstring doesn't specify. We have to trust the function.\n\n Since the function's default is 'Daily', and the user says \"currently\", we use the default.\n\n Therefore, we make the call as above.\n\n But note: the function name must be exactly as provided. The function is named `paint_color.trends`? The function list says `paint_color.trends`. So we use that.\n\n However, in the function list, it's written as `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function list has:\n\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n\n So we use `paint_color.trends`.\n\n But wait, the function list has a typo? It says `paint_color.trends` but the function name in the docstring is `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function name in the docstring is the same as the function list? The function list says:\n\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n\n and then the docstring is inside. So the function name is `paint_color.trends`.\n\n However, in the function list, the function is defined as `paint_color.trends`? Actually, the function name in the tool call must be the one after `# Function: `.\n\n Therefore, we use `paint_color.trends`.\n\n But note: the function list has:\n\n    # Function: weather_forecast\n    # Function: paint_color.trends\n    # Function: house_price_trends\n\n So the function name for the paint color trends is `paint_color.trends`.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n   <function name=\"paint_color.trends\">\n\n Let's write the tool call accordingly."}

Let's break down the task:\n\n The task has the following components:\n   - Location: New York\n   - Art form: sculpture (and we can specify \"modern\" as part of the art form? or note that it's modern)\n   - Time: upcoming month (so we can use the default for month, which returns upcoming events)\n   - Rating: top rated -> we can set user_ratings to 'high' (which is the default) but note that the function 'find_exhibition' allows setting user_ratings.\n\n However, note that the function 'find_exhibition' has parameters:\n   - location (str): e.g., \"New York, NY\" -> we should use \"New York, NY\" for clarity?\n   - art_form (str): we can set to \"sculpture\", but note the task says \"modern sculpture\". We can try to include \"modern\" in the art_form? \n     Since the function doesn't have a parameter for era or style, we might have to rely on the art_form string. We can try \"modern sculpture\".\n\n Alternatively, the function might not support compound terms. But without knowing the backend, we can try to be descriptive.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can call 'find_exhibition' with:\n      location: \"New York, NY\"\n      art_form: \"modern sculpture\"   (to capture both the form and the style)\n      month: default (which is upcoming events) so we can omit or set to the current month? But the doc says default returns upcoming events -> so we can omit.\n      user_ratings: we want top rated, so we can set to 'high' (which is the default) -> so we can omit.\n\n However, note that the function 'find_exhibition' has a parameter 'month' which is a string and default returns upcoming. We can omit.\n\n But what if we want to be explicit? The problem says \"upcoming month\". Since the function by default returns upcoming events, we can leave it out.\n\n 2. However, the task asks for the top rated. The function 'find_exhibition' returns the most popular exhibitions. The parameter user_ratings has a default of 'high'. \n    We can set it to 'high' to ensure we get the top rated.\n\n 3. But note: the function returns the most popular, and we are using user_ratings='high'. We are not sure if it returns one or multiple. \n    The task says \"top rated\", which might imply the highest rated one. The function might return a list, but we are only asked for the top.\n\n 4. We don't have a function to sort by rating, but the function itself should return the top rated if we set user_ratings='high'. \n\n 5. However, we must note: the function 'find_exhibition' returns the most popular exhibitions. We are using user_ratings='high' to get the high rated ones.\n\n 6. We are not given a function to get more details about the exhibition, but we have a function to get sculpture info by artist. However, the exhibition might feature multiple artists? \n    The task doesn't ask for the artwork details, just the exhibition. So we might not need to call get_sculpture_info.\n\n 7. Therefore, we can call 'find_exhibition' with the parameters we have.\n\n But note: the function 'find_exhibition' expects:\n   location: string -> \"New York, NY\" (we can use this to be safe, as it might be the format expected)\n   art_form: string -> we set to \"modern sculpture\"\n   user_ratings: we set to 'high' (to be explicit, even though it's default, but to ensure we get top rated)\n\n However, what if the backend doesn't recognize \"modern sculpture\"? We have to try.\n\n Alternatively, we can call without the style and then filter? But we don't have a function to filter. So we rely on the function.\n\n Since we cannot chain functions arbitrarily (we are limited to the provided ones) and we don't have a function for exhibitions by style, we must use the art_form parameter.\n\n Let's call the function with the parameters:\n\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\" and hope that the backend considers modern? \n   OR we can try \"modern sculpture\"\n\n But the function description doesn't specify how the art_form is used. We have to try.\n\n We'll try \"modern sculpture\". If that doesn't work, we might have to adjust in a subsequent call? But we can only call the functions we have.\n\n Alternatively, note that the task says \"modern sculpture exhibition\". We are searching for an exhibition that features modern sculpture.\n\n Since we don't have any other function to help, we call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n However, the function also has a parameter 'month'. We are not setting it, so it will use the default (upcoming events).\n\n But note: the function 'find_exhibition' returns the most popular exhibitions. We are setting user_ratings to 'high'. \n\n We are not sure if the function returns one or multiple. The task says \"the top rated\", so we are interested in the top one? \n But the function doesn't have a parameter for the number of results. So we take what it returns and then we can pick the first? \n However, we are only allowed to call functions and we cannot process the data arbitrarily. \n\n Since the system will return the results, we assume the function returns a list of exhibitions and we can then present the top one? \n But note: we are only making the function call. The system will return the data. We don't have a function to sort or filter the results.\n\n We have to trust that the function returns the exhibitions in order of popularity/rating.\n\n Therefore, we make the call.\n\n However, note: the function 'find_exhibition' might return multiple. But the user asked for the top rated. We are setting user_ratings='high', which should only return high rated ones? \n And then the most popular (which is the function's purpose) should be the top one.\n\n So we make the call.\n\n But wait: what if the function 'find_exhibition' does not support the art_form \"modern sculpture\"? We might get no results? \n We don't have a way to know without calling. We'll call and see what happens.\n\n However, we are only allowed to output one set of tool calls. We are to make the call and then the system will respond.\n\n We'll make the call to 'find_exhibition' with the parameters above.\n\n But note: the function has a parameter 'month'. We are not setting it, so it will be the default (which is the upcoming events). That matches \"upcoming month\".\n\n Therefore, we call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n However, the parameter names and types must be correct.\n\n We are going to write the function call in the required XML format.\n\n But note: the function name is \"find_exhibition\", and the parameters are:\n   location: string -> \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: string -> \"modern sculpture\"\n   user_ratings: string -> \"high\"\n\n We don't set month because we are using the default.\n\n However, the function definition for 'find_exhibition' has:\n   month (str): The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\n\n So we are safe to omit.\n\n But note: the function also has a parameter 'user_ratings' that we are setting to \"high\". The default is 'high'. So we could omit? \n However, to be explicit and ensure we get top rated (which is high), we set it.\n\n Alternatively, we might set it to the highest possible? The function doesn't specify the levels. It says default is 'high'. \n We are not sure if there are levels like 'medium', 'low'. Since the task says top rated, we set to 'high'.\n\n We'll set it.\n\n Therefore, the function call:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n     <functions>\n         <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n             <params>\n                 <param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n                 <param name=\"art_form\" value=\"modern sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n                 <param name=\"user_ratings\" value=\"high\" type=\"string\"/>\n             </params>\n         </function>\n     </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function also has a parameter for 'month'.
