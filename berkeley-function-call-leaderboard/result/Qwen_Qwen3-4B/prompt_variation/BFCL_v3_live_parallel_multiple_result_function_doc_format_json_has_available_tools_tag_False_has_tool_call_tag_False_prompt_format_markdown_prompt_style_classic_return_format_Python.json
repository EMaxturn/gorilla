Maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each skill. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple skills if they're combined somehow, but the parameters don't allow that.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push changes. \n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function clone_repo requires repo_url. So I'll call clone_repo with that URL. The destination is not specified, so default to current directory.\n\nNext, step 2.1: analyse the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents needs directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, maybe the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'? Wait, the clone command's destination is the current directory, so the repo would be in the current working directory. But the function parameters for analyse_repo_contents require the directory_name as a path relative to the root. So maybe the directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'?\n\nOnce analysed, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs directory_name. Again, probably the same directory as the repo. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen step 2.2: create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name, which is the same. The parameters for that function include deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user didn't specify, so use defaults. Deployment name defaults to directory_name, image is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\nStep 3: add all changed files to git. The function push_git_changes_to_github has a parameter 'directory_name' which is the repo dir. But wait, the push function is for pushing changes, but step 3 says 'add all changed files to git changes'. Wait, the push function does git add automatically. But maybe the user wants to add changes first. However, the available functions don't have a 'git add' function. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe step 3 is handled by the push function. But the user says 'add all changed file to git changes' which is git add. However, the available function is push_git_changes_to_github, which does git add. So perhaps call that function with directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The user didn't specify the commit message, so default is 'Update changes'. Branch is main by default. Force push is false.\n\nStep 4: commit and push. Wait, the push function does both commit and push? Or is there a separate commit function? The available functions don't have a commit function. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes and then push. So maybe the push function handles both adding and pushing. So step 4 is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes (git add), and step 4 is commit and push. But the available functions don't have a commit function. The push function does git add and then push. So maybe the user's steps 3 and 4 are combined into one call to push_git_changes_to_github. But the user's step 3 is adding changes, and step 4 is commit and push. However, the function push_git_changes_to_github does git add, commit, and push. So perhaps the user's steps 3 and 4 are covered by that function. But the user might have intended to first add changes (git add) and then commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a separate commit function. So the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the appropriate parameters.\n\nSo the functions to call are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' (defaults for other parameters)\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main'\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says 'add all changed file to git changes' which is git add. But the push function does that. So maybe the user's steps 3 and 4 are handled by the push function. However, the user's step 4 is to commit and push. But the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So perhaps the push function does the git add, commit, and push. Therefore, the correct sequence is:\n\nAfter cloning, analyse, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes (git add), and step 4 is commit and push. However, the available function is push_git_changes_to_github, which does git add, commit, and push. So the user's steps 3 and 4 are covered by that function. Therefore, the functions to call are:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut need to check if the parameters are correct. For example, the directory_name for analyse_repo_contents is the directory where the repo is located. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome'? Or is the directory the same as the repo's name? The repo is cloned from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so the directory would be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main')\n\nBut the user's step 3 says 'add all changed file to git changes', which is git add. The push function does that. So the push function is called after creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. So the order is correct."}

The appropriate function here is 'get_relevant_classes' with the search_string set to 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories set to True.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.

The unit is cm, but the function's parameter is just a float, so 5.0 should be fine.

Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. That might be a mistake. However, the function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. The user said Queenstown Singapore, which is a bit confusing. But maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore by mistake. However, the function's parameters accept 'City, Country' format, so perhaps the user intended Queenstown, Singapore. But that's a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe they meant Singapore's weather. But the question says Queenstown Singapore. Hmm. Well, the function can take 'City, Country' as a parameter, so I'll use 'Queenstown, Singapore' as the location. The unit isn't specified, so the default is fahrenheit. But the user didn't specify, so the function will use the default. \n\nSo, I need to call two functions: get_area_of_square with size 5, and get_current_weather with location 'Queenstown, Singapore'. \n\nWait, but the user might have made a typo. Queenstown is in New Zealand, not Singapore. But the question says Queenstown Singapore. Maybe they meant Singapore's weather. But the question is a bit ambiguous.
