The URL is the endpoint, and the params are the query parameters. The user's question includes the IP, but the function's parameters don't have an IP. So maybe the URL is fixed, and the IP is part of the URL. But the user's question says to use the IP, so perhaps the URL should include the IP. But the function's example URL doesn't have the IP. Hmm, maybe the base path is fixed, and the IP is part of the URL. But the user's question specifies the IP, so perhaps the URL should include it. However, the function's parameters don't have an IP. So maybe the URL is fixed, and the IP is part of the URL. But the user's question says to use the IP, so perhaps the URL is correct. Alternatively, maybe the IP is part of the URL. But since the function's parameters don't include it, perhaps the URL is correct as per the example, and the IP is part of the URL. But the user's question says to use the IP, so maybe the URL should include it. But the function's parameters don't have an IP. This is a bit confusing. However, the user's question includes the IP, so perhaps the URL should include it. But since the function's parameters don't have an IP, maybe the URL is fixed, and the IP is part of the URL.
