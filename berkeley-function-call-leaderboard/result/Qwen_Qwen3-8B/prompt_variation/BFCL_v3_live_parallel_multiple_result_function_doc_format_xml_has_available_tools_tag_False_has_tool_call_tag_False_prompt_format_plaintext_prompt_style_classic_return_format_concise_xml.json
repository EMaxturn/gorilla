The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user specified a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires the foodItem name. The parameters include newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I should set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The foodItem is \"Caesar salad\". No new ingredients are added, so newIngredients can be omitted. Special instructions might not be needed here, but maybe \"without anchovies\" could go there, but the parameter is for other instructions. So better to use removeIngredients.\n\nThen the drink order 123. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences are size: large, type: hot coffee, sweetness: regular, milk: almond. So the new_preferences dict should include these. Wait, the function's new_preferences is a dict, so I need to structure it properly. Maybe like {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nCheck if all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required. For ChaDri, drink_id and new_preferences are required. Both are provided. So two function calls are needed here."}

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll omit that. No need for recursive or depth parameters here.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome'. This will determine the predominant language, which might be Node.js.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Using the same directory name as before. Wait, the function's parameter is directory_name, which should be a path relative to the repo root. So if the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be '.' or the folder name. But the function's description says it's the name of the repository directory. Maybe it's the folder name, so 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name again. Same as before. The other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc., aren't specified, so use defaults. The image name might default to 'latest', and deployment name could be the directory name. Replicas, port, service_type might default to common values like 1, 80, and 'ClusterIP' unless specified otherwise.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user didn't specify a commit message or branch, so maybe use defaults or omit them. The commit message could be 'Add Docker and Kubernetes files', and branch might be 'main' or 'master'. Force push is probably not needed unless specified.\n\nWait, the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push function automatically git adds changes, so maybe after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name and a commit message. The branch name might be required, but if not provided, maybe the function has a default. But the parameters are optional. So I'll include directory_name and a commit message, maybe 'Add Docker and Kubernetes files', and assume branch is 'main' or leave it out if possible.\n\nPutting it all together: first clone, then analyze, then create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. Each step requires the directory name, which is 'nodejs-welcome' after cloning. Let me check the parameters again to make sure.\n\nFor clone_repo, repo_url is given. Then analyse_repo_contents with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'. Then create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'. Then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with same directory_name. Finally, push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name and commit message. The branch name might be optional, so maybe omit it unless required. The user didn't specify, so perhaps leave it out. Force_push is false by default. So the functions should be called in order."}

The class StringNumberHandler extends AbstractCellHandler and overrides methods like getCellValue, setCellValue, getExcelType, and getDefaultExcelFormat. The error is about the method getNumericValue() not being found in CellResult.\n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to CellResult, including subdirectories. The get_relevant_classes function seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I'll set include_subdirectories to true. The search_string should be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. I'll need to call this twice, once for each method. For each call, the class_name is AbstractCellHandler, and the method_name is setCellValue and getCellValue respectively. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe the include_private parameter should be considered, but since the methods are overridden, they might be public. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe leave include_private as default (false) unless needed.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error about getNumericValue() in CellResult. Maybe CellResult doesn't have that method, so they need to check if there's a related class that does. But the first part of the query is to find classes related to CellResult, so using get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories true should help find possible classes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Call get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\", include_subdirectories true.\n2. Call get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue.\n3. Call get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's getCellValue.\n\nThat should address both parts of the user's request: finding related classes and getting the method signatures."}

I'll need to call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, is Queenstown a city in Singapore? I think there's a Queenstown in Singapore, but maybe the function expects the location in a specific format. The example formats are like 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. So I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit parameter is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I can omit it or set a default. Since the function allows it, I'll include the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore' and leave unit out unless required. \n\nWait, the function's parameters: location is required, unit is optional.

The parameters needed are event_type, city, and date. The user specified \"music concerts or theater plays,\" so I should use \"concert\" and \"play\" as event types. But the function might require a single event_type. Wait, the function's event_type is a string, so maybe I need to handle both. However, the function might not support multiple types at once. Maybe I should call it twice, once for each event type. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants both, so I need to check if the function can take multiple values. But looking at the parameters, it's a single string. So maybe I need to make two separate calls: one for concerts and one for plays. \n\nThe city is Los Angeles, and the date is 2023-03-10. The function's date parameter is optional, but the user specified a date, so I should include it. \n\nSo first call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type \"concert\", city \"Los Angeles, CA\", date \"2023-03-10\".

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so I'll use that as the city. They didn't mention unisex, so maybe the is_unisex parameter can be omitted or set to 'dontcare'. But the function's parameters require is_unisex to be a boolean or 'dontcare'. Wait, the description says the is_unisex param can be True, False, or dontcare. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should include 'dontcare' as the value. But the function's required field for is_unisex is false, so it's not mandatory. So I can just provide the city and leave is_unisex out.
