First, I need to check the available functions. The function provided is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time.\n\nThe user specified the address as 123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704. The function's loc parameter expects a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The given address includes the street, city, state, and ZIP code. But the example in the function's description uses 'Address, City, State' without the ZIP. However, the user's address includes the ZIP, so maybe it's acceptable to include it. Alternatively, maybe the ZIP is part of the state abbreviation? Wait, CA is the state, and 94704 is a ZIP code. But the function's example uses 'Springfield, IL', so perhaps the ZIP is not required. But the user provided it, so I should include it as part of the address. So the loc parameter would be '123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704'.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which is in the enum ['plus', 'comfort', 'black']. So the type parameter should be 'plus'.\n\nThe time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So time=10.\n\nSo the function call should be uber.ride with loc='123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704', type='plus', time=10. I need to make sure all required parameters are included. Yes, loc, type, time are all there. The ZIP code might be okay even though the example doesn't include it. The function's parameters don't specify that ZIP is required, just the city and state. But the user provided the full address, so including the ZIP is probably correct."}

The parameters for get_movies include city (required), cinema_hall (optional), movie_date (optional, default current date), movie_language (optional), and movie_format (optional, default 2D). Since the user didn't mention any filters like cinema hall, language, or format, I can omit those. So the function call should be get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date. Wait, the default for movie_date is the current date, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different date. But the user said \"today,\" so maybe it's safer to include it explicitly. Let me check the function's default. The description says the default is the current date, so if I don't include movie_date, it will use today's date. However, the user is asking specifically for today, so including it makes it clear. But since the default is already today, maybe it's redundant. However, the system bot should calculate the current date in India. So the function call would be get_movies(city='Mumbai'). The other parameters are optional and not provided, so they can be left out. Therefore, the correct function call is get_movies with city set to Mumbai."}

The start_available_date should be '2024-03-12 16:00:00' and end_available_date should be '2024-03-12 18:00:00'. \n\nWait, the function parameters for start_available_date and end_available_date are strings in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format. So I need to format the dates accordingly. \n\nPutting it all together, the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=3, rating=4.5, start_available_date='2024-03-12 16:00:00', and end_available_date='2024-03-12 18:00:00'. \n\nI should check if all required parameters are included. The required parameter is service_id, which is provided. The other parameters are optional but necessary here. \n\nSo the final function call should be get_service_providers with those parameters."}

The user is looking for a housewife who provides ironing services in Chiang Mai, specifically in Sankampang District and Ton Pao Subdistrict, with a 4.5 star rating.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function provided is getDataForProfessional. The parameters required are service_id, province_id, and optionally district_name, sub_district_name, rating, etc.\n\nThe service type is ironing, which according to the enum in the function is service_id 2. Province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district is Sankampang, and the sub-district is Ton Pao. The rating needed is 4.5. \n\nSo I need to map these details into the function parameters. The required parameters are service_id and province_id, which are 2 and 2 respectively. Then, district_name is Sankampang, sub_district_name is Ton Pao, and rating is 4.5. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't specified, so they can be left as default. Also, has_late_check_in is optional and defaults to False, which is acceptable unless the user specifies otherwise. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention availability dates, so those can be omitted. The function allows for optional parameters, so including district and sub-district names is necessary here. The rating is 4.5, which is within the 0.0-5.0 range. \n\nSo the correct function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the professionals meeting those criteria."}
