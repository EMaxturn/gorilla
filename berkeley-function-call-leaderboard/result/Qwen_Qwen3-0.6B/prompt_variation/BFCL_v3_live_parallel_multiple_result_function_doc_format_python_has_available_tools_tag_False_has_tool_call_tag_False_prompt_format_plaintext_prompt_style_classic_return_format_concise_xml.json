The user wants to perform several actions on a GitHub repository. First, they need to clone the repo. The first step is to use the clone_repo function. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The destination parameter is not specified, so I'll use the default which is the current working directory.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. The default directory is probably the same as the cloned repo, so I'll use the directory name from the clone step. Wait, the clone step's destination is the current directory, so the directory name here would be the same. So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Since the directory is the same as the cloned repo, I'll use that. Also, the default for the directory is the same, so I can leave it as is.\n\nNext, create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name. The default is the same as the cloned repo, so I'll use that. The parameters here include deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user hasn't specified these, so I'll use defaults unless provided. Wait, the user's steps mention creating the Kubernetes YAMLs, but the parameters are not all provided. So I need to make sure to include all the parameters if they are optional. For example, the default for image_name is 'latest', so I'll use that. The replicas and port are defaults, so I'll leave them as is.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name, commit message, branch name, and force push. The user hasn't provided the commit message or branch name, so I'll use default values. The default commit message is 'Update changes', and the default branch is 'main'. The force push is default False, so I'll leave it as is.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push function does that by default. So maybe the commit message and branch are not needed. But since the user hasn't specified them, I have to use defaults. So the push function call will have those defaults.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with the given URL and default destination.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with the directory name (same as cloned repo).\n3. create_a_docker_file with the directory name.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory name, defaults for parameters.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with defaults.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly with the parameters. Let me check the parameters again. For clone_repo, the parameters are repo_url, destination, recursive, depth. The user provided the URL, so repo_url is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. The destination is default, so no need to specify. For analyse_repo_contents, the directory_name is the same as the cloned repo. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is same. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same. For push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is same, commit message default, branch default, force push default.\n\nSo the function calls should be:\n\n<functions>\nclone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\", destination=\".\") \nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\")\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\")\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\")\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\", commit_message=\"Update changes\", branch_name=\"main\", force_push=False)\n</functions>\n\nI think that covers all the steps. Let me check if any parameters are missing. The destination is default, so no need. The directory_name for all functions is the same. The parameters for the functions are correctly set. So this should be the correct answer."}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the 'get_relevant_classes' function seems relevant. The parameters for that function include a search string, case sensitivity, and include subdirectories. The search string should be 'CellResult' to find related classes. The case sensitivity parameter can be set to true if the user wants case-sensitive search, but since the error is about 'CellResult', maybe case-sensitive is needed. The include_subdirectories parameter should be set to true to include subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can be used here. The parameters for that function are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The class_name here is 'AbstractCellHandler', the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private flag should be set to true if the methods are private, but the user didn't mention that. However, since the error is about 'getCellValue' and 'setCellValue', maybe the methods are private, so including private is necessary. But the user might not have specified, so perhaps the default is okay. The function call would be for both methods.\n\nSo, the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search 'CellResult' and include subdirectories, then call get_signature for both 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' with include_private set to true. Also, check if the parameters are correctly set. The user might need to adjust the parameters based on their actual code, but the functions provided are the best options here."}

So I'll call get_area_of_square with size 5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location parameter. The user mentioned Queenstown Singapore, so I'll set location to \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The unit isn't specified, so I'll leave it as the default 'fahrenheit' if it's not provided.

So the first function call is Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex 'dontcare'.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the user provided the salon name as 'Elegant Styles', the time as '15:00' and the date as '2023-05-10'. The Services_1_BookAppointment function requires stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. So the parameters would be stylist_name 'Elegant Styles', appointment_time '15:00', and appointment_date '2023-05-10'. So the second function call is Services_1_BookAppointment with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the date format in the function's parameters is 'YYYY-MM-DD', which matches the user's input. So both function calls are needed. Let me check again. The user's request is to search and book, so both functions must be called. The parameters for the first function are city and is_unisex, and for the second, stylist_name, time, date. So the answer should have both function calls in the required format."}
