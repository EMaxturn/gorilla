The first one, 'uber.ride', requires loc, type, and time. The parameters are in the right format. The user provided all three: loc is given, type is 'Plus', and time is 10. So that's all set.\n\nThe other function, 'uber.ride2', seems to be for weather, but the user isn't asking about weather. The parameters for 'uber.ride2' include loc, type, and time, but the description says it's for weather. Since the user's request is about Uber ride, 'uber.ride' is the correct one to use.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'type' as 'Plus' and time as 10. The 'uber.ride' function's parameters include 'type' with enum values plus, comfort, black. So 'Plus' is valid. The time is an integer, and 10 is correct.

{"id": "live_multiple_44-17-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user's request. They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided all these details.\n\nThe user mentioned the account number, bank name, account type (checking), full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING), and the dates. The transaction_overview includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided the beginning and ending balances, which are part of the transaction_overview. Wait, the parameters for BankStatementOverView require starting_balance and ending_balance, but the transaction_overview has total_deposits and total_withdrawals. Hmm, maybe the transaction_overview includes the totals, and the starting and ending balances are part of the overview. The user provided the beginning and ending balances, which are the starting_balance and ending_balance. So I can include those in the transaction_overview.\n\nSo the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n- bank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n- account_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n- account_type: \"checking\"\n- full_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n- transaction_overview: {\n    total_deposits: 5532.01 + 7132.76 = 12664.77? Wait, the user says the beginning balance was $5,532.01 and ending balance $6,737.37. The deposits are $7,132.76, and withdrawals $5,927.40. So total deposits would be 7132.76, total withdrawals 5927.40. The starting balance is 5532.01, ending balance 6737.37. So the transaction_overview should have total_deposits as 7132.76, total_withdrawals as 5927.40, start_date and end_date as October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019.\n\nWait, the user provided the beginning and ending balances, but the transaction_overview's total_deposits and total_withdrawals are separate. The user also mentioned other deposits totaling $7,132.76. So the total deposits would be that amount, and withdrawals are $5,927.40. The starting balance is 5532.01, ending balance 6737.37. So the transaction_overview would include those totals.\n\nSo the function call would be BankStatementOverView with the parameters. Also, the user wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and the customer's first and last name. The user provided all these details. So I need to call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions list, which would include the individual transaction details. But the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so maybe the function can generate it based on the totals and other info. However, the function requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided specific transactions, perhaps the function can generate a summary using the totals and other parameters. But the function's parameters include transactions as an array of dictionaries. Since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, maybe the function can generate a summary based on the given totals and dates. However, the function's parameters require the transactions array, which is not provided. Wait, the user's question includes the totals, but the function requires the transactions array. So maybe the function can be called with the totals and other parameters, but the transactions array is needed. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, perhaps the function can be called with the totals and other parameters, and the transactions array is generated based on the totals. However, the function's parameters require the transactions array, so maybe the assistant needs to generate that. But the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so perhaps the assistant can't generate the transactions array. Wait, the user's question includes the totals, but the function requires the transactions array. So maybe the assistant can't call the function without the transactions array. But the user might expect that the function can generate the summary based on the totals and other parameters. However, the function's parameters require the transactions array. Therefore, the assistant might need to call the function with the available parameters, but the transactions array is missing. But the user might have intended that the function can generate the summary using the totals and other info. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can call the BankStatementOverView function with the provided parameters and then call the transaction_summary.generate function with the totals and other parameters, even if the transactions array is not provided. But the function's parameters require the transactions array. So perhaps the assistant can't call the transaction_summary.generate function without the transactions array.

The user wants to find restaurants in New York that are tagged as intermediate priced and have outdoor seating. First, I need to check which functions are available. The available functions are Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, Restaurants_2_ReserveRestaurant, and RideSharing_2_GetRide.\n\nThe user's request is about finding restaurants, so the Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function is the right choice. The parameters required are category and location. The category should be 'Intermediate' since they mentioned intermediate priced. The location is New York. The user also wants outdoor seating, so the has_seating_outdoors parameter should be set to True. The price_range needs to be 'intermediate', but looking at the enum values, the price_range options are 'cheap', 'moderate', 'pricey', 'ultra high-end'. The user said 'intermediate', but the enum doesn't have that. Wait, the enum for price_range is given as ['cheap', 'moderate', 'pricey', 'ultra high-end'], so 'intermediate' isn't listed. Hmm, maybe the user meant 'moderate' as the price range. But the user specifically said 'intermediate', so maybe there's a mistake. However, the function's parameters have price_range with those options. So perhaps the user made a typo, but I have to follow the given options. Alternatively, maybe the function allows 'moderate' as the default, but the user wants intermediate. But since the enum doesn't have intermediate, I can't set it. Wait, the user said 'intermediate priced for cost', but the function's price_range enum doesn't include that. So maybe the user intended 'moderate' as the price range. But the user's exact wording is 'intermediate', so I need to check if that's allowed. Since it's not in the enum, perhaps the function doesn't support that. But the user might have a different way to specify. However, according to the given function parameters, the price_range is an enum with the listed options. So I can't set it to 'intermediate'. Therefore, maybe the user's request can't be fully met, but I have to proceed with the available options. Alternatively, maybe the user meant 'moderate' and that's the intended price range. But the user explicitly said 'intermediate', so I have to include that. But since it's not in the enum, perhaps the function will not accept it. However, the function's parameters have a default of 'moderate', but the user wants 'intermediate'. So maybe the function can't handle that. But the user's request is to include outdoor seating in New York with intermediate price. Since the price_range isn't in the enum, maybe the function can't be called as is. But the user might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the function allows 'intermediate' as a value, but the enum doesn't list it. Wait, the enum for price_range is ['cheap', 'moderate', 'pricey', 'ultra high-end'], so 'intermediate' isn't there. Therefore, the function can't be called with 'intermediate' as the price_range. So the user's request can't be fully satisfied. But the user might have intended 'moderate' as the price range. So perhaps the correct approach is to use 'moderate' as the price_range and set has_seating_outdoors to True. But the user specifically said 'intermediate'. However, since the function's parameters don't allow 'intermediate', I have to proceed with the available options. Therefore, the function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with category 'Intermediate', location 'New York', price_range 'moderate', and has_seating_outdoors True. But the user's request is to include intermediate priced, which isn't in the enum. So maybe the answer is that the function can't be called as per the parameters. But the user might have a different intention. Alternatively, maybe the function allows 'intermediate' as a value, but the enum doesn't list it. So the function can't be called. Therefore, the correct function call would be to use the available parameters, even if the price_range isn't exactly as requested. But the user's exact wording is important. So the answer would be to call the function with category 'Intermediate', location 'New York', price_range 'moderate', and has_seating_outdoors True. But the user might not have intended 'moderate' as the price range. However, given the constraints, that's the best possible."}

But the user might want to find songs similar to the album, which could be done by using the album parameter. However, the LookupMusic function's parameters include album, so the first call is for the album. The second call is for the year 2017, but maybe the user wants to find songs from that year. But the user said \"tracks released around six years ago\" which is 2017. So the second call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017' and maybe album='dontcare' to ignore the album. But the user didn't mention an album for that part. So maybe two separate calls: one for the album and one for the year. But the user might want both. However, the functions are separate. So the first call is LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. The second call is LookupMusic with year='2017' and maybe album='dontcare' to find tracks from that year.

So first, call FindMovies with genre='Action' and starring='Bruce Willis'. Then, once the titles are retrieved, select one and call PlayMovie with the title and maybe the subtitle language. But the user hasn't mentioned subtitles, so maybe just default to English. But the user might want to choose a language, but since they didn't specify, stick with the default. So first function call is Media_3_FindMovies with the parameters."}

The private_visibility is optional, defaulting to False, but the user wants it private, so I should set that to True.\n\nPayment_1_MakePayment requires payment_method, amount, receiver, and private_visibility.

So, I need to figure out which functions to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. The user wants to play a song from a specific album or from a specific year. The Music_3_PlayMedia function can play a track, but it requires the track title and maybe some parameters like device. However, the user hasn't specified a particular track, just the album and year. So maybe the LookupMusic function is better for finding songs that match the criteria.\n\nThe Music_3_LookupMusic function allows searching by artist, album, genre, and year. The user mentioned the album 'High Expectations' and the year 2019. So I can use this function with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get a list of songs. Once I have that list, I can choose one to play. But the problem is, the function returns a list, and I need to pick one. However, the user might want to play one of them immediately. But the functions don't have a way to select a specific song from the list. So maybe the user expects to first look up the songs and then play one. But the functions can't do that directly. Wait, the user's request is to \"hear a track\" which could mean playing one. But the functions don't have a play function that takes a list of songs. So perhaps the user needs to first use LookupMusic to get the songs and then use PlayMedia to play one. But the functions are separate. So the steps would be: call LookupMusic with album and year, then pick a song from the result and call PlayMedia with that song's title.\n\nBut the user's question is to make a single function call. However, the available functions don't allow for selecting a specific song from the lookup result. So maybe the user's request can't be fully fulfilled with the given functions. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with playing any song from 2019, so using LookupMusic with year=2019 and then PlayMedia with any of the songs. But the functions require specific parameters. So the correct approach would be to first call LookupMusic with the album and year, then use PlayMedia with the selected song. But since the user wants to hear a track, perhaps the answer is to call LookupMusic with the specified parameters and then PlayMedia with one of the songs. However, the user's question is to make function calls, not to process them step by step. So maybe the answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019', and then Music_3_PlayMedia with the first song from that lookup. But since the functions can't be called in sequence, perhaps the user expects to have both functions called. But the user's question is to \"hear a track\", so maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic and then PlayMedia. However, the problem is that the functions can't be called in sequence. The user might need to make two function calls. But according to the instructions, I need to return the function calls in the format specified. So the answer would be to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters and then Music_3_PlayMedia with the track title. But since the user hasn't provided a specific track, maybe the answer is to call LookupMusic with the album and year, and then PlayMedia with any song from that lookup. However, the functions don't allow for selecting a song from the lookup result. Therefore, the correct function calls would be to first call LookupMusic with the album and year, and then PlayMedia with one of the songs from that lookup. But since the user hasn't provided a specific track, the answer would involve two function calls. But the user's question is to \"hear a track\", so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls. Therefore, the answer would be to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019', and then Music_3_PlayMedia with the first song from that lookup. However, the functions can't be called in sequence, so the assistant must make both calls. But the user's question is to make the function calls, so the assistant should return both."}

The user is asking for the host count on February 15th, 2022. I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'get_hosts_per_day' which requires day, month, and year. The parameters are integers, and the month should be between 1 and 12. February is 2, so that's valid. The day is 15, which is within February's range (1-28 or 29 depending on leap year, but 15 is okay). The year is 2022, which is a leap year but 15 is still valid.\n\nAnother function is 'get_hosts_per_month', but that needs month and year, but the user is asking for a specific day, not the entire month. So 'get_hosts_per_day' is the right choice here.\n\nSo I need to call get_hosts_per_day with day=15, month=2, year=2022. The other parameters like include_subdomains and timeframe aren't needed here since the user didn't mention them. The default for timeframe is null, so it's okay to omit it.\n\nI should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as integers. The user's question is straightforward, so no missing parameters. Therefore, the function call should be get_hosts_per_day with the specified values."}

The user forgot all their API tokens and wants to be reminded. Their user ID is \"user123\".\n\nLooking at the available functions, there are two related to API tokens: get_api_tokens and post_api_token. The get_api_tokens function retrieves tokens associated with a user, and the post_api_token creates new ones. The user is asking to remind them of existing tokens, so the get_api_tokens function is the right choice here.\n\nThe parameters for get_api_tokens require user_id and include_expired. The user provided their user ID as \"user123\". The include_expired parameter has a default of False, but the user didn't specify whether they want expired tokens or not. Since they didn't mention it, maybe we should default to False unless told otherwise. But the function's default is already False, so maybe we can just call it with the user_id.\n\nSo the function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\". The include_expired is optional and defaults to False, so we don't need to include it unless specified. The other function, CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, is for custom dashboards, which the user didn't mention, so we can ignore that.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\"."}

The parameters needed are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients, and enabled. The threshold is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. The recipients are an array of emails. The enabled default is True, so maybe it's optional, but the user didn't specify, so including it would be safe.\n\nWait, the parameters for create_global_application_alert_config require 'name', 'alert_type', 'threshold', 'recipients', and 'enabled' is a default. So I need to call that function with those parameters. The alert_type is 'error_rate', threshold is 0.05, recipients are ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], and name is 'UrgentAlert77f7'. \n\nI should check if all required parameters are there. The required ones are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. Enabled is optional but included here. So the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with those values.

I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' which retrieves a list of API tokens. The parameters include 'include_expired' which defaults to False, 'page' with a default of 1, and 'page_size' defaulting to 20. The user wants all tokens, so maybe I need to adjust the parameters to get every page. Since the default page is 1 and page_size is 20, if there are more tokens than 20, I'll need to call the function multiple times with increasing page numbers. But the user didn't specify how many pages, so perhaps the function can handle it by defaulting to the first page. However, the user might want all tokens, so maybe the function can return all if the page_size is set to a higher number, but the maximum is 100. Wait, the default is 20, but the user wants all. So maybe the function can be called with page=1 and page_size=100 to get as many as possible. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, the function might return all tokens in the first page if the page_size is set to a higher value. But since the user wants all, perhaps the function needs to be called with page=1 and page_size=100. However, the parameters don't have a 'all' option. So the best approach is to call the function with page=1 and page_size=100 to get as many as possible. But the user might not have specified the page size, so maybe the default is sufficient. But the user wants all, so maybe the function can be called with page=1 and page_size=100. Alternatively, if the function returns all tokens in the first page, then that's enough. But since the user says \"all\", maybe the function needs to be called multiple times. However, the user might not know that, so the assistant should call the function with the default parameters and let the system handle it. But the user might need to be informed that more calls are needed. However, the instructions say to make function calls until the task is fulfilled. So the assistant should call the function with the default parameters, which are page=1 and page_size=20. But if the user wants all tokens, maybe the assistant should call the function with page=1 and page_size=100. But the parameters don't have a 'all' option. So the assistant should call the function with the default parameters and hope that it returns all tokens in the first page. Alternatively, if the user wants all, the assistant should call the function with page=1 and page_size=100. But since the user hasn't specified, the assistant should use the default parameters. However, the user might need to be informed that the function is called with the default parameters. So the correct function call would be to use 'api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens' with the default parameters. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe the assistant should call it with page=1 and page_size=100. But the parameters don't have a 'all' option. Therefore, the assistant should call the function with the default parameters, which are page=1 and page_size=20. However, if the user wants all, the assistant might need to call it again with page=2, but that's not specified. Since the user hasn't provided the page size, the assistant should proceed with the default. So the function call would be to get_api_tokens with the default parameters. But the user might need to be informed that more calls are needed. But according to the instructions, the assistant should make the function calls until the task is fulfilled. So the assistant should call the function once with the default parameters, and if there are more tokens, the system will handle it. Therefore, the correct function call is to use the 'get_api_tokens' function with the default parameters."}

The user is asking for a reminder, so set_alarm seems appropriate. The parameters for set_alarm include alarm_time, which can be in various formats. The user provided the date as \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", but that's probably a typo. The correct date should be \"2023-12-01\" (assuming tomorrow is the 1st of December). The time is 7:00 AM, which in 24-hour format is \"07:00\". The function allows for 'HH:MM' or 'HH:MM:SS' or AM/PM. Since the user specified AM, I should use \"07:00 AM\". \n\nWait, the alarm_time parameter's description says it can be in 'HH:MM' or 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM AM/PM'. So the format would be \"07:00 AM\". The purpose is optional, defaulting to 'reminder', but the user mentioned a meeting, so maybe set the purpose to 'meeting' for clarity.\n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm(alarm_time=\"2023-12-01 07:00 AM\", purpose=\"meeting\"). But wait, the date format in the example is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\". The user's date is \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which is likely a typo. The correct date should be \"2023-12-01\" (assuming tomorrow is the 1st).
