The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting on March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is hotel_booking. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The preferences are optional and default to all if not specified.\n\nThe user mentioned \"pet friendly,\" so that's a preference. The room type is single. The location is Manhattan, New York. The duration is 3 nights. The start date is March 10th, 2023. \n\nWait, the function's parameters include 'preferences' as an array with enum options. The user specified \"pet friendly,\" which is one of the enum values. So I should include that in the preferences array. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\nlocation: \"Manhattan, New York\"\nroom_type: \"single\"\nduration: 3\nstart_date: \"2023-03-10\"\npreferences: [\"pet_friendly\"]\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required ones are present. The preferences are optional but the user specified a preference, so including them is better. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be hotel_booking with those parameters."}
