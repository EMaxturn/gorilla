The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s, accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned straight-line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_displacement' which takes initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The required parameters are all provided here: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, defaulting to 2 decimals. The user didn't specify rounding, so I'll use the default.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters match. The function expects integers for initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The given values are all integers. So the function call should include those three parameters. No need to include rounding since it's optional and the default is already 2.\n\nSo the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. That should compute the displacement using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Let me double-check the parameters: yes, all required are present and correct. No other functions are needed here."}

The user provided all three: game title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. The region has a default, but since the user specified it, I should include that. So I need to call store_price with those parameters. There's no need to check if it's on sale first because the user specifically wants the price. So the function call should be store_price with the given parameters."}

The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I need to call this function with those parameters.\n\nI should make sure the parameters are integers. The user specified 7 and 10, which are integers. The function expects integers, so that's correct. No missing parameters here. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here. So the right choice is geometry_rectangle.calculate with width 7 and length 10."}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). The required parameters are distance and time. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, which is the default. So I can use this function with distance=20 and time=4.\n\nWait, the other function is calculate_acceleration, but that requires initial and final speed, which we don't have here. So the correct function here is calculate_speed_from_rest. The parameters are distance (integer) and time (integer). The user provided 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. So I should call that function with those values."}

Since they're the same gas, the final temperature should be a weighted average based on the quantities. The formula is probably (quantity1 * temp1 + quantity2 * temp2) divided by the total quantity. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_final_temperature' which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. All required parameters are provided here: 2, 300, 3, 400. So I can directly call that function with these values. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't needed here since the question doesn't involve mass or molar mass. No missing parameters either, everything's given.

Each die typically has 6 sides, but the function allows specifying sides_per_die. Wait, the user didn't mention the number of sides, but since they said \"dice,\" I can assume standard 6-sided dice. So sides_per_die should be 6. Let me make sure all required parameters are included. desired_sum is 7, sides_per_die is 6. The n_rolls is 2, which is optional but needed here.
