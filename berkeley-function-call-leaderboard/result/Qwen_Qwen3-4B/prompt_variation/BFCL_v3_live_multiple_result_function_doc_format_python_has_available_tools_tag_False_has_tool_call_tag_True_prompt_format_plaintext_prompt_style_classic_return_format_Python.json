The second one has loc, type, and time with a default for time. \n\nThe user provided all necessary parameters: loc is the address, type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. So, either function could work. But the first function (uber.ride) explicitly requires all three parameters, while the second (uber.ride2) has time with a default. Since the user specified 10 minutes, which is the default for ride2, but maybe the user's request is more accurately handled by ride1. Wait, but the description for ride2 says it's for weather, which doesn't make sense here. Wait, no, looking back: the second function's description says it's for finding the weather at the location, but that's a mistake because the parameters are similar to the first function. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the function descriptions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first function is for finding an Uber ride based on location, type, and time. The second function's description says it's for finding the weather at the location, but the parameters are loc, type, and time. That seems inconsistent. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement. But given that the user is asking for an Uber ride, the correct function to use is uber.ride. Because the second function's description doesn't make sense for an Uber ride. So, the user's request matches the first function's parameters.

The parameters needed are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user mentioned the keyword, so I'll use that. The result_format should be 'text' as requested. The language isn't specified, but the default is 'EN', but the user might want it in Korean since the query is in Korean. Wait, the function's default language is 'EN', but the user didn't specify.

Hmm, the user didn't mention language, so maybe stick with the default. But the user might expect Korean results.

The account number is given, along with the account name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. However, the transaction_overview parameter in the BankStatementOverView function expects a dictionary. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. Wait, the function's description says it includes a summary of transactions for the period. But the user also asked for a summary of transactions, so maybe the transaction_overview is a parameter that needs to be constructed.\n\nWait, looking at the function parameters again: transaction_overview is a dict summary of transactions, including totals and counts. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. However, the user might expect that the function can generate the summary based on the provided totals. But the function's parameters might require that the transaction_overview is provided. However, the user hasn't given individual transactions, only the total deposits and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_overview is a parameter that needs to be constructed from the given data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to create the transaction summary, and then the BankStatementOverView can use that. But the user is asking for an overview that includes the transaction summary. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview parameter is a dict. The user has provided starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. But the transaction_overview might need to include more details like the number of transactions, but the user hasn't provided that. However, the user might not have that data, so perhaps the function can be called with the given totals as part of the transaction overview.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used to generate the transaction summary, which would then be passed to the BankStatementOverView. But the user is asking for an overview that includes the transaction summary, so perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the right function here.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that they want a summary of transactions for the period. The transaction_summary.generate function is designed to generate such a summary. However, the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview parameter is a dict. So maybe the user needs to first generate the transaction summary using transaction_summary.generate, then pass that into the BankStatementOverView.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. The transaction_summary.generate function requires a list of transactions, but the user hasn't provided that. However, the user has provided total deposits and withdrawals, starting and ending balances. Maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be called with the given totals, but the function's parameters include transactions (a list of individual transactions), which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, perhaps the transaction_summary.generate isn't applicable here because the user hasn't given individual transactions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView can be called with the provided totals as part of the transaction_overview. The transaction_overview is a dictionary, so perhaps it can include the total deposits, total withdrawals, starting balance, ending balance, and the number of transactions. But the user hasn't provided the number of transactions. However, the user might not have that data, so maybe the function can be called with the available data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is constructed from the provided totals. But the function's parameters for transaction_overview are not clear. The description says it's a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts. So perhaps the transaction_overview should include the total deposits, total withdrawals, starting balance, ending balance, and the number of transactions. But the user hasn't provided the number of transactions. However, the user might not have that data, so maybe the function can be called with the available data, even if some parameters are missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the given account details and the transaction_overview constructed from the provided totals. So the parameters would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut the transaction_overview is supposed to be a summary of transactions, which might include more details. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe this is the best possible approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, including the transaction_overview constructed from the given totals."}

The parameters required are name (default 'localhost'), host, and api_key. The user provided the hostname, which is the 'host' parameter. The API key is given, so that's covered. The name isn't specified, so it will default to 'localhost', but maybe they want a different name. Wait, the user didn't mention a nickname, so the default is okay. \n\nWait, the hostname they provided is http://plga.ca. But the function's host parameter expects a hostname or IP address. Is http://plga.ca a valid host? Maybe, but sometimes hosts are just the domain without the protocol. But the function's documentation says host is the server's hostname or IP, like 'localhost' or '192.168.1.10'. So perhaps the user intended the host to be 'plga.ca' without the http://. But the user wrote http://plga.ca. Hmm. But the function's parameter example includes 'localhost' and '192.168.1.10', so maybe the user should provide just the hostname. However, the user's input is http://plga.ca. Should I use that as is? Or maybe it's a mistake. But since the user provided that, I should use it. \n\nSo the function call would be add_mtnards_server with host='http://plga.ca' and api_key='1234324'. The name parameter is optional and defaults to 'localhost', so unless the user specifies a different name, we can leave it as default. The user didn't mention a name, so that's okay. \n\nI think that's all. The required parameters are host and api_key, which are provided.

Alternatively, since the default is 'all', maybe specifying type='mtna' would be better to get only MTNA servers. Wait, the function's args say that if type is 'all' or omitted, all servers are listed. So to get MTNA servers, perhaps the type should be 'mtna'? But I need to check if the function expects a specific type. The function's docstring says \"the type of server to filter the list by.

The description says it retrieves the list of technologies Adriel was working on, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools. That sounds exactly like what the user needs.\n\nNow, checking the parameters for get_tech_stack. The required argument is employee_id. The user provided \"id Adriel\" in the question, so I should use \"Adriel\" as the employee_id. The other parameters are include_tools (default False) and as_of_date (defaults to current date). The user didn't specify any date, so the default is fine. Since they didn't mention tools specifically, the default for include_tools is probably okay, but maybe the function includes tools by default? Wait, the default for include_tools is False, so if the user wants tools, they need to set it to True. But the question just asks for the tech stack, which typically includes languages, frameworks, and tools. However, the function's default is to not include tools. Hmm, but the user might expect tools to be included. Wait, the function's description says \"including programming languages, frameworks, and tools\", but the parameter include_tools is a flag to determine if the list should include tools. So maybe the default is to not include them, but the function's description says it includes them. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the function's default is to include tools? Wait, looking back: the function's args are include_tools (default False) and as_of_date. The description says \"include tools in addition to languages and frameworks\". So if include_tools is False, it might only include languages and frameworks. But the user is asking for the tech stack, which usually includes all of them. So maybe the user expects tools to be included. But the function's default is False. So perhaps the user needs to set include_tools=True to get the tools. However, the user's question doesn't specify whether they want tools or not. But the function's default is False, so if we don't set it, it might not include tools. But the function's description says it includes them. Maybe the default is True? Wait, no, the parameter is include_tools with default False. So the function as written would not include tools by default. But the description says it includes them. That's conflicting. Maybe the function's description is incorrect, but I have to go with the parameters. So the user is asking for the tech stack, which probably includes tools. Therefore, I should set include_tools=True to ensure tools are included. But the user didn't specify that. However, the function's default is False, so maybe the user needs to set it. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is True. Wait, no, the parameter is include_tools (default=False). So the function will not include tools unless specified. But the user is asking for the tech stack, which includes tools. Therefore, the correct call would be to set include_tools=True. But the user didn't mention that. However, the function's description says that the tech stack includes tools, so maybe the default should be True. But according to the parameters, it's False. So perhaps the user needs to set include_tools=True. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is True, but the parameter says False. This is a bit confusing. But I have to follow the parameters as given. So the function's default is False. Therefore, to get the full tech stack, including tools, the user should set include_tools=True. But the user's question doesn't specify that. However, the function's description says that the tech stack includes tools, so maybe the user expects that. Therefore, I should include include_tools=True. But the user's question is \"What is the tech stack that employee (id Adriel) was working on\". So the answer should include all technologies, which would require include_tools=True. Therefore, the function call should be get_tech_stack with employee_id=\"Adriel\", include_tools=True. But the user didn't specify the date, so as_of_date is default. So the correct function call is get_tech_stack(employee_id=\"Adriel\", include_tools=True). But wait, the function's default for include_tools is False. So if the user doesn't specify, it's False. But the user is asking for the tech stack, which includes tools. Therefore, the assistant should set include_tools=True to ensure that tools are included. So the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id=\"Adriel\", include_tools=True).

Wait, the function's description says event_type is the category, so maybe the user can specify one type. But the user mentioned both concerts and plays. Hmm, maybe I should call the function twice, once for each event type. But the function might allow a list? Wait, looking back at the function definition: the args for Events_3_FindEvents have event_type as a string. So perhaps the user needs to specify one type at a time. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types, but the parameters are set as a single string. The user's question is about both concerts and plays, so maybe I should call the function twice, once for each event type. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the given function definition, it's a single string. So perhaps the user needs to make two separate calls.

Alternatively, maybe the function can take a list, but according to the given function definition, it's a string. So perhaps the user needs to make two separate calls.

Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if passed as a comma-separated string. But the function's parameters don't specify that. So I need to check the function's parameters again. The function's args for Events_3_FindEvents: event_type (str), city (str), date (str, default='any'). So the event_type is a single string.

Therefore, the assistant should check if the date can be inferred. But since the assistant can't do that, the answer would be that the date is missing. However, the user's question is in the context of the current turn, so maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the given information.

The user wants to find a bus itinerary from Fresno, CA to Los Angeles on March 10th, 2023. They mentioned they're traveling alone, so the number of passengers is 1.\n\nLooking at the available functions, Buses_3_FindBus seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. The user provided the cities and date, so I can plug those in. The category is optional and defaults to 'direct', which is probably a direct bus. Since they didn't specify a category, I'll use the default. The num_passengers is 1, which is within the allowed range of 1-5. \n\nI need to make sure the date is in the correct format. The user said March 10th, 2023. The function expects 'MM/DD/YYYY', so that would be 03/10/2023. \n\nSo the function call should be Buses_3_FindBus with from_city='Fresno, CA', to_city='Los Angeles, CA', departure_date='03/10/2023', num_passengers=1, and category='direct' (though category is optional, so maybe it's okay to omit it, but including it might be better to ensure it's direct). Wait, the default for category is 'direct', so even if we don't include it, it's okay. But the user didn't mention anything about the route category, so maybe just leave it as default. \n\nSo the final function call would be using Buses_3_FindBus with the provided parameters. I don't see any missing parameters here. The user didn't mention anything about luggage or time for the purchase, so that's for the BuyBusTicket function, which isn't needed here. So the correct tool call is to use FindBus with the given details."}

But the user didn't specify exact stars, so maybe just set it to a high value. Province_id for Bangkok is 1. District_name is Chatuchak. The available date is March 22, 2024. The start_available_date should be '2024-03-22 00:00:00' and end_available_date might be null since it's a single date.

The is_excellent parameter might be useful to get top providers. Let me include that as True. Also, check if the function requires all parameters to be provided.

The available functions are add_service_config, ApplicationSettingsApi.get_service_configs, and ApplicationSettingsApi.order_service_config. The task is to add a new service, so the add_service_config function is the right choice here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for add_service_config: service_name (str) and configurations (dict). The service_name is given as 'fdsa'. The configurations need to include timeout, retry count, endpoint URL, and authentication. \n\nThe configurations dictionary should map each parameter to its value. Timeout is 30 seconds, so 'timeout': 30. Retry count is 5, so 'retry_count': 5. The endpoint URL is 'https://api.fdsa-service.com'. Authentication is required, so maybe 'authentication_required': True. \n\nWait, the function's configurations argument is a dict of key-value pairs. The exact keys might depend on what the service expects. But the user specified those parameters, so I'll use those keys.

The user is asking for all API tokens, so maybe both functions could be relevant. But the get_api_tokens is for the user's account, and get_shareable_api_tokens is for custom dashboards. Since the user didn't mention dashboards, maybe just get_api_tokens is needed.\n\nThe get_api_tokens function requires user_id and include_expired. The user didn't specify if they want expired tokens, so the default is False. But the user is asking to \"remind\" them of the tokens, which might include all existing ones, both expired and not. However, the default is False, so maybe the function will return only the active ones. But the user might need all, so maybe set include_expired to True? Wait, but the user didn't specify that. However, the function's default is False, so if we don't include it, it'll exclude expired. But the user might not know if some are expired. Hmm, but the question is to remind them of all tokens, so maybe including expired ones would be better. But the user didn't mention that. However, the function's parameter has a default, so maybe the user wants all tokens, including expired. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the active ones. \n\nWait, the user is asking to \"remind me of them\", which could mean all tokens they have, regardless of expiration. But the function's default is to not include expired. So maybe the user needs to set include_expired=True to get all tokens. But the user didn't specify that. However, the function's parameter is optional, so maybe the assistant should call the function with include_expired=True to ensure all tokens are retrieved. But the user might not have provided that parameter. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the active ones. \n\nBut the user is asking to \"remind\" them of all tokens, so perhaps the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True.

However, the function's parameter is optional, so the assistant can choose to include it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to both their own tokens and shareable ones. But the get_shareable_api_tokens is for custom dashboards.

But the user didn't specify that, but the function's default is False. However, the user might need all tokens, so including expired ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is only referring to their own API tokens, not the shareable ones.

But the user didn't specify that, but the function's parameter is optional. So the assistant can choose to include it. \n\nTherefore, the function call would be: get_api_tokens(user_id=\"user123\", include_expired=True). \n\nAlternatively, if the user is not sure, maybe just call the function without include_expired, which would default to False. But the user might need all tokens. \n\nBut the user is asking to \"remind me of them\", which implies all tokens they have. So including expired ones would be better.

Wait, the function's docstring says alert_type is a string, but the user didn't specify it. Hmm, but the user said \"for an error rate threshold of 5%\", so I need to infer the alert_type as 'error_rate' or something similar. The function might expect that.

But the question says \"for an error rate threshold\", so the alert_type must be something related to error rate. The function's parameters require alert_type, so I have to include it. The user didn't specify, but the context implies it. So I'll have to assume the alert_type is 'error_rate' or similar. Alternatively, maybe the function uses a specific value, but since the user didn't specify, I have to make an educated guess. The function's parameters don't have a description for alert_type, so maybe it's up to the user to specify.

The user wants to wake up early for a meeting tomorrow, December 1, 2023, and set a reminder for 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's set_alarm and set_countdown. The user is asking for a reminder at a specific time, so set_alarm seems appropriate here. The set_alarm function can take a time in 24-hour format, including date if needed. The user specified the date as 2023-12-1, so I should include that in the alarm_time parameter. The time is 7:00 AM, which in 24-hour format is 07:00. Since the user mentioned \"7:00 AM\", I should convert that to '07:00' to fit the required format. The purpose is to wake up for a meeting, so the purpose parameter should be 'wake up' or something similar. The default purpose is 'reminder', but the user specified a meeting, so maybe 'meeting' would be better. Wait, the function's purpose parameter is optional, so I can set it to 'wake up' or 'meeting'. Let me check the function's parameters again. The purpose is a string, defaulting to 'reminder'. So, in this case, the user wants the alarm for a meeting, so setting purpose to 'meeting' makes sense. But the user says \"wake up early for a meeting\", so maybe the purpose should be 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function's example uses 'wake up' as a purpose. So I'll set the purpose to 'wake up' to match the example. \n\nWait, the alarm_time can be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format. The user provided the date as 2023-12-1, which is December 1st. But the format should be 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. So the date part is 2023-12-01, and the time is 07:00. So the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. But the user didn't specify seconds, so maybe it's okay to leave them as 00. Alternatively, the function allows 'HH:MM' without date, but since the user specified the date, including it would be better. So the alarm_time parameter would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. \n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00', purpose='wake up'). Alternatively, since the user mentioned the date as 'tomorro 2023-12-1', maybe there's a typo and it's supposed to be 'tomorrow' but the date is given as 2023-12-1. Wait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is likely a typo for 'tomorrow 2023-12-1'. But the date 2023-12-1 is December 1st, which is a day, but if today is December 2nd, then tomorrow would be December 3rd. However, the user might have made a mistake in the date. But regardless, the user provided the date as 2023-12-1, so I should use that. \n\nSo the correct function call is set_alarm with the alarm_time set to '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function's purpose parameter is optional, so maybe the default is okay, but the user specified the purpose as waking up for a meeting. So the purpose should be 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The example in the function's description uses 'wake up' as a purpose. So I'll go with that."}
