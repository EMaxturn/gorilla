The user wants to find records in the user table where age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'. I need to use the database.query function for this.\n\nFirst, check the parameters required for the function. The table name is required, which in this case is 'user'. The conditions parameter is an array. Each condition should be a key-value pair. The user specified two conditions: age > 25 and job = 'engineer'. \n\nSo, I need to structure the conditions array correctly. Each condition might be an object with the field, operator, and value. For example, for age, it's field 'age', operator '>', value 25. For job, field 'job', operator '=', value 'engineer'. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for conditions is an array, but the exact structure isn't specified here. The user's example might use a format where each condition is a string like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But sometimes, conditions are passed as objects. However, the function's parameter description says conditions is an array, but the type is array, and each element's type isn't specified. The user's example might use strings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the conditions are passed as an array of objects with field, operator, and value. But since the function's parameters don't specify the structure of each condition element, I need to make an assumption. However, looking back, the function's parameters for conditions is an array, but the example in the problem might use strings. For example, in some systems, conditions are written as strings like \"age > 25 AND job = 'engineer'\". But the function's parameters might expect an array of such strings. Alternatively, maybe each condition is a separate element in the array. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'\". So the conditions are combined with AND. If the function's conditions array expects each condition as a separate string, then the array would be [\"age > 25\", \"job = 'engineer'\"]. But if the function expects an array of objects, then each condition is an object. However, the function's parameter description doesn't specify the structure of the array elements. \n\nSince the function's parameters for conditions is an array, but the type isn't specified beyond being an array, perhaps the user expects that each condition is a string in the array. So, the conditions array would be [\"age > 25\", \"job = 'engineer'\"]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function expects an array of objects with field, operator, and value. But without more information, I have to go with the most straightforward approach. Given that the user's question uses a natural language condition, it's possible that the function expects the conditions to be passed as an array of strings, each representing a condition. \n\nTherefore, the parameters for the database.query function would be table: \"user\" and conditions: [\"age > 25\", \"job = 'engineer'\"]. \n\nI should structure the JSON accordingly. The function name is database.query, the table is \"user\", and the conditions array includes the two conditions as strings. That should do it."}

Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are company, start_date, and location. The status is optional with a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe user specified 'ongoing' lawsuits, which matches the default status. So I don't need to include the status parameter unless they wanted a different status. Since they mentioned 'ongoing', it's safe to use the default.\n\nThe company is Google. The start_date should be after January 1, 2021. The date format required is MM-DD-YYYY. So January 1, 2021 would be 01-01-2021. But the user says 'after' that date, so maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021? Wait, but the parameter is called start_date, and the description says \"Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So if they want lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, the start_date should be set to 01-02-2021. However, sometimes date ranges can be inclusive. But the user's exact wording is \"after January 1, 2021\", so maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021. However, the function might not have an end date parameter, so perhaps the start_date is the earliest date to search from. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for a date range with start and end, but looking at the parameters, the function only has start_date, not end_date. Wait, the parameters for the function are company, start_date, location, and status. There's no end_date parameter. So the function might be designed to search from start_date onwards. So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, setting the start_date to 01-01-2021 would include that date. But the user said \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021. However, the exact interpretation depends on how the function's backend handles the date. Since the user specified \"after January 1, 2021\", perhaps the start_date should be 01-02-2021. But the function's parameter description says \"Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\", so maybe the start_date is inclusive. If the user wants after January 1, maybe the start_date is 01-02-2021. However, without an end date, the function would return all lawsuits from that start_date onwards. But the user might want to include all dates after January 1, 2021, so setting start_date to 01-01-2021 would include that date and later. But the user said \"after\", which might mean excluding January 1. However, since the function doesn't have an end date, perhaps the best approach is to set the start_date to 01-01-2021 and assume that the system will handle \"after\" by using that date. Alternatively, maybe the function's start_date is the earliest date to include, so if the user wants after January 1, the start_date should be 01-02-2021. But without knowing the exact behavior, it's safer to use the date as specified by the user. The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so perhaps the start_date should be 01-02-2021. However, the function's parameter example might expect the start_date as the earliest date to search from. Let me check the parameter description again: \"Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed in the format of MM-DD-YYYY.\" So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, the start_date should be set to 01-02-2021. But maybe the function allows for a date range with start_date as the lower bound. So the correct start_date here is 01-01-2021 if the user wants including that date, but since they said \"after\", maybe 01-02-2021. However, the user might not be precise, and the function might not have an end date, so perhaps the best is to use the date as given, even if it's inclusive. Alternatively, the user might have intended \"after\" as \"on or after\", which would be 01-01-2021. This is a bit ambiguous, but given that the function's start_date is required, and the user's instruction is to file after January 1, 2021, I'll set the start_date to 01-01-2021. The location is California, which is the full state name. The status is ongoing, which is the default, so we can omit it. Therefore, the function call would be to lawsuit_search with company: Google, start_date: 01-01-2021, location: California."}

I'll go with the current month plus one, formatted as a string. Let's assume today's date is October 15, 2023, so next month would be November 2023. But since the exact date isn't specified, maybe just the month and year. Alternatively, maybe the function expects a date like \"2023-11-01\" to \"2023-11-30\". However, the parameter is a single string, not a range. The description says \"time frame to get the concert for,\" so perhaps a month can be represented as \"2023-11\" or \"November 2023\". I'll format the date as \"2023-11\" for next month. \n\nSo the parameters would be location: \"New York\", genre: \"pop\", date: \"2023-11\". Let me make sure all required parameters are included. Yes, all three are required. Alright, that should work."}

The user is asking about the music theory chord progression function. They provided the progression ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'] and want to identify the key signature.\n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters required for the function. The function requires the progression array, which they've given. The other parameters are optional: returnAllPossibleKeys and assumeMajor. The user didn't specify those, so the defaults will be used. AssumeMajor is true by default, so the function will look for a major key. \n\nThe chord progression given is I, V, vi, IV. Let me think about common progressions. In a major key, the vi chord is minor. For example, in C major, the vi chord is Am. But the progression here includes IV, which is major. Wait, in C major, IV is F major. So the progression I (C), V (G), vi (Am), IV (F). That's a common progression, like in \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" or other songs. The key here would be C major. \n\nBut the function's job is to determine that. Since the user didn't specify returnAllPossibleKeys, it will return the first valid key. Assuming major, the function should return C major. But I need to make sure that the function is called correctly. The parameters are correctly provided, so the tool call is valid. No missing parameters. So the correct function call is to use music.theory.chordProgression with the given progression and default parameters."}
