The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the user is replacing the food item from whatever it was before with a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The original food item isn't specified, but the user is changing it to Caesar salad. So I'll set foodItem to \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients to \"anchovies\", and maybe set specialInstructions if needed. Since they didn't mention any other changes, maybe just removeIngredients is enough.\n\nThen for the drink, the user wants drink_id 123, size large, temperature hot, sweetness_level regular, milk_type almond. The ChaDri.change_drink function has parameters drink_id, new_preferences which includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The default for size is medium, so I need to set it to large. Temperature is hot, sweetness regular, milk almond. The default for milk_type is regular, so I need to change that to almond. The user didn't mention any special instructions, so that's empty.\n\nSo I need to call ChaFod with the food item and remove ingredients, and ChaDri.change_drink with the drink ID and the updated preferences. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. For the food, newIngredients is optional, but the user wants to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". The specialInstructions might not be needed here. For the drink, the new_preferences should have all the specified parameters."}

The user is asking for the current weather in Guangzhou and Beijing using metric units. First, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_current_weather, which requires a location and an optional unit.\n\nThe parameters for get_current_weather are location and unit. The location needs to be in a format like 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So for Guangzhou, it's 'Guangzhou, CN' and Beijing is 'Beijing, CN'. The unit is metric, which is the default, but the user specified it, so I should include it explicitly.\n\nWait, the function's parameters have a default for unit as 'metric', so even if not provided, it would use metric. But the user asked for metric, so maybe include it to be safe. But the default is already metric, so maybe it's optional. However, the user explicitly mentioned metric, so including it might be better.\n\nSo I need to call get_current_weather twice, once for each city. Each call will have the location parameter set to the respective city name with CN, and the unit as metric. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The location should be a string, and the unit is a string with 'metric' or 'imperial'.

The parameters required are location, category, and language. The user specified Paris, France, so the location is \"Paris, France\". The category for the first request is general news, but the user mentioned \"in English\" which is the default, so maybe the category can be left as default. Wait, the default category is 'General', but the user didn't specify a category for Paris, just wants the latest news. So for Paris, the category would be 'General' unless specified otherwise. \n\nThen, for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology. The location here is \"Letterkenny, Ireland\". The category is 'Technology' as specified, and the language is 'en' as requested. \n\nSo I need to call get_news_report twice.

The user has given a series of steps to perform using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions I need to use.\n\nFirst step: clone the repo. The user provided the URL git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and optionally destination, recursive, and depth. Since the destination is not specified, the default is '.' (current directory). So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The directory here is the cloned repo's directory, which is the current working directory. So I'll use the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name. Again, the directory is the cloned repo's path. The parameters include image_name, which defaults to 'latest', and other options like replicas, port, service_type. Since the user didn't specify these, I'll use defaults unless told otherwise. But the user might expect default values, so I'll proceed with the defaults.\n\nStep 3: add all changed files to git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory is the cloned repo. The commit message defaults to 'Update changes', branch to 'main', and force_push to False. So I'll call this function with the directory_name as the cloned repo path.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is the same as pushing changes. So the push function is correct here.\n\nNow, check if all parameters are covered. For clone_repo, repo_url is provided. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is the cloned repo's path. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same. For push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is same. The commit message and branch are defaults, which is okay.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the cloned repo path.\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name as cloned repo path.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as cloned repo path.\n\nI need to make sure that the functions are called in the correct order and parameters are correctly set. Also, check if any parameters are missing. For example, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file has defaults for some parameters, so they can be omitted unless specified. The user didn't mention any specific values for those, so using defaults is acceptable."}

The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so I need to find classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters required are 'search_string' and 'include_subdirectories'. The search string should be 'CellResult' and include subdirectories as true.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters needed are 'class_name' and 'method_name'. For 'setCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method is 'setCellValue'. Similarly, for 'getCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method is 'getCellValue'. The 'include_private' parameter is set to false by default, so it's okay.\n\nI need to make sure that the functions are called correctly. The first function call is to 'get_relevant_classes' with the search string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true. Then, two separate calls to 'get_signature' for each method.
