Let me translate it:\n\n- \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\" means \"Living room, Air conditioner, Execute\" or \"Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\"\n\n- \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\" means \"Bedroom, Air purifier, Stop it\" or \"Turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\"\n\nSo, the user wants to control two appliances: turn on the air conditioner in the living room and turn off the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, the one that matches is: ControlAppliance.execute\n\nThis function is for controlling home appliances. Its description says:\n\n- The command must be in Korean.\n\n- It consists of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\n\n- Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- Another example: '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine.\n\nThe user has two separate commands in one sentence. I need to handle both.\n\nThe function call format is for one command at a time, as per the args: command (str)\n\nSo, I should make separate function calls for each command.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can include multiple function calls in one response, as the format allows: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor the first part: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nThis directly matches the example. So, I can call ControlAppliance.execute with command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nFor the second part: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nThis would be command='\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nIn the user's message, it's \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\", which is similar, but I need to format it exactly as per the function's requirement. The function expects the command string without the extra \"\ud574\uc918\" (please do it for me).\n\nSo, I'll use '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nTherefore, I need to make two function calls:\n\n1. ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589')\n\n2. ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0')\n\nMy response should only be the <TOOLCALL> section with these calls.\n\nFormat: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, something like: <TOOLCALL>[ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'), ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAre there any other functions needed?

The example given is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' which means 'living room, air conditioner, execute' or turn on.\n\n  So, for \"turn on the air conditioner in the living room\", I need to translate that to: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'.\n\n- For information on the Imjin War: This seems like a historical topic, but the user wants \"up-to-date information\". The Imjin War is from the 16th century, so it's not something that changes frequently. However, the function \"HNA_WQA.search\" is for web searches on topics that change frequently, like current events. There's also \"HNA_NEWS.search\" for news.\n\n  The description for HNA_WQA.search says it's for topics that change frequently, but I could use it anyway. HNA_NEWS.search is for recent events and news, which might not fit perfectly for historical events, but if there are recent discussions or anniversaries, it could work.

The instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

For the Imjin War: HNA_WQA.search(keyword='Imjin War')\n\n   - I should specify language as 'EN' by default, but maybe confirm if needed. The user didn't specify, so default is fine.\n\nThe function HNA_WQA.search has defaults for result_format, language, and max_results, so I can just provide the keyword.\n\nFinally, structure the response: Only include the <TOOLCALL> section with all the function calls inside it, separated by commas if multiple.\n\nFormat: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for multiple: <TOOLCALL>[func1(params), func2(params), func3(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nMake sure there are no other texts in the response."}

Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to map these steps to the available functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This matches step 1. It takes repo_url, and optionally destination, recursive, depth.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It takes directory_name.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It takes directory_name.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It takes directory_name, and other optional params.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 3 and 4. It handles adding, committing, and pushing changes. It takes directory_name, commit_message, etc.\n\nThe order matters. I have to do this in sequence because each step depends on the previous one.\n\nIn this system, I need to output function calls one at a time in the <TOOLCALL> section.

For example, I need to clone the repo first before analyzing it.\n\nIn this setup, the system will execute the functions in sequence as I specify them.\n\nTo be precise, I should output the functions in the order they need to be called.\n\nLet me outline the sequence:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with the given URL.\n\n2. After cloning, call analyse_repo_contents on the cloned directory.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, call create_a_docker_file.\n\n4. Then, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n5. Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github to add, commit, and push.\n\nThe analysis function doesn't return anything directly to me; it's just a tool call. So, in my response, I have to assume that the analysis will happen, and then I can proceed to call the creation functions.\n\nThe user says \"based on the analysis\", but in the tools, create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file don't take analysis results as input. They just take directory_name.\n\nLooking at the functions:\n\n- create_a_docker_file only needs directory_name.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name and other params, but it doesn't explicitly say it uses analysis.\n\nIn the human's request: \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\" and \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis.\"\n\nHowever, the functions don't have parameters for analysis results. I have to call them as is, assuming the function will handle it internally, but from the description, it doesn't say that.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file: \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory to enable containerization of the application.\"\n\nIt doesn't mention using analysis, but perhaps it's implied.\n\nSimilarly for Kubernetes.\n\nI think I just need to call them after analysis.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 3.\n\nNow, about parameters:\n\n- For clone_repo: repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n  I'll use default for others.\n\n- For analyse_repo_contents: directory_name \u2013 after cloning, if cloned to default '.', it might be the repo name. The repo URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, so probably clones to a directory named 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n  I need to specify directory_name. Let's assume it's 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n- For create_a_docker_file: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n- For create_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome', and other defaults.\n\n- For push_git_changes_to_github: directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message, etc.\n\nThe function descriptions say for directory_name: \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nFor clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it clones to '.', which is the current directory, and the repo will be in a subdir like 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo, probably directory_name should be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nI need to make sure.\n\nIn my response, I should call all these in sequence in one <TOOLCALL>.\n\nThe format allows multiple: [func1, func2, ...]\n\nSo, I'll list them in order.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // Assuming the cloned dir is 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // With defaults\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update with Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML')  // I can set a message\n\nThe user didn't specify a commit message, so I'll use the default or something appropriate.\n\nIn the function, default is 'Update changes', so that's fine.\n\nOne potential issue: Is 'nodejs-welcome' the correct directory name? From the repo URL, yes, Git typically uses the last part.\n\nI think that's standard.\n\nAlright, let's prepare the response."}

This sounds like finding the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 5.\n\nI have two functions available:\n\n- math_gcd: This takes two non-negative integers and calculates their GCD. Perfect for the first part.\n\n- estimate_derivative: This estimates the derivative of a function at a point. I can use this for the second part.\n\nFor the first part: math_gcd requires two arguments, a and b, which are non-negative integers. The user provided 36 and 48, both positive integers, so I can call this directly. I need to ensure a is the larger one, as per the description: \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\". 48 is larger than 36, so I should set a=48 and b=36.\n\nThe function description says: \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\". So, yes, I need to pass the larger one as a. 48 > 36, so a=48, b=36.\n\nFor the second part: estimate_derivative requires:\n\n- function: A callable object, like a function.\n\n- x: The point, which is 5.\n\n- dx: Optional, default 0.0001.\n\n- method: Optional, default 'central'.\n\nThe user specified f(x) = x^2. In this setup, I need to provide a callable function. However, in my response, I have to make a function call, but I don't have a way to define f(x) = x^2 within the tool call. The function expects \"function (any): The mathematical function... provided as a callable object.\"\n\nThis is a problem. In this simulated environment, I can't actually pass a Python function like lambda x: x**2 directly in the tool call string.

For estimate_derivative, the 'function' parameter needs to be a callable, but in this text-based response, I have to represent it somehow.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that the system can handle it, or maybe I should just pass it as a string or something. But the function definition says \"function (any): The mathematical function... provided as a callable object.\"\n\nThis might be an issue. In practice, for this exercise, I think I need to pretend that I can pass it. Maybe use a string representation.\n\nThe system prompt doesn't specify how to handle functions as parameters.

The user wants to flip horizontally, so this fits.\n\n- rotateImageAction: This rotates the image clockwise by a specified degree. The user wants to turn it by 20 degrees, which I assume means rotate by 20 degrees.\n\nSo, I need to call both functions: one for rotation and one for flipping.\n\nThe user didn't specify any image to work on. For rotateImageAction, it requires 'degrees', 'image_format', and 'keep_original'. It doesn't explicitly require an image path or data, but in the context, we might assume there's an image in context. However, looking at other functions like removeBackgroundAction, it requires 'image_path'. rotateImageAction doesn't list an image as a parameter, which is odd. Let me double-check:\n\nFrom the function descriptions:\n\n- rotateImageAction: Args: degrees (int), image_format (str, default='JPEG'), keep_original (bool, default=True). No explicit image input.\n\n- flipImageAction: No args listed except flip_direction.\n\nThis is incomplete because these functions probably need an image to operate on, but it's not specified in the args. For example, getRecommendationsAction requires 'image_data' as a Base64 string.\n\nThe user hasn't provided any image data or path. So, I need to point out if the question lacks required parameters.\n\nFor rotateImageAction, it needs 'degrees', which is 20.\n\nFor flipImageAction, it needs 'flip_direction', which is 'horizontal'.\n\nBut neither function specifies an input image. This might be an oversight, but based on what's given, I have to work with it.\n\nIn the system prompt: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor rotateImageAction, the required parameter is 'degrees', which we have.\n\nFor flipImageAction, 'flip_direction' is required.\n\nHowever, intuitively, these functions need an image, but since it's not in the args, maybe I can proceed.\n\nPerhaps the system assumes an image is already in context.\n\nTo be safe, I should check if all required params are present.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIn my response, I MUST only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section, or if I can't, I suppose I don't output anything, but the prompt says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nThe exact instruction: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]</TOOLCALL>. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nIf I need to point something out, how do I do that? The prompt doesn't specify. It says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But then instructs to only return function calls.\n\nPerhaps I should only output <TOOLCALL> if I can make a call, otherwise, don't output anything. But that might not be right.\n\nRe-reading: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI think I should make the calls if possible.\n\nFor rotateImageAction, I can provide 'degrees=20'. The other params have defaults.\n\nFor flipImageAction, 'flip_direction='horizontal''.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that.\n\nThe user wants to do both: rotate and flip. I need to call both functions.\n\nThe order might matter, but since it's not specified, I'll just call them as is.\n\nIn the <TOOLCALL>, I can call multiple functions in one go, as per the format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, my response should be: <TOOLCALL>[rotateImageAction(degrees=20), flipImageAction(flip_direction='horizontal')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor rotateImageAction, is 20 degrees valid? Yes, between 0 and 360.\n\nFor flipImageAction, 'horizontal' is valid.\n\nI think that's it."}

It requires:\n\n- stylist_name: 'Elegant Styles'\n\n- appointment_time: '15:00' (which is in 24-hour format)\n\n- appointment_date: '2023-05-10'\n\nAll parameters are provided, so I can call this function.\n\nI need to make function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section, in the exact format specified.\n\nSince there are two actions, I should include both function calls in one <TOOLCALL> section, separated as per the format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)].\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I can list them inside the brackets.\n\nI should try to complete the tasks in the current turn, so I'll call both functions now.\n\nAfter these calls, I believe I've fulfilled the user's request, so no more functions needed.\n\nResponse structure: Only return the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else.\n\nFinal function calls:\n\n1. Services_1_FindProvider(city='Sunnyvale, CA', is_unisex='dontcare')\n\n2. Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name='Elegant Styles', appointment_time='15:00', appointment_date='2023-05-10')\n\nOrder might not matter, but I'll list them in the order of the user's request."}

Use short form for the state.\n\n        unit (str, default='fahrenheit'): The unit of measurement for temperature values.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\nThis function can be used. It takes a location and an optional unit parameter, which defaults to 'fahrenheit'. Since the user specified \"in fahr\", I can use that.\n\nThe user wants weather for two locations: Boston, MA and San Francisco, CA.\n\nI need to make function calls for each. The instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

So, I need to fetch mandates for these specific users.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions:\n\n1. **user.mandates**:\n   - Args: name (str) - The full name of the partner's client.\n   - status (str, default='active') - The status of the mandates.\n\n   This function is for fetching mandates for a specific user by their name.\n\n2. **partner.mandates**:\n   - Args: status (str, default='all') - The status of the mandates.\n   - This fetches mandates for the partner, not for specific users. It doesn't take a user name as an argument.\n\nThe user wants mandates for specific users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\". The **user.mandates** function is perfect for that because it allows specifying the user's name.\n\nThe user specified statuses: \"pending and active\". But in **user.mandates**, the status defaults to 'active', and I can specify it. However, I need to fetch both 'pending' and 'active'. This function might only fetch for one status at a time, based on what I provide.\n\nThe function description: \"status (str, default='active')\". It seems like I can pass a single status string. It doesn't support multiple statuses in one call.\n\nSo, for each user, I might need to make separate calls for 'pending' and 'active' statuses.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active\", so I need to get both.\n\nAlso, there are two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\". So, for each user, I need to fetch both statuses.\n\nThat could mean up to 4 calls: \n- user.mandates for parath with status='pending'\n- user.mandates for parath with status='active'\n- user.mandates for bhanu with status='pending'\n- user.mandates for bhanu with status='active'\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

The **partner.mandates** doesn't specify users, so it's not useful here.\n\nFor **user.mandates**, if I don't specify status, it defaults to 'active'. But I need both.\n\nI have to make separate calls.\n\nThe function might not support fetching multiple statuses at once, so I'll proceed with multiple calls.\n\nPlan:\n- Call user.mandates for name='parath' and status='pending'\n- Call user.mandates for name='parath' and status='active'\n- Call user.mandates for name='bhanu' and status='pending'\n- Call user.mandates for name='bhanu' and status='active'\n\nI should output all these in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe exact format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(...), ...]</TOOLCALL>\n\nYes.\n\nOne potential issue: Are \"parath\" and \"bhanu\" full names? The function expects \"The full name of the partner's client\", so I'll assume that's what they are.\n\nIf not, that's on the user, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nAlright, let's write it out."}
