There's get_sculpture_details which takes a museum location and a sculpture ID. The get_artwork_price function requires a museum location, sculpture material, and size. \n\nThe user provided both sculptures' locations but didn't specify their IDs. So, I can't use get_sculpture_details for both unless I assume IDs. But the problem is, the user didn't give IDs. Maybe the functions can't be used without those parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the functions can be used with the locations but not the IDs. Wait, the get_sculpture_details function's parameters are museum_location and sculpture_id. The user mentioned the locations but not the IDs. So, perhaps I can't call get_sculpture_details for both sculptures since I don't have the IDs. \n\nThen, the get_artwork_price function requires the material and size. The user provided the material (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 ft and 6x3 ft), but the museum locations are given. So maybe I can use get_artwork_price for both sculptures. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided the IDs. So, maybe I need to make two function calls: one for each sculpture, using their respective locations and materials. However, the get_artwork_price function's parameters require the material and size, which the user provided. \n\nWait, the user's question is about the average price. So, I need to find the prices for each sculpture and then average them. But how to get the prices? The get_artwork_price function can retrieve the price based on size and material. \n\nSo, the steps would be: call get_artwork_price for the marble statue in Philadelphia, using material \"marble\" and size [4,4]. Then call get_artwork_price for the bronze statue in New York, using material \"bronze\" and size [6,3]. Then average the two prices. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the actual prices, so I can't compute the average without those values. However, the functions can be called as per the parameters given. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to make two function calls with the provided parameters.

The user has three parts to their question, each requiring a function call. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst part: Calculate the total energy produced from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The glucose conversion is 2800 kJ/mol, and the efficiency is 10%. So, I need to use the biological.calc_energy function. The parameters here are mols=5 and substance='C6H12O6'. The default for efficiency is 10%, so that's already covered, but maybe I should include it explicitly just to be safe.\n\nSecond part: Calculate biomass given energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step is the total energy, which I need to get from the first function. Then multiply by the efficiency (10% or 0.1). So, after getting the energy, multiply by 0.1 to get biomass.\n\nThird part: Calculate work done by the machine. The work is energy multiplied by distance. The energy from the first step is the total energy, and distance is 2 meters. So, use the physical.calc_work function with energy and distance.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned the conversion efficiency is 10% for the first part. So, the first function's efficiency is 0.1. The second function's parameters are mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The third function uses energy and distance.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly. Let me check the parameters again. For the first function, energy is 5 moles of glucose, substance is C6H12O6. The second function's parameters would be the energy from the first step (which is 5 * 2800 * 0.1?), but maybe the first function already gives the energy. Wait, the first function's energy is calculated with the given mols and substance. Then the biomass is energy * efficiency. The third function uses energy from the first step and distance.\n\nSo, the three function calls would be:\n\n1. biological.calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6')\n2. biological.calc_biomass(energy=energy_result, efficiency=0.1)\n3. physical.calc_work(energy=energy_result, distance=2)\n\nYes, that makes sense.

So for the first option, P is 5000, r is 0.04, t is 5. So I should call calc_Simple_Interest with these values.\n\nNext, the compound interest. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Here, n is 1 since it's compounded annually. So for the second option, P is 5000, r is 0.035, t is 5, n is 1.

The probability function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52 cards, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. So, calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, check if the parameters are strings. The size is a string, medium and dominant color as strings. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years as an integer, model as a string. For the poker, total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes are integers, round_to is an integer. All parameters are provided, so the function calls should be valid."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The house has an area of 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. So I need to use the predict_house_price function. The parameters required are area, rooms, year, and location. All these are provided, so I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the default state is California, but the user specified San Francisco, which is a county, maybe the state is California. Wait, the function's parameters have state as a default, but the county is specified. So I should include county as San Francisco and state as California. But the function's parameters might expect the county as a parameter. Let me check the function definition again. The lawsuit_search function's args are entity (str), county (str), state (str, default California). So the user provided county as San Francisco, so I can call the function with county set to San Francisco and state as California.\n\nThird, the probability of winning the lottery. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user provided total outcomes as 1000 and favorable as 5, and wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places. So I need to call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"the probability of winning the lottery\" and the parameters are total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So all three functions need to be called. Let me make sure each function is called correctly. The parameters for each function are correctly specified. So the final answer should include all three function calls."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of Apple Inc.'s lawsuits in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: get_collectables_in_season. The game is Animal Crossing, season is Summer, and item_type should be 'fish'. So that's one function call.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The function game_score.highest requires game, platform, and region. So game is Fortnite, platform is Playstation, region Asia. That's another call.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The function lawsuit_details.find needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user specified Apple Inc. and 2018, but case_type isn't mentioned. Maybe default to all. So call lawsuit_details.find with company_name 'Apple Inc.', year 2018, case_type 'all'.\n\nLastly, binomial probability. The function calculate_binomial_probability needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. So plug those values in.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters. Yes, all are covered. No missing parameters. So each function call should be made in order."}
