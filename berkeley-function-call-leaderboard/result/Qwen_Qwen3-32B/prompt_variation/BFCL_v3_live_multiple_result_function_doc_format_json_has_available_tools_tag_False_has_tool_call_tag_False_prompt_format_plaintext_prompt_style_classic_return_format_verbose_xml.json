The user is asking for an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', which is one of the allowed enums (plus, comfort, black). The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So all required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2. The parameters required are loc and type. The loc here needs to be in the format 'City, State', but the user provided a full street address. Also, uber.ride2 has a default value for time (10 minutes), but the user's input matches exactly. However, since the user's loc includes the street address, using uber.ride2 might not be appropriate because it expects just the city and state. \n\nSo, the correct function should be uber.ride because it accepts the full address. The parameters are all met: loc is the full address, type is 'plus', and time is 10. \n\nWait, the user wrote 'Plus' with a capital P, but the enum options are lowercase. But in the function parameters, the enum is listed as ['plus', 'comfort', 'black'], so the input should be lowercase. However, the user's input is 'Plus', which might be a typo. The function expects the exact enum value, so I should use 'plus' in the function call. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is uber.ride with loc='2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type='plus', time=10."}

The parameters needed are keyword, result_format, and max_results. The keyword is \"\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780\", result_format is text, and max_results is 10. The language isn't specified, but the default is EN. However, since the keyword is in Korean, maybe the user prefers results in Korean. But the function's language parameter options are EN, ES, FR, DE. There's no Korean option. The default is EN, but the user might want Korean results. Hmm, but the function doesn't support Korean language. So the search might still return relevant info in English or other languages. I'll proceed with the given parameters, using the keyword in Korean and result_format as text, max_results 10. The language parameter can't be set to Korean, but maybe the search engine can handle the Korean keyword regardless. So the function call should be HNA_WQA.search with keyword \"\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780\", result_format \"text\", max_results 10. The language remains default EN, but maybe the search will still find relevant Korean content. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with English results.

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include http_request, which can make an HTTP request. Maybe I can search online using that. But wait, the user might not have provided any API or specific URL to query. Using http_request without knowing the right endpoint might not work. Also, there's archival_memory_search, which does a semantic search on archival memory. But if I don't have that information stored, it won't help. Recall_memory_search checks conversation history, but the user hasn't mentioned anything about Shishir Patil before, so that's probably not useful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to know public figures. But Shishir Patil could be a common name; there might be multiple people with that name. Without more context, it's risky to assume. The functions don't include a way to access external databases or public information directly. So, I can't retrieve that data. \n\nSince I can't find the birthday through the provided functions, I should inform the user that I don't have that information. But the user also wants to send a congratulation message. If I can't get the birthday, I can't schedule the message. The send_message function requires a message and recipient. The user hasn't provided the recipient's details, like email or phone number. Even if I had the birthday, the recipient parameter is missing. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to tell the user I can't find Shishir Patil's birthday and that I need the recipient's contact information to send the message. But according to the instructions, I should only return function calls. Since none of the functions can retrieve the birthday or send the message without parameters, I should point out that the required parameters are missing. \n\nWait, the user might have intended to use the send_message function once the birthday is known. But since I can't find the birthday, I can't proceed. Also, the recipient isn't specified. So, the answer should state that the necessary parameters (birthday and recipient) are missing, and the functions available can't retrieve them. Therefore, no function can be called here."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for a specific period. They provided details like the account number, name, start and end dates, balances, deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, the account number, the account type is checking, the full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. For the transaction_overview, they need total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned $7,132.76 in deposits and $5,927.40 in withdrawals. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So that fits into the transaction_overview dict.\n\nThen, the user also wants a transaction summary. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just the totals. So maybe we can't use that function unless we have the list of transactions. However, the user might expect a summary even without individual transactions. But the function requires the transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe we can't generate that summary. Alternatively, maybe the Alltransactions function can retrieve the transactions for the period. Let me check Alltransactions parameters: it needs statement_period and include_pending. The statement period here is October 2019, so '2019-10'. If we call Alltransactions with that, we might get the list of transactions. Then, use that list in the transaction_summary.generate function.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the assistant needs to first retrieve them. However, in the current setup, the user is asking to provide the overview and summary based on the given data. Since the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, maybe the transaction_summary can be generated without individual transactions? But the function requires the transactions array. Hmm. The user might not have the transactions, so perhaps the assistant can't generate the summary. But the user is asking to include a summary, so maybe the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019, then use that data in the transaction_summary.generate function.\n\nWait, but the user is providing the total deposits and withdrawals, so maybe the transaction_summary can be generated with that info even without individual transactions. But the function parameters require the transactions array. So without that, the function can't be called. Therefore, the assistant needs to first retrieve the transactions using Alltransactions. However, the user hasn't provided the include_pending flag. The default is False, so maybe we can assume that. So first, call Alltransactions with statement_period '2019-10' and include_pending=False. Then, use the returned transactions in the transaction_summary.generate function. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't do that in this step. Therefore, maybe the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then proceed. However, in the current turn, the user is asking to provide the overview and summary. Since the user provided the necessary data for BankStatementOverView, that can be called first. For the transaction summary, if the transactions are not available, maybe the assistant can't generate it. But the user is asking to include it, so perhaps the assistant should proceed to call the transaction_summary.generate function with the available data, even if the transactions array is missing. But the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that the transactions are needed, but since the user is asking to include the summary, maybe the assistant should first retrieve the transactions via Alltransactions.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters.\n2. Call Alltransactions to get the transactions for October 2019.\n3. Then, call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions, along with the other parameters provided by the user.\n\nBut in the current turn, the user is asking for both the overview and the summary. Since the assistant can only make function calls, it needs to make the necessary calls in sequence. However, the assistant can't execute functions in sequence in one turn. Each turn is a single function call. Wait, the user is asking for both in one question. The assistant needs to make multiple function calls if needed. But according to the instructions, the assistant should make one or more function calls in the current turn. Wait, the instructions say: \"You should only return the function calls in your response. [...] Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nSo in this case, the assistant can make multiple function calls in one turn. So first, call BankStatementOverView, then Alltransactions, then transaction_summary.generate. But the transaction_summary requires the transactions array, which comes from Alltransactions. However, since the assistant can't execute the functions, it can only make the calls. So the assistant would need to first call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then use that data in the transaction_summary. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant has to make the call to Alltransactions first. Then, in the next turn, the system would process that and provide the transactions, allowing the assistant to call transaction_summary.generate.\n\nBut in the current turn, the user is asking for both the overview and the summary. So the assistant should first call BankStatementOverView, then Alltransactions, and then transaction_summary.generate. However, the transaction_summary requires the transactions array, which is not available yet. Therefore, the assistant can make the calls to BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions in this turn. Then, in the next turn, after Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant can call transaction_summary.generate.\n\nBut the user's question is a single request. The assistant needs to handle it in the current turn. Since the user provided the necessary data for BankStatementOverView, that can be called. For the transaction summary, the assistant needs to call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then use that data in transaction_summary.generate. However, in the current turn, the assistant can only make the initial calls. So the assistant would call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions. Then, in the next turn, after Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant can proceed to generate the summary.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should make all necessary function calls in the current turn. Wait, the user is asking for both the overview and the summary. The assistant can make multiple function calls in one turn. So the assistant can call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions in this turn. Then, once Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant can call transaction_summary.generate in the next turn.\n\nSo in this case, the first step is to call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. Then, call Alltransactions to get the transactions for the period. The parameters for Alltransactions are statement_period '2019-10' and include_pending=False (default). Then, once the transactions are retrieved, the assistant can call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions, along with the other parameters like starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and the customer's name. However, the user hasn't provided the customer's first and last name. The account is under SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, but that's the full_name parameter for BankStatementOverView. For the transaction_summary.generate, the user needs to provide firstname and lastname. Since the user hasn't provided these, the assistant might need to use collect_customer_names to get them. But the user hasn't mentioned the customer's name, so maybe the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, the user might have provided the full_name as SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which is the company name. So perhaps the firstname and lastname are not applicable, but the function requires them. Wait, the transaction_summary.generate function requires firstname and lastname. The user hasn't provided these, so the assistant can't call that function without them. Therefore, the assistant might need to call collect_customer_names to get the customer's name. But the user hasn't provided any customer name details. The account is under a company name, so maybe the customer's name is not required. However, the function requires firstname and lastname. This is a problem. The user hasn't provided the customer's name, so the assistant can't fulfill that part. Therefore, the assistant should call collect_customer_names to get the customer's name, but since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the company name is used instead, but the function parameters require firstname and lastname. This is a missing parameter. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the customer's name is missing. However, the user's question is about a business account under the company name, so perhaps the customer's name is not applicable. But the function requires it. This is a conflict. Therefore, the assistant might need to proceed without it, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't call transaction_summary.generate without the customer's name. So the assistant needs to inform the user that the customer's name is missing. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return function calls. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Wait, the instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" So in this case, the transaction_summary.generate requires firstname and lastname, which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, the assistant should point out that those parameters are missing. However, the user is asking to include a summary, so the assistant needs to handle that. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call BankStatementOverView, then Alltransactions, and then when trying to call transaction_summary.generate, realize that firstname and lastname are missing. Therefore, the assistant should call collect_customer_names to get the customer's name. But the user hasn't provided any customer name details. The account is under SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which is the company name. So perhaps the customer's name is not applicable, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed and must point out the missing parameters. However, the user might have intended that the company name is used, but the function requires firstname and lastname. Therefore, the assistant should call collect_customer_names with the company_name parameter set to SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, but the user hasn't provided the customer's first and last name. Therefore, the assistant can't fill in those parameters. This is a problem. \n\nGiven all this, the assistant should first call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. Then, call Alltransactions to get the transactions. Then, when trying to call transaction_summary.generate, realize that firstname and lastname are missing. Therefore, the assistant should call collect_customer_names to get the customer's name. However, the user hasn't provided the customer's name, so the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the customer's name is missing. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return function calls. Therefore, the assistant should make the calls to BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions, and then when trying to call transaction_summary.generate, realize that firstname and lastname are missing. Therefore, the assistant should call collect_customer_names. But the user hasn't provided any customer name details. Therefore, the assistant can't fill in the parameters for collect_customer_names. The function requires firstname and lastname, but the user hasn't provided them. Therefore, the assistant can't call collect_customer_names. Therefore, the assistant must point out that the parameters are missing. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, in this case, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions, and then indicate that the transaction_summary.generate requires firstname and lastname which are missing. But according to the instructions, the assistant should only return function calls. Therefore, the assistant can only make the calls that are possible. So the assistant will call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions. Then, in the next turn, after Alltransactions returns the transactions, the assistant would need to call transaction_summary.generate, but since firstname and lastname are missing, the assistant can't. Therefore, the assistant must point out that the parameters are missing. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should only return function calls. Therefore, the assistant can only make the calls that are possible. So the answer is to call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions."}

So here, a would be 3 and b 10. Using multiply(3,10) should give 30. Then, the user is asking for the total they have now. Since they started with zero (assuming they didn't have any money before), adding the 30 euros from the friends would be 0 + 30. But wait, maybe the user already had some money?

The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors.\n\nThe user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which probably corresponds to 'moderate' in the price_range enum. The default is already 'moderate', so maybe that's covered. But I should explicitly set it to ensure. They also want outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be True. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. New York is a city, so maybe 'New York, NY' is correct. The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it out? Wait, the required parameters are category and location. Oh, the user didn't mention a category, so I need to ask for clarification. Wait, no, the function requires category. But the user hasn't provided it. Hmm, but maybe the category can be omitted? Wait, no, the parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants have 'category' and 'location' as required. So if the user didn't specify the category, I can't call the function without it. But the user's query doesn't mention a cuisine type. So maybe I need to inform them that the category is required. Wait, but the user might expect that the category can be optional. Wait, looking back at the function definition: the required parameters are category and location. So the category is mandatory. The user hasn't provided a category, so I can't proceed without it. But the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Since category is required, perhaps I need to make an assumption or ask the user for the category. However, the user hasn't specified, so maybe the assistant should point out that the category is required. Wait, but the user might not know the category. Alternatively, maybe the category can be left out? No, the function requires it. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the category is a required parameter and ask them to specify the type of cuisine they're interested in. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. So in this case, since category is required and not provided, the assistant should note that. But the user's message doesn't mention a category. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. Wait, but the user might not know they need to provide a category. So the assistant should respond that the category is required. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. So in this case, the assistant should not call the function and instead mention that the category is missing. But the user's query doesn't have the category. Therefore, the correct answer is to point out that the category is a required parameter and is missing. However, looking back at the function's parameters, the 'category' is required, and the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the assistant cannot make the function call and must indicate that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. So the assistant should respond that the category is required but not provided. However, the user might have intended to not specify a category, but the function requires it. Therefore, the correct action is to inform the user that the category is missing. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the assistant should not make a function call and instead indicate that the category is required. But the user's message is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Since category is required, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer is to point out that the category is missing. However, the user might not have provided the category, so the assistant should mention that. But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is a required parameter and is missing. However, looking back, the user's message says \"restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York\". There's no mention of category. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is required. But the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct answer is to not make a function call and instead state that the category is missing. However, the user might not know that category is required, so the assistant should inform them. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should only return function calls or point out if parameters are missing. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. However, the problem's example might have a different approach. Wait, let me check the function parameters again. The function Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants requires 'category' and 'location'. The user provided location as 'New York', but the function requires 'City, State' format. So 'New York, NY' is needed. Also, the price_range is 'moderate' as per the user's 'intermediate priced', which is in the enum. The has_seating_outdoors is True. But category is missing. Therefore, the assistant cannot call the function because category is required. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. However, the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is a required parameter and is missing. However, the problem says that the assistant should return the function calls if possible, else point out the missing parameters. Therefore, the correct answer here is to point out that the category is missing. But the user's message doesn't include the category. Therefore, the assistant cannot proceed. So the answer is to indicate that the category is required but not provided. However, the problem's instructions state that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to mention that the category is missing. However, the user might not know that, so the assistant should inform them. Therefore, the final answer is to point out that the category is a required parameter and is missing."}

For example, number_of_rooms in ReserveHotel defaults to 'dontcare', but the required parameters are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location.

Let me proceed with Danville, CA as the location.\n\nSo, using Movies_1_FindMovies with location set to 'Danville, CA', theater_name as 'Century Blackhawk Plaza', and show_type as 'imax'. The genre is not specified, so set it to the default 'dontcare'. That should retrieve the movies showing there in Imax. Let me check the parameters again.

The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia, Music_3_LookupMusic, and Weather_1_GetWeather. Since the user is asking to hear a song, the PlayMedia function seems relevant. But maybe they need to look up the song first?\n\nWait, the user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the style Hillbilly. The PlayMedia function requires a track, artist, device, and album. But the user hasn't specified the track title. They might need to look up the songs in that album from 2019 first. However, the LookupMusic function can retrieve songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The genre here is Hillbilly, but the enum for genre in LookupMusic doesn't include Hillbilly. The closest might be Country, since Hillbilly is a subgenre of Country. Also, the year 2019 is in the enum. The album is \"Gotta Be Me\". So maybe first use LookupMusic with album=Gotta Be Me, genre=Country, year=2019 to find the track. Then use PlayMedia with the track name and album. But the user hasn't provided the track name. Alternatively, maybe the PlayMedia function can be called with the album and artist, but the required parameter is track. Since the track isn't specified, maybe the assistant should first look up the tracks. However, the user's main request is to hear the song, so perhaps the assistant should directly try to play it, assuming that the system can handle it with the given parameters. But the required parameter for PlayMedia is track. Since the user hasn't provided the track title, the assistant can't call PlayMedia directly. Therefore, the correct approach is to first use LookupMusic to find the track(s) in the album \"Gotta Be Me\" from 2019 in the Country genre (since Hillbilly isn't in the enum, but Country is close). Then, once the track is found, use PlayMedia. However, the user's message is a single request. Since the assistant can only make one function call per turn, perhaps the first step is to call LookupMusic to get the track name. But the user might expect the assistant to play the song directly. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use PlayMedia with the album and year, but the required parameter is track. Since the track isn't provided, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct function to call here is Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Country\", year=\"2019\". This will retrieve the relevant tracks, which can then be played. But the user's instruction is to make one or more function calls. So the first step is to call LookupMusic to find the track, then PlayMedia. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So in this case, the first function call would be LookupMusic. The user's message doesn't specify the track, so the assistant can't call PlayMedia yet. Therefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album=Gotta Be Me, genre=Country, year=2019. The artist is not specified, so it defaults to 'dontcare'. That should retrieve the songs from the album Gotta Be Me in 2019 in the Country genre, which is the closest to Hillbilly. Then, once the tracks are found, the next step would be to call PlayMedia with the track name. But for the current turn, the assistant can only make the LookupMusic call."}

But the user says \"starting at one day before\", which is ambiguous. Maybe they meant the start time is 24 hours before, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe they meant the journey is on May 15, but the booking is for one day before. But the function parameters don't include booking date, just the journey date.

I'll proceed with May 15 as the date_of_journey, and the journey_start_time as the time on that day. However, the user hasn't specified the exact time, just \"starting at one day before\".

Since the function requires journey_start_time in 'HH:MM' format, but the user hasn't provided it, this is a missing parameter. Therefore, the function call can't be made as the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide a time, but it's not specified. In this case, the assistant should point out the missing parameter. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user's question is to make the function call if possible. Since journey_start_time is required and not provided, the function can't be called. But the user might have intended to provide a time, but it's missing. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user's question might have a typo, and \"starting at one day before\" could be a way to indicate the time, but it's unclear. Since the function requires a specific time, the assistant can't proceed without it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the journey_start_time is missing.

Both functions require user_id as a string. The include_expired is set to False by default, so I can omit it or include it explicitly.

The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the alert type is error rate with a threshold of 5%, and notifications should go to two emails.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The create_global_application_alert_config function seems right. It requires name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients.

The enabled parameter has a default of True, so unless specified, it's okay to leave it out. So I'll call that function with those parameters. The other functions like enable_global_application_alert_config require an ID, which the user hasn't provided yet, so they aren't needed here. The mobile app function isn't relevant for a global alert. So the correct call is to use create_global_application_alert_config with the specified parameters."}

The user is asking for all their API tokens and provided their user ID as 12345. They're pretty urgent with \"NOW!!!\" so I need to act quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There are two functions related to API tokens: CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. \n\nThe first function, get_shareable_api_tokens, requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The user provided the user_id as 12345, so that's covered. The default for include_revoked is False, which means it won't include revoked tokens unless specified. But the user didn't mention revoked tokens, so maybe they want all active ones. \n\nThe second function, get_api_tokens, doesn't require any parameters, but it has options like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user didn't specify anything about expired tokens, so the default of False for include_expired should be fine. However, since they want \"all\" tokens, maybe we need to paginate. The default page_size is 20, but if they have more than 20 tokens, we might need to adjust that. But the user didn't mention the number, so maybe just use the default. \n\nWait, the user's main goal is to get all their API tokens. The first function is about shareable API tokens, which might be a subset. The second function is a more general retrieval. Since the user didn't specify shareable, maybe the second function is more appropriate. But the first function also requires the user_id, which the user provided. \n\nHmm, but looking at the parameters, the get_api_tokens doesn't require the user_id. Wait, the user_id is part of the account, so maybe the functions are designed to be called with the user's authentication, so the user_id is already known. But in the first function, it's a required parameter. Since the user provided their user ID, maybe we should use the first function to get shareable tokens and the second to get all tokens. But the user might need all tokens, not just shareable ones. \n\nWait, the user's message is a bit urgent, so maybe they just want all tokens they have. The get_api_tokens function can retrieve them with the default parameters. But since the user provided the user_id, maybe the first function is necessary. However, the second function doesn't require the user_id. \n\nI think the correct approach is to use both functions to cover all possibilities. First, call get_shareable_api_tokens with the provided user_id to get the shareable tokens. Then, call get_api_tokens to retrieve all tokens, possibly with include_expired set to True if needed. Wait, the user didn't mention expired, but they said \"all\", so maybe include_expired should be True. However, the default is False. The user might not want expired ones, but the term \"all\" is ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all active tokens. Since the default for include_expired is False, that's probably safe. But to be thorough, maybe call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True to ensure all are covered. However, the user might not have specified, so perhaps stick to the default. \n\nSo, the plan is to first call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=False (default). Then, call get_api_tokens with include_expired=False (default), page=1, and maybe a larger page_size if possible. But the user didn't specify page_size, so default to 20. However, if there are more than 20 tokens, the user might not get all. But without knowing the total, it's hard to adjust. The user might need to handle pagination themselves. \n\nGiven the urgency, proceed with the available parameters. So, the two function calls would be:\n\n1. CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345\n2. api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with default parameters (include_expired=False, page=1, page_size=20)\n\nThis way, both shareable and general tokens are retrieved. The user can then combine the results. If there are more tokens beyond the first page, they might need to adjust the page parameter, but that's beyond the current step."}

The enum for that parameter includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. Perfect, that matches the user's query. \n\nThe parameters needed are 'experience_or_education_type' and optionally 'experience_or_education_name'.

No other parameters are necessary here. Let me make sure there's no other function that could be relevant.

The user provided the date as 2023-12-1, which is correct. Combining that with 7:00 AM, the time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' or maybe '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. The function accepts both 24-hour and 12-hour formats with AM/PM. Since the user wrote 7:00 AM, maybe using that format is better. The purpose is for a meeting, so I should include that. The default purpose is 'reminder', but specifying 'meeting' would be more accurate. So the parameters would be alarm_time: '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' and purpose: 'meeting'. Let me make sure the date is correct. The user wrote tomorro 2023-12-1. Assuming that's a typo for tomorrow, which would be December 1, 2023.
