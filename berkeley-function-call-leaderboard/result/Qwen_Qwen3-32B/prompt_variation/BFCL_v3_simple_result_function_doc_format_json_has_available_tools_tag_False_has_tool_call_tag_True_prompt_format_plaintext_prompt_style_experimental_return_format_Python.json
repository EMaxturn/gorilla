The database parameter has a default value of 'CustomerInfo', so if the user specifies a different database, we should use that.

Each roll of a die is independent, right? So the probability of getting a six on one roll is 1/6. For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance. Multiplying them gives (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. That's approximately 0.0278 or 2.78%. \n\nNow, looking at the available functions, there's one called probability.dice_roll. Let me check its parameters. It requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides. The user specified a six on a six-sided die, so desired_number is 6, number_of_rolls is 2, and die_sides is 6 (but since that's the default, maybe it's optional). \n\nSo the function call should include desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2. The die_sides can be omitted because it's six by default. Therefore, the correct function call is probability.dice_roll with those parameters. I don't see any missing parameters here. The user didn't mention any other sides, so the default is fine. This should calculate (1/6)^2, which is 1/36. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So the tool call should be correct."}

The user wants a recipe for pasta carbonara with less than 500 calories. I need to use the find_recipe function. The function requires the recipe name and has an optional maxCalories parameter. The default for maxCalories is 1000, but the user specified less than 500. So I should set maxCalories to 500. Wait, the parameter is called maxCalories, so if the user says \"less than 500\", then maxCalories should be 500. That makes sense. The required parameter is recipeName, which is \"pasta carbonara\". So the function call should include both parameters. Let me check the parameters again. Yes, recipeName is required, and maxCalories is optional with a default. So the correct call is find_recipe with recipeName=\"pasta carbonara\" and maxCalories=500. I need to make sure there are no typos. Also, the function is in Python syntax, but I'm just generating the call here. Alright, that should do it."}
