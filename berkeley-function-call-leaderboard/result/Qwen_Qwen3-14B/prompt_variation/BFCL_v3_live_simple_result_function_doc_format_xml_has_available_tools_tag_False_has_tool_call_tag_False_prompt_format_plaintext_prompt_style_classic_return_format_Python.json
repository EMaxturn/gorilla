The URL should be the base endpoint without query parameters. The example provided in the function's description includes 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

I need to figure out what query parameters the API expects. Since the example doesn't show specific parameters, but the user's question includes node ID, pod, and fabric, those might be the parameters. However, the function's parameters description says that 'params' is required, but the example doesn't show them. Maybe the API expects parameters like 'node_id', 'pod', 'fabric', or something similar. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"Ethernet interface statistics\" so maybe the endpoint is for interface info, and the parameters would include the node ID, pod, and fabric. But I need to make sure. Since the function's example URL doesn't include query parameters, the params dictionary would be added as query parameters. So I should construct the URL with the IP and then add the parameters like node_id=12, pod=10, fabric=Network1. \n\nBut I'm not sure if the API expects those exact parameter names. However, given the information provided, those are the parameters the user has given, so I'll use them.
