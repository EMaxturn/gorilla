That's 3.\n\n- start_date: string, like 'March 10th, 2023'. I need to ensure this format is acceptable; the description doesn't specify, so I'll use it as is.\n\n- preferences: an array of strings from the enum: ['pet_friendly', 'gym', 'swimming_pool', 'free_breakfast', 'parking']. They only mentioned \"pet friendly\", so I'll include just that.\n\nAll required parameters are present: location, room_type, duration, and start_date.\n\nSo, I can make a function call to \"hotel_booking\" with these parameters.\n\nThe response format must be exactly: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\n\nFor this, it's just one function call.\n\nLet me construct it:\n\n- func_name: hotel_booking\n\n- params:\n\n  - location: \"Manhattan, New York\"\n\n  - room_type: \"single\"\n\n  - duration: 3\n\n  - start_date: \"March 10th, 2023\"\n\n  - preferences: [\"pet_friendly\"]\n\nPreferences is an array, so I need to format it as a list in the call.\n\nIn the response, it should be like: hotel_booking(location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"March 10th, 2023\", preferences=[\"pet_friendly\"])\n\nAnd wrap it in square brackets if there are multiple, but since it's one, just that.\n\nThe instruction says: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, for a single one, it would be: [hotel_booking(location=\"Manhattan, New York\", room_type=\"single\", duration=3, start_date=\"March 10th, 2023\", preferences=[\"pet_friendly\"])]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nI don't need to add any other text; just this.\n\nThis fulfills the user's request in one turn."}
