The function signature in the docstring shows two arguments, one with a default. \n\n In the tool call, we are allowed to pass only the required parameters? \n\n Let me see the example in the instruction: it shows parameters as a dictionary.

We have the room from the question: \"living room\". \n\n Therefore, we can make the call with just the room.\n\n However, to be safe, let's check: the function might break if period is not passed? But it has a default. \n\n We are going to call without period.\n\n But note: the function might use the default period, which is 'Daily'.

So we can try:\n\n   art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n However, if the function expects a simple art form like \"sculpture\", then we might get no results. But we are instructed to use the function as provided.\n\n Alternatively, we can call the function with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then after getting the results, we might need to filter by the word \"modern\" in the title? But note: we cannot do that because we are only allowed to output function calls. And we cannot process the results because we are only making the call.\n\n So the plan is to use `find_exhibition` with:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"  ... but the user said \"modern sculpture\". Maybe we can try to pass \"modern sculpture\" and hope the backend can handle it? Or we can note that the function doesn't support style and we have to rely on the ratings to get the top ones and then hope that the top ones are modern? That is not guaranteed.\n\n Since the function does not have a parameter for style, we must use what we have. We'll set art_form to \"sculpture\", and then in the user_ratings set to 'high'. We also note that the default month returns upcoming events.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to set art_form to \"modern\" and see? But that might not be a form. The function expects an art form, and sculpture is the form.\n\n Let's read the function again: \"art_form (str): The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\"\n\n So we should use \"sculpture\". We cannot specify \"modern\". We have to hope that the backend returns exhibitions that are modern? Or maybe the function's backend already considers the art_form as including style? We don't know.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"sculpture\"\n   month: (we leave it default, which is upcoming events)\n   user_ratings: 'high' (which is the default, but we can set it explicitly to be safe? The default is 'high', so we can omit. But to be explicit, we can set it to 'high'.)\n\n However, note: the function has a default for month and user_ratings. So we can omit them? But the task says \"upcoming month\", so default for month is upcoming events, which is exactly what we want.\n\n But the function call requires the parameters. We must pass the required ones: location and art_form. The others are optional.\n\n So we call:\n   function: find_exhibition\n   parameters: \n        location: \"New York, NY\"\n        art_form: \"sculpture\"\n\n But note: the task says \"top rated\", so we want user_ratings to be high. Since it's the default, we can omit. However, if we want to be explicit, we can set it to 'high'. But the function doesn't specify what other values are allowed. We'll set it to 'high' to be safe.\n\n However, the function signature says user_ratings is a string and default is 'high'. So we can omit and it will use the default. But let's set it to 'high' to be explicit.\n\n Also note: the function returns the most popular exhibitions. We are not specifying how many. We assume it returns the top ones.\n\n Therefore, we will call:\n\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n But note: the function does not have a parameter for the number of results. So we assume it returns the top ones.\n\n However, the task says \"top rated\", so we are using the user_ratings='high' to get high rated ones, which should be the top.\n\n But what if we want the top one? The function doesn't specify. It returns the most popular (which might be multiple). We are only allowed to call the function as provided.\n\n So we will make the call and then the system will return the results. We don't have a function to then pick the top one? So we just call and return the call.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function returns the most popular, so it should be ordered? We don't have control over that.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n<TOOLCALL>```json\n[{\"function\":\"find_exhibition\",\"parameters\":{\"location\":\"New York, NY\",\"art_form\":\"sculpture\",\"user_ratings\":\"high\"}}]\n```</TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the function has a parameter `month` that we are not setting? The default is to return upcoming events, which is what we want. So we can omit.\n\n However, the function also has a default for `user_ratings`? We are setting it to 'high'. We could omit, but to be explicit we set it.\n\n Also note: the user said \"modern\", but we are not including that. We are relying on the fact that the exhibition of sculpture in New York with high ratings might include modern ones? Or the backend might have tagged them? We don't know. But we don't have a function that can filter by era.\n\n We have to work with what we have.\n\n Let's reconsider: is there any other function? We have `get_sculpture_info` but that is for a specific artist's artwork, not for exhibitions.\n\n So we proceed.\n\n However, note: the function `find_exhibition` returns exhibitions. We are not given a function to then get details of the exhibition. We are just returning the call.\n\n We are only making one call because we are only allowed to output the function call and then the system will use the result.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n\n But note: the function `find_exhibition` has a parameter `month` that we are not setting? We can set it to the upcoming month? But the function says the default returns upcoming events. So we don't need to set it.\n\n However, the upcoming month might be ambiguous. The function's default is \"upcoming events\", which might be more than one month? But the task says \"upcoming month\", meaning the next month? We don't know the exact behavior of the function. We trust the default.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the next month and set it? But we don't have a function to get the current date. And we are only allowed to use the provided functions.\n\n So we leave it to the function's default.\n\n Therefore, we output the call as above.\n\n But note: the function expects the location as a string in the format \"New York, NY\". We use that.\n\n Let me write the call:\n\n<TOOLCALL>```json\n[{\"function\":\"find_exhibition\",\"parameters\":{\"location\":\"New York, NY\",\"art_form\":\"sculpture\",\"user_ratings\":\"high\"}}]\n```</TOOLCALL>"}
{"id": "multiple_191", "result": "<TOOLCALL>```json\n[{\"function\": \"book_hotel\", \"parameters\": {\"hotel_name\": \"Hotel Paradise\", \"location\": \"Las Vegas\", \"room_type\": \"luxury\", \"start_date\": \"05-12-2022\", \"stay_duration\": 3, \"view\": \"city\"}}]\n```</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 620, "output_token_count": 304, "latency": 17.68095350265503, "reasoning_content": "We are given the task to book a luxury room in Hotel Paradise, Las Vegas, with a city view for 3 days starting from May 12, 2022.\n The function that can be used is `book_hotel`.\n The parameters required by the function are:\n   - hotel_name (str): The name of the hotel -> \"Hotel Paradise\"\n   - location (str): The location -> \"Las Vegas\"\n   - room_type (str): The type of room preferred -> \"luxury\"\n   - start_date (str): The starting date in MM-DD-YYYY format -> Note: the given date is May 12, 2022, which is 05-12-2022.\n   - stay_duration (int): The duration of the stay in days -> 3\n   - view (str, default='No preference'): We want a city view -> \"city\"\n\n We have all the required parameters.\n\n Let's format the date: May 12, 2022 -> 05-12-2022.\n\n We'll call the function with these parameters."}
