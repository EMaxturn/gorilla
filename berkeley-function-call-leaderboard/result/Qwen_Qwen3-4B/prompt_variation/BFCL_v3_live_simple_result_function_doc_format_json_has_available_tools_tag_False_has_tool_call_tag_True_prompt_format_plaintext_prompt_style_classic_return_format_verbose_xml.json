The other parameters like district_name and sub_district_name are not provided, so they can be omitted or set to default (None). The function doesn't require them, so it's okay.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly formatted. The service_id is integer, province_id is integer, rating is float, dates are strings in the correct format. That should cover the user's request."}

The parameters required are service_id, province_id, and others like district_name, sub_district_name, rating, etc.\n\nThe service type is ironing, which according to the enum in the function is service_id 2. Province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district is Sankampang, so district_name should be \"Sankampang\". The sub_district_name is \"Ton Pao\". The rating needed is 4.5, which is a float. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't specified, so maybe they can be left as default. Also, has_late_check_in is optional and defaults to False, so maybe we can omit it unless needed. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention availability dates, so those can be left as default. The rating is 4.5, which is within the 0.0-5.0 range. So the parameters would be service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name=\"Sankampang\", sub_district_name=\"Ton Pao\", rating=4.5. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.
