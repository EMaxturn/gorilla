The motion is along a straight line.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are kinematics.calculate_displacement and kinematics.calculate_final_speed. The question is about displacement, so the calculate_displacement function seems right. \n\nThe parameters required for calculate_displacement are initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20 m/s, acceleration as 10 m/s\u00b2, time as 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, but maybe the user wants two decimal places. \n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention rounding, but the default is 2. Maybe I should include it. So the parameters would be initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5, rounding=2. \n\nI should make sure there are no missing parameters. All required ones are provided. So the function call should be calculate_displacement with those values."}

The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. \n\nThe default region for 'store_price' is United States, so maybe I don't need to specify it, but it's safer to include it explicitly. The function requires all three parameters. Since the user provided all necessary info, I can call 'video_games.store_price' with those arguments. No other functions are needed here. The other functions are for checking if a game is on sale or fetching currency, which isn't relevant to the question."}

The user provided both values, 7 and 10. So I need to call this function with those parameters.\n\nI should make sure there are no missing parameters. The function doesn't require any other arguments, so it's straightforward. The calculation for the area is width multiplied by length, and the perimeter is 2*(width + length). Since the user provided both, I can directly use the function. No other functions are needed here. The answer should be the calculated values from the function."}

The user wants to find out how fast an object was going. They mentioned it started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the functions available. There's a function called calculate_speed_from_rest which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The default initial_speed is 0 if not provided. Since the object started from rest, initial_speed should be 0.\n\nThe user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. So I should use the calculate_speed_from_rest function with those parameters. The function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user didn't mention initial_speed, so I can assume it's 0. \n\nWait, but maybe the function expects initial_speed as a parameter. Let me check the function definition again. Yes, initial_speed is an int, default 0. So even if not provided, it's okay. So the parameters would be distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is calculate_speed_from_rest with those values. No other functions are needed here. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't relevant here because the question is about speed, not acceleration. So the answer is to call calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

The user provided both quantities and temperatures, so I can use that function. The other function, calculate_mass, is for mass given quantity and molar mass, which isn't needed here. \n\nSo I need to call calculate_final_temperature with quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. That should give the final temperature after mixing. I don't see any missing parameters here. The function requires all four arguments, and the user provided all.

The default for n_rolls is 1, but since they're rolling two dice, I need to set n_rolls to 2. The sides_per_die is the number of sides on each die.

The category here would be \"veterans\". The other functions are for population and demographics, which might not directly relate to veterans. \n\nThe user specified the year 1954.

So area is 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.\n\nNow, the coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. So, to find out how many gallons are needed, divide the total area by the coverage rate.
