There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the user is replacing the food item from whatever it was before with a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The original food item isn't specified, but the user is changing it to Caesar salad. So I'll set foodItem to \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients to \"anchovies\", and maybe set specialInstructions if needed. Since they didn't mention any other changes, maybe just removeIngredients is enough.\n\nThen for the drink, the user wants drink_id 123, size large, temperature hot, sweetness_level regular, milk_type almond. The ChaDri.change_drink function has parameters drink_id, new_preferences which includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The default for size is medium, so I need to set it to large. Temperature is hot, sweetness regular, milk almond. The default for milk_type is regular, so I need to change that to almond. The user didn't mention any special instructions, so special_instructions can be left as default.\n\nSo I need to call ChaFod with the food item and remove ingredients, and ChaDri.change_drink with the drink ID and the updated preferences. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the drink, the new_preferences should be a dictionary with the specified keys. The user didn't mention any other preferences, so the defaults for other fields like milk_type are okay to leave as default unless specified. Wait, the user specified almond milk, so milk_type should be almond. The default is regular, so that's correct. The size is large, temperature hot, sweetness regular. So the parameters are all set. \n\nI think that's all. The functions should be called with these parameters."}

The parameters required are location, category, and language. For the first request, Paris, France. The location should be in the format 'City, Country'. The category is general by default, but the user specified technology, so I need to set that. Language is English, which is the default, so maybe it's optional.

The user has given a series of steps to perform using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions I need to use.\n\nFirst step: Clone the repo. The user provided the URL git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and optionally destination, recursive, and depth. Since the destination is not specified, the default is '.' (current directory). So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The repo directory is the cloned one, so I'll use the cloned directory's name. But wait, the user didn't specify the directory name, so maybe the cloned repo's name is the directory. But the function requires the directory_name as a parameter. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. However, the function's parameter is directory_name, which should be a valid path relative to the root. Since the repo was cloned into the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's name. But the function's parameter is a string, so I need to pass the directory name. But the user hasn't specified a name, so perhaps the default is the cloned repo's name. But the function's parameters don't have a default for directory_name, so I need to specify it. Wait, the parameters for create_a_docker_file require directory_name, which is a required parameter. So I need to provide that. But the user hasn't specified the directory name, so maybe the cloned repo's name is the directory. But the function's parameter is a string, so I need to pass the directory name. However, the user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis.\" So perhaps the directory_name is the cloned repo's directory. But the function's parameter is directory_name, which is a string. So I need to pass the directory name as the parameter. But the user hasn't specified it, so maybe the default is the cloned repo's name. But the function's parameters don't have a default for directory_name, so I must provide it. However, the user's step 2.1 is part of the same process as the other steps. Maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's name. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the cloned repo's name. But the exact name might be the same as the repo URL. But the function's parameter is a string, so I need to pass it. Let's assume the directory_name is the cloned repo's name, which is \"nodejs-welcome\" (since the repo URL is nodejs-welcome.git). So the directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name. Again, the directory_name is the cloned repo's directory. So same as above, directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nStep 3: add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory_name is the cloned repo's directory. The commit message defaults to \"Update changes\", branch name is \"main\" by default, and force_push is false by default. So I can call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as the cloned repo's directory.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is the same as pushing all changes. So the push_git_changes_to_github function is used here.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url as git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, destination as '.' (default).\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name as \"nodejs-welcome\".\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name as \"nodejs-welcome\".\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as \"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message as \"Update changes\", branch_name as \"main\", force_push as false.\n\nBut I need to check if the functions are correctly called. The user's steps are in order, and each step requires a function call. So the JSON should include all these function calls in order."}

They need help finding relevant classes and the method signatures.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides several methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so I need to check if 'CellResult' is part of the repository. The available functions include 'get_relevant_classes' which can search the repository. The parameters are 'search_string' and 'include_subdirectories'. The user wants to include subdirectories, so set include_subdirectories to True.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters are 'class_name' and 'method_name'. So I'll call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'.\n\nWait, the user is using Java, but the functions listed are for Python. Oh, the functions are in Python 3 syntax, but the user is asking about Java. However, the functions provided don't have a language parameter for Java. The 'get_imports' function has a language enum, but the others don't. Hmm, but the user's question is about Java, but the functions are for Python. Wait, the user might be using a Python environment, but the problem is in Java. But the functions available are for Python. So maybe the user is using a Python tool to analyze Java code? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding. But according to the given functions, the 'get_relevant_classes' and 'get_signature' are for Python. So the answer would have to use those functions even if the problem is in Java. But the user's question is about Java, but the functions are for Python. However, the user might be using a Python tool to analyze their Java code. So proceed with the functions as given.\n\nSo, first call get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories True.
