The rounding isn't specified, so I can use the default of 2. \n\nI don't need to use the 'calculate_final_speed' here because the question is about displacement, not final speed.

The function requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, which matches the problem's condition. So I can use this function by passing distance=20, time=4. The function should calculate the final speed.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they're the same gas, maybe it's a weighted average? Wait, the formula for final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas would be (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) divided by the total quantity. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nSo, the formula would be T_final = (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2). That makes sense because the total internal energy is conserved. Since internal energy for an ideal gas depends only on temperature and quantity, adding them proportionally gives the final temperature. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. Perfect. The parameters are all provided in the question: quantity1 is 2, temperature1 is 300, quantity2 is 3, temperature2 is 400.

The user mentioned a roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, which is standard for dice.

The parameters required are location, art_form, month, and user_ratings. The location is New York, art_form should be sculpture. The month is upcoming, so I can leave it as default. User_ratings should be set to 'high' as per the default, but maybe specifying it ensures it's top-rated. Wait, the default for user_ratings is already 'high', so maybe that's covered. But the user said \"top rated,\" so maybe setting user_ratings to 'high' is correct. \n\nWait, the function's args mention user_ratings has a default of 'high', so even if not specified, it would use that. But since the user explicitly mentions \"top rated,\" it's better to set user_ratings to 'high' to make sure. Also, the month parameter's default is upcoming events, so if the user says \"upcoming month,\" using the default should work. \n\nSo the function call would be find_exhibition with location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", month=\"upcoming\", user_ratings=\"high\". Wait, the month argument's default is to return upcoming events, so maybe the month parameter can be omitted. But the user specified \"upcoming month,\" so including it might be redundant but safe. Alternatively, since the default is already upcoming, maybe just setting location and art_form, and user_ratings to high. \n\nWait, the function's month parameter says default returns upcoming events. So if the user wants the upcoming month, the default is sufficient. So the parameters needed are location, art_form, and user_ratings. But the user didn't mention a specific month, just \"upcoming,\" so the default is okay. \n\nSo the function call would be find_exhibition with location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\". Wait, but the user might want the month to be the upcoming one, which is the default. So maybe the month parameter can be left out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the month should be set to the current month's upcoming. But the function's default is to return upcoming events, so perhaps the month parameter is optional. \n\nSo the correct function call is find_exhibition with location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\". \n\nWait, but the user might want the month to be specified. Let me check the function's parameters again. The month argument has a default value of returning upcoming events. So if the user says \"upcoming month,\" the default is correct.

The user wants to book a luxury room at Hotel Paradise in Las Vegas with a city view for 3 days starting May 12, 2022. I need to check the available functions to see which one can handle this.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, the book_hotel function seems appropriate. Let me check its parameters. The arguments required are hotel_name, location, room_type, start_date, stay_duration, and view (optional). \n\nThe user specified all the necessary details: hotel name is Hotel Paradise, location is Las Vegas, room type is luxury, start date is May 12, 2022, stay duration is 3 days, and they want a city view. The view parameter is optional but the user has provided it. \n\nI need to make sure the date format is correct. The start_date should be in MM-DD-YYYY format. The user wrote May 12, 2022, which is MM-DD-YYYY if we consider May as 05. So the date should be 05-12-2022. \n\nAll parameters are present, so the function call should include all these details. Let me structure the JSON accordingly. The function name is book_hotel, and the parameters are hotel_name, location, room_type, start_date, stay_duration, and view. \n\nDouble-checking the parameters: yes, everything is there. No missing info. So the tool call should be correct."}
