The user wants to modify both their food and drink orders. \n\nFirst, looking at the food order: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is available for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The original food item isn't specified, but the user is changing it to a Caesar salad. So, foodItem should be \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients would be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might include the absence of anchovies, but the function's specialInstructions parameter is optional. So, I'll use ChaFod with foodItem set to \"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients set to \"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user refers to order 123 and wants it updated to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should be a dictionary. The user specified \"large hot coffee\" as the drink, but the function's parameter is for preferences, not the drink name. Wait, maybe the drink_id is the order ID, and the new_preferences include the drink details. But the function's description says it modifies the existing drink order based on preferences. So perhaps the new_preferences should include the drink type, size, sweetness, and milk. However, the function's parameters might expect the drink_id and the new preferences. The user is changing the drink to a large hot coffee with specific attributes. So, the new_preferences would be {\"drink\": \"large hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}. But I need to check if the function's new_preferences dict has specific keys. Since the function's parameters don't specify, I'll assume that the new_preferences can include these details. So, call ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences={\"drink\": \"large hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}.\n\nWait, but the function's new_preferences is a dict, but the exact keys aren't specified. Maybe the function expects certain keys like size, sweetness, etc. However, the user's request includes \"large hot coffee\" which might be the drink type and size. But since the function's parameters don't specify, I'll structure the new_preferences as per the user's instructions. So, the drink_id is 123, and the new_preferences include the drink type, sweetness, and milk. So the function call would be ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"drink\": \"large hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}).\n\nPutting it all together, two function calls are needed: one for the food and one for the drink."}

The user wants the latest news report for Paris, France in English and another for Letterkenny, Ireland, but this time focusing on technology news in English.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's get_news_report which requires location, category, and language. The location format is 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, since it's in France, the location should be 'Paris, France'. The category for the first one isn't specified, so it'll default to 'General', and language is 'en' as requested. \n\nThen for Letterkenny, Ireland. The user mentioned technology news here. So the category should be 'Technology'. The location format here would be 'Letterkenny, IE' since Ireland's country code is IE. Wait, but the function's example says 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So for countries, it's 'City, Country', but the state abbreviation might not apply here. Wait, the function's description says if the state isn't available, use 'City, Country'. So for Ireland, which is a country, the location should be 'Letterkenny, Ireland'. But the function's example uses 'San Francisco, CA' as a state abbreviation. So maybe for countries, it's 'City, Country', but the country name might need to be in the correct format. Wait, the function's args say location is in the format of 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So for Paris, France, it's 'Paris, France', and for Letterkenny, Ireland, it's 'Letterkenny, Ireland'. \n\nSo the first call is get_news_report with location='Paris, France', category='General', language='en'. The second call is get_news_report with location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en'. \n\nWait, the user said \"again in English\" for the second one, so the language is still 'en'.

The function's parameters are location, category, language. So yes, that's correct. The first call doesn't specify category, so it defaults to 'General'. The second specifies category as 'Technology' and language as 'en'. \n\nI think that's all. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so these two calls should cover the request."}

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires repo_url and maybe destination. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default, which is the current directory. So call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' or maybe just '.'? Wait, the function's argument is directory_name, which should be a path relative to the repo root. Since we cloned into the current directory, maybe the directory_name is '.' or the repo's name. Let me check the function's description again. It says the directory_name should be a valid path relative to the root of the repository. So if the repo is cloned into the current working directory, the directory_name would be '.' or the repo's folder name. Let's assume the repo is cloned into a folder named 'nodejs-welcome', so directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. Wait, but the user didn't specify the destination, so maybe the default is current directory, so the directory_name would be '.'? Hmm, maybe the function expects the directory name where the repo is located. Let me proceed with 'nodejs-welcome' as the directory name after cloning.\n\nOnce analyzed, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs directory_name. So same as above, 'nodejs-welcome'. Then, create_kubernetes_yaml_file also needs directory_name, which is the same. But the user mentioned to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. Wait, the analysis would determine the programming language, which might influence the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. But the functions don't take the language into account. Wait, the analyse_repo_contents function returns the predominant language, but the functions for Docker and Kubernetes don't have parameters for that. So maybe the analysis is just to confirm the language, but the actual creation of Dockerfile and YAMLs uses default parameters. The user's step 2.1 says to create/update Dockerfile based on analysis. But the function create_a_docker_file doesn't take any parameters except directory_name. So perhaps the analysis is just to determine the language, but the Dockerfile creation is done regardless. Maybe the analysis is just part of the process, but the actual Dockerfile is created with default settings. So proceed with creating the Dockerfile in the repo directory.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify deployment name, so use default. Image name defaults to 'latest', replicas to 1, port 80, service type ClusterIP. So call that function with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter creating the files, add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The user's step 3 says to add all changed files to Git changes. Wait, the function push_git_changes_to_github automatically git add all changes. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome', commit message as 'Update changes', branch 'main', and force_push False.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changes to Git\". The push_git_changes_to_github function does git add, so maybe that's covered. So the steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo to get the language (though the functions don't use it, but the step is there).\n3. Create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on analysis (but the functions don't take language into account, so maybe the analysis is just to confirm, but the functions proceed with defaults).\n4. Push the changes.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says to add all changed files to Git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function does git add, so maybe that's part of the push process. So after creating the files, call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a step before committing. However, the push_git_changes_to_github function automatically adds changes. So perhaps the user's step 3 is covered by the push function. So the order is:\n\nAfter cloning, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo with the given URL.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_a_docker_file with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome' and other defaults.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 3 says to add all changed files to Git changes. The push function does that, so maybe that's covered. So the functions are called in order.\n\nNow, check if all parameters are provided. For clone_repo, repo_url is given. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo is cloned into that directory). For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is same. For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name is same, and other parameters have defaults. For push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name is same, commit message is default, branch is default.\n\nSo the function calls should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]</TOOLCALL>"}

The function get_relevant_classes seems perfect here. They mentioned including subdirectories, so I should set include_subdirectories to True. The search_string would be \"CellResult\".\n\nNext, they need the signatures of setCellValue and getCellValue in AbstractCellHandler. The get_signature function can retrieve method signatures. I'll need to call this twice, once for each method. For each call, the class_name is AbstractCellHandler, and the method_name is setCellValue and getCellValue respectively. Also, since the user is overriding methods, maybe include_private should be considered, but the default is False. However, if the methods are private, they might need to be included. But the user hasn't specified that, so stick with default.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error about getNumericValue() in CellResult. Maybe CellResult doesn't have that method, so they need to check if there's a related class that does. But the first part of the query is to find classes related to CellResult, so using get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories=True should help find possible classes.\n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search_string \"CellResult\", case_sensitive=False (default), include_subdirectories=True. Then, call get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue and getCellValue methods.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set.

The units here are centimeters, but the function might just return the numerical value since the unit is part of the input description.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. Maybe they meant Singapore, or perhaps there's a mix-up. But I should go with what's written. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The format should be like 'City, Country' or 'City, State'. Singapore is a city-state, so 'Singapore, Singapore' might work. Alternatively, just 'Singapore' could be acceptable, but to be safe, including the country. Also, the unit is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit. But the user didn't specify, so I'll use the default. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\". That might be a mistake. Queenstown is in New Zealand, and Singapore is a different country. Maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand? Or perhaps they intended Singapore. But since the user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\", I should check if that's a valid location. If not, the function might return an error. But since I have to proceed, maybe it's a typo. However, as per the given question, I should use the exact terms provided.

They want two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment at 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nLooking at the available functions, Services_1_FindProvider is for searching stylists in a city, and Services_1_BookAppointment is for booking. The user provided both the city and the salon name, so I need to call both functions.\n\nFor the first part, the city is Sunnyvale, CA. The function requires city in 'City, State (abbr)' format, which the user provided. The is_unisex parameter is optional with default 'dontcare', so I can omit it unless specified. The user didn't mention unisex, so just the city is enough.\n\nNext, booking the appointment. The function needs stylist_name, which is 'Elegant Styles', appointment_time as '15:00', and appointment_date as '2023-05-10'. All required parameters are provided. \n\nWait, does the booking function require the stylist's name exactly as in the search? The user mentioned 'Elegant Styles' as the salon name, so I'll use that as the stylist_name. The date and time are correctly formatted. \n\nSo, two function calls: one to find providers in Sunnyvale, CA, and another to book the appointment with the given details. No missing parameters here. The weather function isn't needed here. Everything seems covered."}
