The initial_velocity is optional and defaults to zero, so since the user specified it's zero, I can include that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so unless they mention a different gravity, I don't need to change that. So the parameters would be height=150, initial_velocity=0. Wait, the parameters are all integers except gravity, which is a float. So the function call should include height as 150, initial_velocity as 0, and gravity as 9.81 by default.

For the first condition, field is 'age', operation is '>', value is '25'. Wait, the value type in the parameters is string, so even though age is a number, the value should be a string '25'.

Since they want two sixes in a row, I need to multiply the probability of each individual event. So it's (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. \n\nNow, looking at the functions provided, there's the probability.dice_roll function. Let me check its parameters. The function requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and optionally die_sides which defaults to 6. The user is asking about rolling a six (desired_number=6) twice (number_of_rolls=2) on a six-sided die. Since die_sides is optional and defaults to 6, I don't need to specify it unless the die has a different number of sides. \n\nSo the correct function call would be probability.dice_roll with desired_number=6 and number_of_rolls=2.
