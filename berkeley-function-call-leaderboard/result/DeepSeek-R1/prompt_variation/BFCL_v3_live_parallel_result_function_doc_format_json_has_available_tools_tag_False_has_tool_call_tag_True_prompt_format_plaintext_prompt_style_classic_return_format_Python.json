Since the user didn't specify, we can use the default.\n Alternatively, we might consider that in the US, Fahrenheit is more common, but the function defaults to celsius.\n But the function's default is set, and the user didn't specify, so we can stick to the default or let the system use the default.\n However, the problem says: if the given question lacks parameters required, point it out.

But note: the function has a default of celsius.\n We are allowed to change the unit by providing the 'unit' parameter. So we can set unit='fahrenheit' for both calls.\n\n Alternatively, we could stick to the default. However, the user might be expecting Fahrenheit. Since the question doesn't specify, we can choose.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n The required parameter is only 'location'. The 'unit' is optional. So we are not required to point it out.\n\n However, to be safe and because the user is in the US, we will use Fahrenheit.\n\n Therefore, we will call:\n   get_current_weather(location=\"Boston, MA\", unit=\"fahrenheit\")\n   get_current_weather(location=\"San Francisco, CA\", unit=\"fahrenheit\")\n\n But note: the function also has an optional 'url' parameter.

But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n Since the input question uses double quotes for the cities? Actually, the question doesn't use quotes. We are free to choose.\n\n We'll use double quotes for the string values.\n\n However, note: the function expects the location in the format \"City, State\".

However, the function does not allow arbitrary units (only from enum). \n     We don't have a unit for a drink. The enum has 'cup', so we can use that.

But note: the function requires portion_amount and portion_unit. \n     We'll use portion_amount=1.0 and portion_unit='cup'. Alternatively, if we are not sure, we might need to ask, but the instruction says if lacking parameters, point it out. \n     However, the system requires to output function calls.

The user mentioned \"earlier\", so we should set the `log_date` for the earlier event to a time in the past. \n But the problem: we don't have the exact time. The function defaults `log_date` to None, which might mean the current time. \n We are not given an exact time for \"earlier\", so we cannot set an exact ISO string. Therefore, we might have to log the earlier event without a specific time? \n But note: the function allows `log_date` to be None, which might be interpreted as the current time. That would be incorrect for the earlier event.\n\n Since the problem does not specify how to handle the time, and we don't have the exact time, we have two options:\n   Option 1: Log the earlier event without a time (i.e., set log_date to None) and hope the system uses the current time? But that would be the same as the current event.\n   Option 2: We don't log the earlier event because we lack the time? But the user wants to log it.\n\n However, the function does not require `log_date` (it's not in the required list). So we can omit it. But the system might log both at the same time? \n\n The problem says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. \n For the earlier event, we lack the exact time. But the function does not require `log_date` (it's optional). So we can log without it? \n But note: the description says `log_date` defaults to None. So we can leave it out.\n\n However, the user might expect the earlier event to be logged at a different time. We are not given that time, so we cannot set it. \n We must log without the time? Or should we set the `log_date` to a placeholder? The function expects ISO 8601 or None. \n\n Since we don't have the exact time, we will log the earlier event without specifying `log_date` (i.e., use the default None). \n But note: the system might log both events as happening at the same time (now). \n\n Alternatively, we can ask the user for the time? But the instruction says to output function calls. And we are only allowed to output function calls. \n Since we cannot ask, we must do our best: log the earlier event without a time and hope the system can handle it? \n However, the problem says: if lacking parameters, point it out. But `log_date` is not required. So we can leave it out.\n\n But wait: the function definition says `log_date` has a default of None. So we can omit it.\n\n Therefore, we will log:\n   For the current event (without specifying log_date, which will default to current time?):\n      frozen mango: food_name='frozen mango', portion_amount=8, portion_unit='piece'\n      chai tea: food_name='chai tea', portion_amount=1, portion_unit='cup'\n\n   For the earlier event (without log_date, which might also default to current time? but that's not correct) we have a problem.\n\n How can we distinguish the two events? The user said \"earlier\", so we must set the time for the earlier event to be in the past? \n We don't have that information. Therefore, we must note that we cannot log the earlier event without knowing the time? \n But the function does not require the time, so technically we can log it without. However, the system might log both at the same time.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the `log_date` for the current event to the current time and for the earlier event to a time that is a few hours ago? \n But we don't know exactly. This is arbitrary.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we are not allowed to ask, we must do our best. \n We will log the current event without a time (so it gets the current time) and the earlier event without a time (so it also gets the current time) which is not correct.\n\n This is a limitation. But note: the function does not require `log_date`. So we are allowed to omit it. \n\n However, the user might be logging both at the same time? But the user said \"earlier\" meaning they are two separate events.\n\n We have to assume that the system will handle the time of logging by the order of calls? But that's not reliable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the `log_date` parameter for the earlier event and set it to a relative time? \n But we don't know the exact time. We can set it to a few hours ago? But without knowing the current time, we cannot compute an ISO string.\n\n Therefore, we decide to log without `log_date` for both and hope the user corrects it later? \n Or note: the system might record the time when the function is called. So if we call the function twice, the earlier event function call might be recorded with a timestamp? \n But the function itself has a parameter for the time of consumption, not the time of logging.\n\n Since we don't have the time of consumption for the earlier event, we leave it out. \n\n But wait: the function definition for `log_date` says: \"The date and time when the food was consumed\". So we are missing that for the earlier event. \n We must point out that we lack the parameter? The instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n However, the function does not require `log_date` (it's not in the required list). So we are not forced to have it. \n Therefore, we can log without it.\n\n However, to be safe, we should log the current event with the current time (which we can get from the system) and the earlier event without? \n But the function doesn't require it, so we can omit.\n\n So we will make four function calls:\n\n 1. Log frozen mango (current event)\n 2. Log chai tea (current event)\n 3. Log pepperoni pizza (earlier event)\n 4. Log coffee (earlier event)\n\n But note: the function has a parameter `meal_type` with default 'snack'. We don't have that information, so we use the default.\n\n However, the user might have intended the earlier event to be for lunch and the current for snack? But we don't know.\n\n We leave the meal_type as the default.\n\n Therefore, the function calls:\n\n For the current event (frozen mango and chai tea) we assume they are both for the same meal? But the user didn't specify. \n We can log them both as snack? That's the default.\n\n For the earlier event (pizza and coffee) we also use the default.\n\n We'll make four separate calls.\n\n Let's write the calls:\n\n Call 1: frozen mango\n   food_name: 'frozen mango'\n   portion_amount: 8.0\n   portion_unit: 'piece'\n\n Call 2: chai tea\n   food_name: 'chai tea'\n   portion_amount: 1.0\n   portion_unit: 'cup'\n\n Call 3: pepperoni pizza\n   food_name: 'pepperoni pizza'\n   portion_amount: 2.0\n   portion_unit: 'slice'\n\n Call 4: coffee\n   food_name: 'coffee'\n   portion_amount: 1.0\n   portion_unit: 'cup'\n\n We are not setting `meal_type` or `log_date` so they will use the defaults.\n\n However, note that the earlier event should be marked as having happened at a different time? We don't have that time, so we omit.\n\n We output the function calls in the required format."}

The example is 'San Francisco, CA'. \n So we must have a state. \n\n How about we use the same approach as the example? The example uses \"CA\" for San Francisco.
