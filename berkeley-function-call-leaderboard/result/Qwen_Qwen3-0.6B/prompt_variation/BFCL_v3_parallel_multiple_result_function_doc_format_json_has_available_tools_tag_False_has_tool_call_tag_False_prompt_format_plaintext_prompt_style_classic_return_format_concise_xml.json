The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures: a 4x4 ft marble statue in the Museum of Philadelphia and a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in the New York museum.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There are two functions: get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nLooking at get_sculpture_details, it requires a museum location and a sculpture ID. The user provided both locations but didn't mention specific IDs. The other function, get_artwork_price, requires the museum location, sculpture material, and dimensions (as an array of integers). \n\nThe user mentioned two sculptures. For the marble statue in Philadelphia, I need to get its details. But the function requires a sculpture ID. Since the user didn't provide that, maybe I can't use this function. However, maybe the sculpture ID is part of the parameters. Wait, the parameters for get_sculpture_details are 'museum_location' and 'sculpture_id'. The sculpture ID is an integer. But the user didn't specify the ID. So perhaps I can't retrieve that information without the ID. \n\nFor the bronze sculpture in New York, the function get_artwork_price needs the museum location, material, and dimensions. The user provided the material (bronze) and the dimensions (6 and 3 ft), and the location (New York). So maybe I can use get_artwork_price for both sculptures. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking for the average price. So I need to call both functions for each sculpture, then average the prices. However, the functions don't have a way to combine results. The problem is that each function gives a single price. So I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each sculpture, and then take the average. \n\nBut the user's question is about the average price, so I need to make two function calls. Let me check the parameters again. For get_artwork_price, the parameters are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size (array). The user provided both locations and materials, but the dimensions for the bronze sculpture are 6 and 3. So for the bronze sculpture, the parameters would be museum_location: \"New York\", sculpture_material: \"bronze\", and sculpture_size: [6,3]. \n\nFor the marble sculpture, the museum_location is \"Museum of Philadelphia\", but the function requires a sculpture_id. Since the user didn't provide that, maybe I can't call get_sculpture_details here. But perhaps the sculpture ID is part of the parameters. Wait, the parameters for get_sculpture_details are 'museum_location' and 'sculpture_id'. The sculpture_id is an integer. The user didn't provide it, so maybe that's a problem. \n\nBut maybe the user expects that the sculpture exists, and the ID is available. However, without the ID, I can't call the function. Therefore, I need to make two function calls: one for each sculpture, using the available parameters. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_artwork_price with museum_location \"Museum of Philadelphia\", sculpture_material \"marble\", and sculpture_size [4,4]. \n\n2. Call get_artwork_price with museum_location \"New York\", sculpture_material \"bronze\", and sculpture_size [6,3]. \n\nThen, average the two prices. \n\nBut wait, the user's question is about the average price. So the functions need to return the individual prices, and then compute the average. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to make two function calls, each for one sculpture, and then compute the average. \n\nSo the final answer would be two function calls, each with the respective parameters."}

The glucose conversion efficiency is 10%, which is 0.1. The energy per mole is 2800 kJ/mol. So, energy = moles * efficiency * energy per mole. That should be 5 * 0.1 * 2800. Let me check the parameters. The function 'biological.calc_energy' requires mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The substance here is glucose, which is C6H12O6. The default for glucose is 2800 kJ/mol, so maybe I don't need to specify it, but since the user provided it, I should include it. So the first function call would be biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', and joules_per_mol=2800.0.\n\nSecond part: Calculate biomass given energy and efficiency.

The available functions are team_stats.get_top_scorer, league_stats.get_top_scorer, and player_stats.get_all_time_goals.\n\nStarting with the first part: Cristiano Ronaldo's all-time goals for Manchester United in the Premier League. The player_stats function requires player_name, team_name, and optionally competition. Since the user specified Manchester United and the competition is Premier League, I can use player_stats with player_name \"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name \"Manchester United\", and competition \"Premier League\". That should get the goals.\n\nNext, comparing that with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition. The team_stats function can fetch the top scorer.

The competition parameter is optional, so maybe just leave it out, but the default is Premier League. Wait, the default is \"Premier League\" if not specified. So if I don't include competition, it's okay. But the user is asking for the same competition, so maybe include it explicitly.

For example, in the first call, the competition is \"Premier League\" as specified. The second call doesn't need competition since it's the default.

The problem states there are 4 possible royal flush outcomes in a 52-card deck, and the result should be rounded to 3 decimal places. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. Total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4, and round_to is 3. So I'll call that function with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For the painting, the size is a string, medium is a string, dominant_color is a string. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years is an integer, model is a string. For the probability, total_outcomes is integer, favorable is integer, round_to is integer. All parameters are correctly specified. No missing parameters here. So I'll list each function call accordingly."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, and built in 1985. The function predict_house_price requires area, rooms, year, and location. All these parameters are provided, so I can use that.\n\nNext, they need information about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. The default state is California, so even if not specified, it's okay. So I'll call lawsuit_search with those parameters.\n\nThen, the probability part: total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user specified all three, so I'll use that.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly with the right parameters. Let me check again: yes, all required parameters are present. No missing parameters. So the three function calls should cover all parts of the user's request."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nLooking at the functions available, the first part is about collectables in a game. The 'get_collectables_in_season' function requires game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so I need to set item_type to 'fish'. The parameters are correct here.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The 'game_score.highest' function needs game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia. So that's covered.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The 'lawsuit_details.find' function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided Apple Inc. and 2018, but case_type isn't mentioned. The default is all, so maybe case_type can be omitted. But since the user didn't specify, maybe include it as optional. Wait, the required parameters are company_name and year, so case_type is optional. So I can call it with those two.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The 'calculate_binomial_probability' function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user specified 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. All required parameters are there.\n\nNow, I need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted. Let me check each function's parameters again. For 'get_collectables_in_season', game_name is 'Animal Crossing', season 'Summer', item_type 'fish'. For 'game_score.highest', game 'Fortnite', platform 'PlayStation', region 'Asia'. For 'lawsuit_details.find', company 'Apple Inc.', year 2018. For the binomial, trials 10, successes 3, probability 0.7. All parameters are correctly set. No missing parameters. So the function calls should be in the required format."}
