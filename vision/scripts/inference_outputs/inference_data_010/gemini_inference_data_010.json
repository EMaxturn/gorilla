Now, I will perform a Google search focusing on \"Australian female breaker Paris 2024\" to find the athlete's name and competition results. My goal is to determine the rank she achieved in her Olympic debut. Discovering Rachael's Rank I've established that Rachael Gunn, aka B-Girl Raygun, competed in breaking at the Paris 2024 Olympics. My preliminary research shows she didn't progress past the round-robin stage. However, I still need to pinpoint her precise final ranking. I'm focusing my search on official Olympic results and news articles to solidify this. Locating Final Standings I've determined Rachael Gunn's elimination in the round-robin stage at the Paris 2024 Olympics, but I still need her final numerical ranking. Search results have highlighted her performance and subsequent ranking within the World DanceSport Federation, but lack the precise standings. To finalize my analysis, I'm now focusing on finding a source explicitly listing the comprehensive final results for the women's breaking event at the Olympics. Ascertaining Final Ranking I've determined Rachael Gunn's event and confirmed her participation in the Olympic debut of breaking. Through multiple search results and Wikipedia, her performance is clear: eliminated in round-robin. I found the final standings on Wikipedia and identified her rank as 15. This confirms that I have the answer to the user's inquiry."
