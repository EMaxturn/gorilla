There's animal_population.get_history for historical data and animal_population.get_projection for projections.

The file path is dataset.csv, and the delimiter is comma by default. So I should call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv' and delimiter=','). That should load the data into a structure, probably a DataFrame.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], so I need to extract those columns from the loaded data. But wait, the function's parameters are x and y as lists. So after loading the data, I need to convert the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns into lists. Assuming the data is a DataFrame, I can do something like x = data['sales'].tolist() and y = data['future_sales'].tolist().\n\nThen, the function needs to fit the model and return residuals. The return_residuals parameter is a boolean, defaulting to false.

The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures in different museums. The first one is a 4 ft x 4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6 ft x 3 ft bronze sculpture in New York.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it takes material and size parameters. The other function, get_sculpture_details, might not be necessary here since the user is asking for price, not details.\n\nSo, for the first sculpture in Philadelphia: material is marble, size is 4ft x 4ft. The function get_artwork_price requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The sculpture_size is a list, so I need to pass it as [4,4]. The museum_location is Philadelphia.\n\nThen, the second sculpture in New York: material is bronze, size is 6x3. Again, sculpture_size is [6,3], museum_location is New York. \n\nWait, the function parameters for get_artwork_price: the sculpture_size is a list. So for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with the respective parameters. Then, after getting both prices, average them.\n\nBut the user wants the average price. So I need to call the function twice, once for each sculpture, then compute the average. However, the functions can't compute the average directly; they just return the price. So the user's answer would be the average of the two prices obtained from the functions.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Call get_artwork_price for Philadelphia marble statue with museum_location=\"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4].\n2. Call get_artwork_price for New York bronze sculpture with museum_location=\"New York\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3].\n3.

However, the functions don't compute the average; they just return the individual prices. So the assistant needs to call the functions and then compute the average.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant should only return the function calls. So the assistant should make the two function calls and then, in the next step, compute the average. However, the user might expect the assistant to handle the calculation, but the problem says to return the function calls. Wait, the user's question is to get the average price, so the assistant needs to call the functions and then compute the average. But the assistant can't do the calculation here; the assistant can only make the function calls. So the answer would be the two function calls, and then the average would be calculated by the assistant's own logic.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return the function calls. So the answer would be the two function calls. However, the user might need the average, but the assistant can't compute it here. Wait, but the user's question is to find the average price, so the assistant must make the function calls and then compute the average. But since the assistant can't do that in this step, perhaps the answer is to call the functions and then the average is derived from the results. But the problem says to return the function calls, not the result. So the assistant should only return the function calls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to call get_artwork_price for both sculptures."}

The user has three parts to their question, each involving different calculations. Let me break them down.\n\nFirst, the user wants to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The given energy per mole is 2800 kJ/mol, and the efficiency is 10%. Wait, but the first part says the energy produced from glucose is 2800 kJ/mol. But the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%. So the total energy from glucose would be 5 moles * 2800 kJ/mol. Then, the bacteria's efficiency is 10%, so the total energy they produce is that value multiplied by 10%? Or is the efficiency the percentage of energy converted into biomass? Hmm, the problem says the conversion efficiency is 10%, so the energy converted into biomass is 10% of the total energy from glucose. Wait, the first part says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\" and the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%. So the total energy from glucose is 5 * 2800 = 14000 kJ. Then, the bacteria's efficiency is 10%, so the energy converted into biomass is 14000 * 0.1 = 1400 kJ. But the user's first part asks for the total energy produced by the bacteria, which would be 1400 kJ. Wait, but the problem says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\" and the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%. So the total energy from glucose is 5 * 2800 = 14000 kJ. Then, the bacteria's efficiency is 10%, so the energy converted into biomass is 14000 * 0.1 = 1400 kJ. But the first part of the question says \"calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming the glucose.\" So that would be 1400 kJ. But maybe the efficiency is the percentage of energy converted into biomass, so the total energy from glucose is 14000 kJ, and the bacteria's efficiency is 10%, so the energy converted into biomass is 1400 kJ. But the question says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\" and the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%. So the total energy produced by the bacteria would be 5 * 2800 * 0.1 = 1400 kJ. So the first part is using the calc_energy function with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800. Then, the second part is using the biological.calc_biomass function with energy=1400 and efficiency=0.1. Wait, but the problem says the conversion efficiency is 10%, so the efficiency parameter in the calc_biomass function would be 0.1. But the user's question says the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%, so that's the efficiency parameter. Then, the third part is calculating the work done by the machine, which is energy (from the first part) multiplied by distance (2 meters). So the work would be 1400 kJ * 2 m. But the work function requires energy and distance. So the third part would use the physical.calc_work function with energy=1400 and distance=2. But wait, the energy in the first part is 1400 kJ, which is 1400000 J. So the work would be 1400000 J * 2 m = 2,800,000 J. But the function might expect energy in kJ or J. The function's parameters are energy (float) and distance (float). So the user would need to pass the energy as 1400 (kJ) and distance as 2. But the physical.calc_work function's energy is in joules? Wait, the function's description says \"Calculate the work from energy.\" So the energy parameter is in whatever units the function expects. But the user's first part is in kJ, so maybe the function expects energy in kJ. But the function's parameters are energy (float) and distance (float). So the user would need to pass the energy as 1400 (kJ) and distance as 2. But the work function's description says \"work from energy\" but the parameters are energy and distance. So the work is energy * distance. So the third part would be using physical.calc_work with energy=1400 and distance=2. But the user's first part is the total energy from glucose, which is 5 * 2800 * 0.1 = 1400 kJ. So the first function call is biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800. Then, the second function call is biological.calc_biomass with energy=1400 and efficiency=0.1. Then, the third part is physical.calc_work with energy=1400 and distance=2. But wait, the first part's energy is 1400 kJ, which is 1400000 J. But the function's parameters are energy (float) and distance (float). So the user would need to pass 1400 as energy (kJ) and 2 as distance. But the function's parameters are in the same units as the energy. So the user would need to pass 1400 (kJ) and 2 (meters). So the third function call is physical.calc_work with energy=1400 and distance=2. But the user's question says the machine needs to move 2 meters, so the distance is 2. So the three function calls are:\n\n1. biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800.\n2. biological.calc_biomass with energy=1400 (from the first step) and efficiency=0.1.\n3. physical.calc_work with energy=1400 and distance=2.\n\nBut wait, the first step's energy is 5 * 2800 * 0.1 = 1400 kJ. So the first function call is biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800. Then, the second function call is biological.calc_biomass with energy=1400 and efficiency=0.1. Then, the third is physical.calc_work with energy=1400 and distance=2. But the user's third part says \"calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\" So the energy is 1400 kJ, and distance is 2 meters. So the third function call is physical.calc_work with energy=1400 and distance=2. But the function's parameters are energy (float) and distance (float). So the user would need to pass those values. Therefore, the three function calls are as above."}

John has three investment options, and I need to calculate the returns for each using the provided functions. Let me break down each option and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, the first option is a simple interest scheme with a principal of $5000, a duration of 5 years, and an annual rate of 4%. The calc_Simple_Interest function seems appropriate here. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I'll call that function with 5000, 5, and 4.\n\nNext, the second option is compound interest with the same principal of $5000, 5 years, and an annual rate of 3.5%. The calc_Compound_Interest function requires principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it compounds annually, compound_freq should be 1. So I'll use that function with 5000, 5, 3.5, and 1.\n\nThird, the third option is an initial investment of $3000 at 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. Here, the principle is $3000, duration is 6, annual_rate is 5%, and compound_freq is 2. So I need to call calc_Compound_Interest again with these parameters. Wait, but the user mentioned using the future_value function as well. Wait, the question says to use calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively. So for the third option, maybe the future_value function is needed? Let me check the functions again.\n\nLooking at the functions: future_value calculates the future value, which is the same as the compound interest result. But the user specified to use the three functions. So for the third option, maybe the future_value function is required. But the problem says to use the three functions. Wait, the user says \"using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So each option should be calculated with one of these functions.\n\nWait, the third option is an initial amount of $3000 at 5% for 6 years, compounded twice a year. So the future_value function would calculate that. But the user mentioned using calc_Compound_Interest. Hmm. Let me check the function descriptions again.\n\nThe calc_Compound_Interest function's description says it computes compound interest, which is the same as future value. So maybe the future_value function is redundant here. But the user wants to use all three functions. Wait, the question says \"using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So each option is calculated with one of these functions. So for the third option, maybe the future_value function is used. But the user might have intended to use calc_Compound_Interest for the third option. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe third option's parameters are: initial_investment $3000, annual rate 5%, time 6 years, compound_freq 2. So the future_value function would take initial_investment, interest_rate, time, and num_compoundings. The calc_Compound_Interest function takes principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, compound_freq. So maybe the user wants to use future_value for the third option. But the question says to use the three functions. So perhaps the third option is calculated with future_value, but the user might have intended to use calc_Compound_Interest. But the user's instruction is to use the three functions. So I need to make sure each option is calculated with the correct function.\n\nWait, the user's question says: \"using the calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value functions respectively.\" So each of the three options is calculated with one of these functions. So for the first option, calc_Simple_Interest. Second option, calc_Compound_Interest. Third option, future_value. But the third option's parameters are initial_investment, which is $3000, interest_rate 5%, time 6, compound_freq 2. So the future_value function would take initial_investment, interest_rate, time, num_compoundings. So the parameters for future_value would be initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2. But the user's question says to use future_value for the third option. So I need to call future_value with those parameters.\n\nBut the user also mentioned that the third option is a compound interest scheme. However, the future_value function is for calculating future value, which is the same as compound interest. So maybe the user wants to use future_value for the third option. But the problem is that the user's question says to use the three functions. So the third option is calculated with future_value, and the other two with the other functions.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest with principle 5000, duration 5, annual_rate 4.\n2. calc_Compound_Interest with principle 5000, duration 5, annual_rate 3.5, compound_freq 1.\n3. future_value with initial_investment 3000, interest_rate 0.05, time 6, num_compoundings 2.\n\nBut wait, the third option's parameters are initial_investment, which is 3000, and the interest rate is 5% (so 0.05), time is 6, and compound_freq is 2. So the future_value function would take those parameters. So the third function call is future_value with those values.\n\nSo the final answer would be three function calls: one for each option using the respective functions."}

There's european_history.get_monarchs, which requires country and century. For France and 17th century, that's straightforward. The function will return the monarchs. Then, for the wars in England during the 18th century, the function might not directly provide wars, but the get_events function could be used.

A comparison between that number and the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition.\n3. The top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The user provided three functions: get_top_scorer, get_all_time_goals, and league_stats.get_top_scorer. \n\nFor the first part, the get_all_time_goals function seems appropriate. The parameters required are player_name, team_name, and competition. The user specified Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United, and Premier League. So I can call get_all_time_goals with these parameters.\n\nNext, the second part asks to compare the all-time goals of Ronaldo with the top scorer of Manchester United in the Premier League. To get the top scorer, I need to use get_top_scorer with team_name \"Manchester United\" and competition \"Premier League\". But wait, the get_top_scorer function's competition is optional, defaulting to Premier League. So even if it's not specified, it should work. However, the user might want the latest data, but the function's default is already Premier League. So calling get_top_scorer with team_name \"Manchester United\" should give the top scorer.\n\nThird, the third part is about the top scorer of the Premier League in 2019-2020. The league_stats.get_top_scorer function requires league_name and season. The user specified the season as 2019-2020, so I need to call league_stats.get_top_scorer with league_name \"Premier League\" and season \"2019-2020\".\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"Manchester United\" in the first part. The get_all_time_goals function's team_name is Manchester United, and the get_top_scorer for Manchester United. However, the get_top_scorer function's competition is optional, so if not specified, it defaults to Premier League. But the user wants the top scorer in the same competition (Premier League) as the first part. So the get_top_scorer for Manchester United with competition Premier League would be correct.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. get_all_time_goals with player_name \"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name \"Manchester United\", competition \"Premier League\".\n2. get_top_scorer with team_name \"Manchester United\", competition \"Premier League\".\n3. league_stats.get_top_scorer with league_name \"Premier League\", season \"2019-2020\".\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. The competition for the first function is specified, while the second function's competition is optional. The third function requires league_name and season. All parameters are provided as per the user's question."}

They want three things: the latest updates for Call of Duty on PlayStation Europe, the current price for Call of Duty on Xbox, and reviews for FIFA 21 from America.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The user provided three functions: update.find, reviews.find, and price.find. Each requires specific parameters. \n\nFor the first part, the latest updates for Call of Duty on PlayStation Europe. The function update.find takes game, platform, and region. So I'll call update.find with game=\"Call of Duty\", platform=\"Playstation\", region=\"European\".\n\nNext, the current price for Call of Duty on Xbox. The price.find function needs game and platform. So price.find(game=\"Call of Duty\", platform=\"Xbox\").\n\nThen, reviews for FIFA 21 from America. The reviews.find function requires game and region. So reviews.find(game=\"FIFA 21\", region=\"American\").\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly specified. The user mentioned the same game in two parts, so I'll use the same game name in all three calls. The regions are specified as European and American, which are valid parameters. The platforms are PlayStation and Xbox, which are valid as well. \n\nNo missing parameters here. All required fields are provided. So the three function calls should be made in order."}

They want a new restaurant serving chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce with max 500 calories. The restaurant_search function is suitable here. The ingredients are [\"chicken\", \"tomatoes\", \"lettuce\"], calories 500, and meal \"lunch\". But wait, the user mentioned \"new restaurant,\" so maybe the restaurant_search function can find that. However, the function doesn't specify how it finds restaurants, but the parameters are there.\n\nThen, dinner. They want a beef recipe replaced with tofu, under 600 calories. The ingredient_replace function is needed here. Original ingredient is \"beef\", replacement is \"tofu\", and calories 600. The meal is \"dinner\".\n\nI need to check if all parameters are provided. For recipe_search, all required parameters are there. For restaurant_search, the ingredients and calories are given. For ingredient_replace, the original and replacement are specified. So all functions can be called with the given parameters. No missing info here. So the tool calls should be made in order."}

The get_shortest_driving_distance function can calculate that. The unit parameter needs to be set to \"miles\" here.\n\nThen, the user wants who credited the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes the discovery as \"theory of relativity\" and returns the scientist.\n\nFinally, the retail price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish.

They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil medium, and red color. So I need to call the modify_painting function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant for 100 years using the Darwin model. The prediction.evolution function is available. The species is African elephant, years=100, model='Darwin'. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. They want the probability of a royal flush in a 52-card deck, with 4 possible outcomes. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Here, total_outcomes is 52 cards, favorable is 4. They want it rounded to 3 decimal places. So parameters are total_outcomes=52, favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set.

The user provided all these: area 2000, rooms 4, year 1985, location San Francisco. So I can call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The function lawsuit_search needs entity, county, and state. The entity is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. The default state is California, but since the user specified San Francisco county, maybe the state is California. So I'll use entity=\"Mr. John Doe\", county=\"San Francisco\", state=\"California\".\n\nLastly, the lottery probability. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user said total is 1000, favorable is 5, and round_to 3. So parameters are total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, round_to=3. The default for round_to is 2, but the user wants 3, so I need to specify that.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function again.

So game_name is 'Animal Crossing', season is 'Summer', item_type is 'fish'.\n\nSecond request: Highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function needs game, platform, region. Game is 'Fortnite', platform is 'Playstation', region is 'Asia'.\n\nThird request: Lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018.
