Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy.\n\nATP synthase is a large enzyme composed of two main parts: F0 and F1. The F0 portion spans the inner mitochondrial membrane and functions as a proton channel, while the F1 portion protrudes into the matrix and contains the catalytic site for ATP synthesis.\n\nThe process by which ATP is synthesized in mitochondria is known as oxidative phosphorylation, which is coupled with the electron transport chain. Here's a step-by-step overview:\n\n1. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC):** Electrons are passed through a series of protein complexes (Complex I, II, III, IV) embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons move through these complexes, protons (H+) are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient known as the proton motive force.\n\n2. **Proton Motive Force:** This gradient drives protons back into the matrix through ATP synthase. The flow of protons through ATP synthase provides the energy needed to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\n3. **ATP Synthesis:** In the F1 portion of ATP synthase, the proton flow causes a conformational change in the enzyme, which leads to the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP.\n\nTherefore, the primary function of ATP synthase in mitochondria is to harness the energy from the proton gradient to produce ATP, which is the cell's main energy currency.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Structure:** ATP synthase is a multi-subunit enzyme. The F0 sector includes several subunits that form the proton channel, while the F1 sector consists of subunits that facilitate ATP synthesis.\n\n- **Regulation:** The activity of ATP synthase is regulated by the proton gradient and the demand for ATP. When the cell has sufficient ATP, the synthase can operate in reverse, hydrolyzing ATP to pump protons back into the intermembrane space.\n\n- **Diseases:** Mutations in the genes encoding ATP synthase subunits can lead to various mitochondrial disorders, affecting tissues with high energy demands such as muscle and brain.\n\nUnderstanding the function of ATP synthase is crucial for grasping how cells produce energy and maintain their metabolic activities.", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"cell_biology.function_lookup": {"molecule": ["ATP synthase"], "organelle": ["mitochondria"], "specific_function": [true]}}]}

For the conditions, I need to specify two conditions: age > 25 and job = 'engineer'.

I have a function here called \"map_service.get_directions\" that seems perfect for this task. Let's see what parameters it needs.\n\nSo, the function \"map_service.get_directions\" requires a starting location and an ending location, both of which are strings, and it's mandatory to provide them. Additionally, there's an optional parameter called \"avoid,\" which is an array that lets me specify route features to avoid. By default, it avoids highways and ferries, but I can customize it.\n\nIn my case, I want to avoid highways and toll roads. Since avoiding highways is already the default, I just need to make sure that toll roads are included in the avoid list. But looking at the default avoid list, it's set to ['highways', 'ferries'], and toll roads aren't included by default. So, I need to specify that explicitly.\n\nWait a minute, the avoid parameter is an array, so I can pass multiple items in it. I should include both 'highways' and 'toll_roads' in the array to make sure the route avoids both.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm if 'toll_roads' is a valid option for the avoid parameter. I don't see it mentioned in the function description, but maybe it's a valid option. I should assume that it is, unless told otherwise.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the starting and ending locations are correctly specified. Starting location is New York, and ending location is Los Angeles. I should provide these as strings.\n\nLet me think about whether there are any other parameters I should consider. The function description doesn't mention any other parameters, so I think these are sufficient for my needs.\n\nOkay, so I'll call the \"map_service.get_directions\" function with the start set to \"New York\", end set to \"Los Angeles\", and avoid set to an array containing 'highways' and 'toll_roads'.\n\nI need to make sure that the avoid parameter is correctly formatted as an array in the function call.\n\nSo, in JSON format, it would look something like this:\n\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"function\": \"map_service.get_directions\",\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n\n      \"start\": \"New York\",\n\n      \"end\": \"Los Angeles\",\n\n      \"avoid\": [\"highways\", \"toll_roads\"]\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n\nWait, but I need to check if 'toll_roads' is a recognized option. If it's not, the function might ignore it or return an error. Assuming it's a valid option, I'll include it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just avoid tolls, and the function will handle it appropriately.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the function accepts partial addresses or if it requires more specific starting and ending points. Since it's a map service, it probably can handle city names, but for more precise directions, I might need to provide addresses.\n\nBut in this case, the user just provided city names, so I'll go with that.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other preferences, like preferring certain road types or modes of transportation. But the function doesn't seem to have parameters for that, so I'll stick with what's available.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to make the function call.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fulfill the user's request for directions from New York to Los Angeles while avoiding highways and toll roads, the `map_service.get_directions` function is appropriately suited. This function requires a starting location (`start`), an ending location (`end`), and optionally, features to avoid (`avoid`). Given that the default avoidance includes highways and ferries, additional specification is needed to avoid toll roads as per the user's preference.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Required Parameters**: The function requires `start` and `end` parameters, both strings representing locations.\n2. **Optional Parameters**: The `avoid` parameter is an array allowing specification of route features to avoid. Defaults are ['highways', 'ferries'], but toll roads need to be explicitly avoided.\n3. **Format the Function Call**: Structure the function call in JSON format, including the necessary parameters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"map_service.get_directions\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"start\": \"New York\",\n      \"end\": \"Los Angeles\",\n      \"avoid\": [\"highways\", \"toll_roads\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **start**: Set to \"New York\" as the starting location.\n- **end**: Set to \"Los Angeles\" as the destination.\n- **avoid**: Included both 'highways' and 'toll_roads' to meet the user's preference for avoiding these route features.\n\nThis function call will retrieve directions from New York to Los Angeles while ensuring that the route avoids highways and toll roads, aligning with the user's request.", "model_result_decoded": [{"map_service.get_directions": {"start": "New York", "end": "Los Angeles", "avoid": ["highways", "toll_roads"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"map_service.get_directions": {"start": ["New York", "NYC"], "end": ["Los Angeles", "LA"], "avoid": [["highways", "tolls"], ["tolls", "highways"]]}}]}

I have a function called \"concert_info.get\" that seems perfect for this task. It requires three parameters: location, date, and genre. So, I'll need to provide the city name, the time frame for the concerts, and the genre which is pop.\n\nFirst, the location is New York. That's straightforward. For the date, it says \"next month.\" I need to make sure that the date parameter is in a format that the function can understand. Maybe it expects a specific date format, like YYYY-MM-DD or something similar. I should check the function documentation for the expected date format.\n\nAssuming that the function can interpret \"next month\" as a time frame, I'll go with that. If not, I might need to calculate the dates manually. For example, if today is October 15, 2023, then next month would be November 2023. I might need to specify the start and end dates of November.\n\nThe genre is pop, which is clear.\n\nSo, the parameters would be:\n\n- location: New York\n\n- date: next month (or perhaps November 2023)\n\n- genre: pop\n\nI should also think about whether there are any other parameters that might be useful, like the number of results to return or any specific filters. But based on the function description, these are the required parameters.\n\nI need to make sure that the location is specified correctly. Is it New York City? Maybe I should specify it as NYC to make it clearer.\n\nAlso, for the date, if the function doesn't understand \"next month,\" I might need to input the start and end dates of November. For example, start_date: 2023-11-01 and end_date: 2023-11-30.\n\nWait, the parameter is just \"date,\" singular, so maybe it expects a single date or a date range in a specific format. I need to check the function documentation to see exactly what format is expected for the date parameter.\n\nAssuming that it accepts a string like \"next month\" or a date range like \"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30,\" I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, my function call would look like this:\n\n{\n\n  \"function\": \"concert_info.get\",\n\n  \"parameters\": {\n\n    \"location\": \"New York\",\n\n    \"date\": \"next month\",\n\n    \"genre\": \"pop\"\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nBut I should consider if \"next month\" is ambiguous. Maybe it's better to specify the month and year explicitly to avoid any confusion.\n\nAlternatively, if the function requires a specific date format, I should adjust accordingly.\n\nI think I'll proceed with specifying the date as \"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30\" to make it clear.\n\nSo, the parameters would be:\n\n- location: New York\n\n- date: \"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30\"\n\n- genre: pop\n\nThis should give me the pop concerts in New York for November 2023.\n\nI hope this is correct.
