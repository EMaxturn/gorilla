The user wants an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nFor uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be a street address with city, state. The user provided that exact address. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So that fits.\n\nThen there's uber.ride2. It also requires loc, type, and time. But the loc here is supposed to be 'City, State', but the user provided a full street address. However, uber.ride2's loc parameter description says it's the starting place location in 'City, State' format. The user's input is a street address, which might not fit. Also, uber.ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, so that's okay. But since the loc is a street address, maybe uber.ride is more appropriate because it accepts the full address.\n\nWait, the user's loc is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' which includes the street address, city, and state. The uber.ride function's loc parameter example is '123 Main St, San Francisco, CA', which matches the format. So uber.ride is the correct one here. The uber.ride2's loc requires just city and state, so the user's input doesn't fit that. Therefore, only uber.ride can be used here with the provided parameters."}

It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date.\n\nThe user provided all the necessary parameters: bank_name is U.S. Bank, account_number is 1-523-1713-5704, account_type is checking, full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction_overview details are total_deposits $7,132.76, total_withdrawals $5,927.40, start_date 2019-10-01, end_date 2019-10-31. The beginning and ending balances are given, but the BankStatementOverView doesn't require those, so maybe they are extra. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned including a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function might be needed for that. But the BankStatementOverView might already include a summary. Let me check the parameters again. The BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview includes totals but not individual transactions. The user wants a summary, which might require transaction_summary.generate, which takes transactions array, but the user hasn't provided individual transactions. Hmm, but the user hasn't given specific transactions, only totals. So maybe the BankStatementOverView is sufficient for the overview, and the transaction_summary can't be generated without the individual transactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the overview to include the totals they provided. So using BankStatementOverView with the given parameters would fulfill the request. The other functions like Alltransactions could retrieve transactions, but the user hasn't provided a statement period in the required format. Wait, the user specified October 2019, which would be '2019-10' for the statement_period parameter. But the user also provided dates as October 1 to 31, which is a month. So maybe Alltransactions with statement_period '2019-10' could get the transactions, but the user hasn't provided the necessary parameters for that function. However, the user hasn't given the parameters for Alltransactions, like include_pending. But the user's question is to provide an overview, which might not require retrieving transactions but using the provided totals. \n\nSo the main function to call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. The transaction_overview includes the totals, start and end dates. The beginning and ending balances are not part of the BankStatementOverView parameters, but the user provided them. However, the function doesn't require them, so maybe they are extra info. The user might need to use another function for the balance, but the question is about the overview, which the BankStatementOverView can handle. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the parameters provided."}

The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which probably maps to the price_range parameter. Looking at the enum options for price_range: cheap, moderate, pricey, ultra high-end. Intermediate might be 'moderate' since that's the default. Then, the user wants outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be set to true. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. The user just said New York, so maybe 'New York, NY'? The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it as default? Wait, no, the category is required. Wait, the parameters for FindRestaurants have 'category' as required. But the user didn't specify a cuisine type. Hmm, that's a problem. The required parameters are category and location. The user didn't mention a category, so maybe I need to ask for clarification? But the user's query doesn't include a category. Wait, the user just said \"some restaurants\" without specifying the type. But the function requires a category. So maybe the assistant should use a default category? But the function's parameters don't have a default for category. The enum list includes options like Mexican, Bistro, etc. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the assistant can't proceed without that info. Wait, but the user might not know the category. However, the function requires it. So in this case, the assistant might need to inform the user that a category is required. But the user hasn't provided that. However, the original instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating in New York. Since category is required, but not provided, the assistant should note that. But maybe the assistant can use a default? Wait, looking back at the function definition for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the parameters have 'category' as required, and there's no default mentioned. So the assistant can't proceed without that. Therefore, the correct response would be to point out that the category is missing. However, the user might not have specified it. But the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. So in this case, the assistant should respond that the category is required but not provided. However, the user's message says \"some restaurants\" without specifying the category. Therefore, the assistant can't call the function without that parameter. So the answer would be to indicate that the category is missing. But wait, maybe the user intended to leave it open, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a wildcard or a general category, but the enum doesn't have a general option. So the correct approach is to inform the user that the category is required. However, the user's instruction says that if parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. But the user hasn't provided that. However, the initial problem says that the assistant should make function calls if possible. But in this case, the required parameters are missing.

However, the problem says that the assistant should return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But how? The instructions say that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But the assistant is supposed to return the function calls. So perhaps the assistant can't make the call and must inform the user. However, the user's instruction says that the assistant should return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. If the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But how to do that? The problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out.

The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. The event_type can be specified as 'Music' and 'Theater' since the user wants both. Wait, but the enum for event_type only allows one of them. Hmm, the user said \"like concerts or plays,\" so maybe they want both types. But the function's event_type parameter is a single string with enum values Music or Theater. So I can't specify both. Maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each type. Alternatively, maybe the function allows multiple types, but according to the parameters, it's a single string. So perhaps the user's request can't be fully covered, but the best approach is to check both types. However, the function might not support multiple types. Let me check the parameters again. The event_type is a string with enum ['Music', 'Theater'], so only one can be selected per call. Therefore, I need to make two separate calls: one for Music and one for Theater. But the user might want both, so maybe the system will handle that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the parameters, it's a single string.

Let me structure the function calls accordingly. The first call for event_type 'Music' and the second for 'Theater', both with city 'Las Vegas' and date '2023-03-06'. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both types if the event_type is set to a different value, but according to the enum, it's only Music or Theater. So two separate calls are needed. But the user might not have specified the exact type, so maybe the function can be called with event_type as 'Music' and 'Theater' in separate calls. However, the system might not allow multiple function calls in one response. Wait, the user's instruction says to make one or more function calls. So I can make two function calls here. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters are event_type and city. The date is optional but the user specified March 6th, so include that. So the first function call would be Events_3_FindEvents with event_type 'Music', city 'Las Vegas', date '2023-03-06'. The second call would be the same but with event_type 'Theater'.

The description says the genre parameter uses 'dontcare' if not a criterion, but the enum includes 'dontcare' as an option. However, the user specified Hillbilly, which isn't in the enum. Hmm, that's a problem. The function's genre parameter has an enum with options like Country, but Hillbilly isn't there.

The description says \"the musical style or category. Use 'dontcare' if genre is not a filtering criterion.\" So maybe the user can input any string, but the enum shows the allowed options. If Hillbilly isn't in the enum, then passing it might not work. However, the user might have intended Country, which is in the enum. Alternatively, maybe the system is flexible. Let me check the enum again: the genre enum includes 'Country' and 'dontcare'. So Hillbilly isn't listed. That's an issue. But the user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" which might be a specific album. So perhaps the best approach is to use Music_3_LookupMusic with the album name and the year 2019, and maybe set genre to 'Country' as a close match, or leave genre as 'dontcare' if Hillbilly isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the user's mention of Hillbilly is just a style and the function can handle it as a free text. But according to the function's parameters, the genre is an enum, so only the listed options are allowed. Therefore, if Hillbilly isn't in the enum, the function can't use it. However, the user might not know the exact enum values. In that case, maybe the assistant should proceed with the available parameters. Let's proceed with the album \"Gotta Be Me\", year 2019, and genre as 'Country' (since Hillbilly is a sub-genre of Country). Alternatively, if the user insists on Hillbilly, but the function doesn't support it, maybe the assistant should note that. However, the user's main points are the album and the year. So perhaps the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with album \"Gotta Be Me\", year 2019, and genre as 'Country' (assuming that's the closest match). Then, once the songs are found, use Music_3_PlayMedia to play the track. But the user hasn't specified a particular track, just the album and style. So first, use LookupMusic to find songs that match the album and year, then play one of them. However, the user might want to play a track from that album. So the steps would be: 1. Use Music_3_LookupMusic with album \"Gotta Be Me\", year 2019, and maybe genre 'Country' (if applicable). 2. Once the songs are retrieved, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name, artist, and device. But the user hasn't provided the track name. So maybe the assistant needs to first look up the songs, then play one. However, the current turn is to make the function calls. Since the user hasn't specified a track, but wants to hear a song from that album, the assistant might need to first look up the songs and then play one. But in the current setup, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. Wait, the user's message is a single turn. The assistant can make multiple function calls in one turn. So first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with album \"Gotta Be Me\", year 2019, and genre 'Country' (if possible). Then, once the lookup returns the tracks, call Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name. However, the assistant doesn't have the track name yet. So maybe the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters to find the tracks, then use that information to play one. But in the current setup, the assistant can't know the result of the lookup. Therefore, the assistant should first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters provided by the user. The user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" and the year 2019. The genre is Hillbilly, but since that's not in the enum, maybe the assistant should use 'dontcare' for genre. Wait, the genre parameter's default is 'dontcare', so if the user wants Hillbilly, which isn't in the enum, perhaps the assistant should leave genre as 'dontcare' and rely on the album and year. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can input 'Hillbilly' as the genre even though it's not in the enum. The function's parameters for genre have an enum, but the type is string. The enum lists possible values, but maybe the function can accept other strings. However, the description says \"the musical style or category. Use 'dontcare' if genre is not a filtering criterion.\" So perhaps the assistant can input 'Hillbilly' as the genre even if it's not in the enum. The enum might just be a list of allowed options, but the function might still accept other values. However, the assistant should follow the parameters as defined. If the enum is strict, then 'Hillbilly' is not allowed. But the user might not know that. In this case, the assistant might proceed with the available parameters. So, the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic would be: album: \"Gotta Be Me\", year: \"2019\", genre: \"Hillbilly\" (even if not in enum), artist: \"dontcare\" (since the user didn't specify an artist). But the assistant should check if the parameters are valid. Since the genre's enum doesn't include Hillbilly, but the function's parameters allow a string, maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, the assistant might use 'Country' as the genre. However, the user specifically mentioned Hillbilly, so it's better to use that. The assistant should proceed with the given parameters, even if the enum doesn't include it, as the function might still accept it. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album \"Gotta Be Me\", year \"2019\", genre \"Hillbilly\", and artist \"dontcare\". Then, once the lookup returns the tracks, the assistant can call Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name, artist, and device. But since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant might need to play the first result or ask for clarification. However, the current task is to make the function calls based on the user's input. So the assistant should first call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters, then use the result to play a track. But in the current setup, the assistant can only make the initial call. Therefore, the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters provided."}

The user provided the restaurant name as Balthazar, location as New York, time as 8 PM, date as this Friday, and number of seats as four.\n\nI need to format the time in 24-hour format. 8 PM is 20:00. The date should be in ISO format. This Friday's date depends on the current date, but since the example uses '2021-08-15', maybe the system expects a placeholder. However, the user didn't specify the exact date, so I should use the relative term 'this Friday' as the date parameter. Wait, but the function requires a specific date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. If the current date isn't provided, maybe the function expects the user to input the actual date. However, the user said \"this Friday,\" which might need conversion. But since the assistant can't compute dates, perhaps the parameter should be set to 'this Friday' as a string, but that's not ISO format. Hmm, this might be an issue. The function requires a specific date, but the user provided a relative date. However, the example in the function's parameters shows '2021-08-15', so maybe the user is expected to input the actual date. But the user hasn't provided it. Wait, the user said \"this Friday,\" so maybe the assistant should use that as the date parameter, even though it's not in ISO format. But that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle relative dates, but according to the function's description, the date must be in ISO format.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant should note that the date is missing, but the user did mention \"this Friday,\" so perhaps the assistant should use that as the date parameter, even if it's not ISO. Wait, but the function requires a specific date. This is a problem. However, the user might not know the exact date, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the information given, using 'this Friday' as the date. But the function's parameters require a string in ISO format. This is conflicting. Maybe the assistant should proceed with the best possible information, even if it's not perfect. So, the date would be 'this Friday' as a string, even though it's not ISO. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should calculate the actual date. But since the current date isn't provided, the assistant can't do that. Therefore, the function call might have an incorrect date parameter, but that's the best the assistant can do. Alternatively, the user might have intended to provide the date in the correct format, but they said \"this Friday,\" so the assistant should use that as the date parameter. \n\nSo, the parameters would be: restaurant_name: 'Balthazar', location: 'New York, NY' (since the format is 'City, State'), time: '20:00', date: 'this Friday', number_of_seats: 4. Wait, but the date needs to be in ISO format. If the user says \"this Friday,\" but the function requires a specific date, maybe the assistant should use the relative term as a placeholder. However, the function might not accept that. This is a problem. But the user hasn't provided the exact date, so the assistant can't proceed without it. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the relative term. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed with the given information, even if the date isn't in the correct format. \n\nIn the example given in the function's parameters, the date is '2021-08-15', so the assistant should use that format. But the user hasn't provided the exact date. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask for clarification, but according to the instructions, the assistant should make the function call with the available information. So, the assistant will use 'this Friday' as the date parameter, even though it's not in ISO format. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the current date plus 5 days, but without knowing the current date, that's impossible. Therefore, the assistant proceeds with the given information, even if the date is not in the correct format. \n\nSo, the function call would be:\n\nReserveRestaurant with parameters:\nrestaurant_name: 'Balthazar'\nlocation: 'New York, NY'\ntime: '20:00'\ndate: 'this Friday'\nnumber_of_seats: 4\n\nBut the date parameter is supposed to be in ISO format.

The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned a global application alert, the create_global_application_alert_config is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for that function: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The name is given. The alert_type should be 'error_rate' as per the enum. The threshold is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. The recipients are the two emails provided. The enabled parameter has a default of True, so unless the user specifies it shouldn't be enabled, we can leave it as default. The user didn't mention disabling it, so include enabled: True.\n\nWait, the parameters required are name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The enabled is not required, so it's optional. So in the function call, I need to include name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The threshold is a float, so 5% is 0.05. The recipients are an array of strings.

The first one requires a user_id and an include_revoked flag. The user provided the user ID, so that's covered. The second function doesn't require any parameters, but it has options like include_expired, page, and page_size. \n\nWait, the user said \"ALL API TOKENS\", so maybe they want every token, including expired or revoked ones. The first function's include_revoked parameter defaults to False, but the user might need to set that to True to get revoked tokens. However, the second function has include_expired, which would cover expired tokens. But the user didn't mention anything about expiration, just that they want all tokens. \n\nBut the user ID is provided, so the first function is more specific to the user's account. The second function might not take a user ID, so maybe it's a more general list. Wait, looking at the parameters for api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, there's no user_id parameter. That's a problem because the user is specifying their user ID. The first function requires user_id, so that's the one to use here. \n\nSo, using CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to True to ensure all tokens, including revoked ones, are retrieved. The user might not know about revoked tokens, so including them makes sense. The default for include_revoked is False, so setting it to True would cover all tokens. \n\nAlternatively, if the user wants all tokens regardless of revocation status, that's the way to go. The other function doesn't take a user_id, so it might not be the right one here. So the correct function call is get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked=True."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe functions available are set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for an alarm at a specific time, set_alarm is the right choice. The set_countdown is for a duration, which doesn't fit here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for set_alarm, the required parameter is alarm_time. The user specified \"7:00 AM\" and the date is tomorrow, which is 2023-12-01. So the alarm_time should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or a time with AM/PM. Since the user mentioned the date, I should include it. So the time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. Alternatively, since the function accepts 'HH:MM AM/PM' with the date, maybe '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' is also acceptable. But the example given in the function's parameters includes '9:30 AM' without the date, so maybe the date is optional. Wait, the description says the time can be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format, which includes the date. Since the user specified the date, I should include it to ensure the alarm is set for the correct day. \n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, defaulting to 'reminder'. The user mentioned the purpose is for a meeting, so maybe adding the purpose as 'meeting' would be better. But the default is 'reminder', which is acceptable. However, the user said \"wake up early for a meeting\", so maybe specifying the purpose as 'meeting' is more precise. \n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'meeting'. Alternatively, using '7:00 AM' with the date. Let me check the examples again. The examples include '2023-06-01 09:30:00', '14:45', '9:30 AM'. So the date can be included in the format. Therefore, the correct alarm_time is '2023-12-01 07:00:00' or '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. Both should be acceptable. However, the function's parameters mention that the time can be in 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM' formats, or with AM/PM. So using '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' might be better as it includes the date and the AM/PM format. But the example uses '2023-06-01 09:30:00' which is 24-hour format. Maybe the function expects the time in 24-hour format when a date is included. Wait, the description says the time can be in various formats, including 'HH:MM:SS' (24-hour) or 'HH:MM AM/PM' (12-hour). So if the user specifies the date, the time part can be in either format. So '2023-12-01 07:00:00' is 24-hour, or '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' is 12-hour. Both are acceptable. \n\nThe user wrote \"7:00 AM\", so using the 12-hour format with AM/PM is appropriate here. Therefore, the alarm_time parameter should be '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. The purpose is 'meeting' as per the user's request. \n\nSo the function call is set_alarm with alarm_time '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' and purpose 'meeting'."}
