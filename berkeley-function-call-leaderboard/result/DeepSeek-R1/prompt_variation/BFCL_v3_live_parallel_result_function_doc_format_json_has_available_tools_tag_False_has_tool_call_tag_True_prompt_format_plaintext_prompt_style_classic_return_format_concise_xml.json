We need to log each food item separately.\n The available function is 'log_food'. It requires:\n   - food_name (string)\n   - portion_amount (float)\n   - portion_unit (string, from enum: ['cup', 'grams', 'slice', 'piece', 'tablespoon'])\n   - meal_type (string, from enum: ['breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'snack'], default: 'snack')\n   - log_date (string, ISO 8601 format, default: None) -> but we don't have a specific date, so we can omit and the default (None) will be used.\n\n The user described two different eating occasions: \n   1. \"I had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea.\" -> This is the current snack? \n   2. \"Earlier I had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\" -> This was earlier, but we don't have a specific time.\n\n However, note that the function has a default for meal_type as 'snack'. We don't have information about the meal type for each, so we can use the default.\n\n But the user mentioned two separate times: \"earlier\" and the first one (which is now). We don't have a timestamp for either.\n\n Since we don't have a specific date and time, we can leave the log_date as default (None) for both. The system might then use the current time for the log.\n\n However, note the description: the first food is the current one and the second is earlier. But without a timestamp, we cannot set the time for the earlier one.\n\n Since the function doesn't require log_date (it's optional and defaults to None), and we don't have an exact time for \"earlier\", we will log without specifying the time.\n\n Steps:\n   We'll break down the user's input into individual food items:\n\n   First part (current):\n      - 8 pieces of frozen mango -> food_name: \"frozen mango\", portion_amount: 8, portion_unit: \"piece\"\n      - a chai tea -> This is a drink. How to log? The function is for food. But the description says \"food item\", so we can log it as a food? \n          However, note: the function is called 'log_food'. We don't have a separate function for drinks. We can log it as a food? \n          The user might consider it as a beverage. We can use portion_unit: \"cup\" or \"piece\"? \n          The user said \"a chai tea\", meaning one serving. We don't have a unit for \"serving\", but we can use \"cup\" or just \"piece\". \n          Since the function enum doesn't have \"serving\", we can use \"piece\" for simplicity? But note the enum: ['cup', 'grams', 'slice', 'piece', 'tablespoon']\n          Alternatively, if we know the typical unit for tea, we might use \"cup\". Let's assume a chai tea is one cup? Or if it's a bottle, then we don't know. \n          Since the user didn't specify, we can log as:\n             food_name: \"chai tea\", portion_amount: 1, portion_unit: \"cup\"\n\n   Second part (earlier):\n      - two slices of pepperoni pizza -> food_name: \"pepperoni pizza\", portion_amount: 2, portion_unit: \"slice\"\n      - a coffee -> similarly, we can log as: food_name: \"coffee\", portion_amount: 1, portion_unit: \"cup\"\n\n But note: the function allows only one food item per call. We need to make four separate calls.\n\n However, the problem: the earlier foods should be logged with a different time? But we don't have a timestamp for \"earlier\". We cannot set the log_date because we don't know the exact time.\n\n Since we don't have the exact time, we will log without the log_date parameter (so it uses the current time for both). This might be inaccurate for the earlier meal.\n\n But the user might be logging the earlier meal at the same time as the current one? That is, they are entering both at once. So the system will assign the current time to both.\n\n Alternatively, if the user expects the earlier meal to be logged in the past, we would need a timestamp. But the user didn't provide one.\n\n We'll log without the log_date for all.\n\n Also, note that the user didn't specify the meal type. We'll use the default ('snack') for all.\n\n Therefore, we'll make four function calls:\n\n  1. frozen mango: \n        food_name: \"frozen mango\", portion_amount: 8.0, portion_unit: \"piece\", meal_type: \"snack\"\n\n  2. chai tea:\n        food_name: \"chai tea\", portion_amount: 1.0, portion_unit: \"cup\", meal_type: \"snack\"\n\n  3. pepperoni pizza:\n        food_name: \"pepperoni pizza\", portion_amount: 2.0, portion_unit: \"slice\", meal_type: \"snack\"\n\n  4. coffee:\n        food_name: \"coffee\", portion_amount: 1.0, portion_unit: \"cup\", meal_type: \"snack\"\n\n But wait, the user might consider the pizza as a meal (like lunch) and the current mango and tea as a snack? \n However, the user didn't specify. We are using the default. We could ask, but the instruction says: if the question lacks parameters, point it out? \n But the function doesn't require meal_type (it has a default). So we can proceed.\n\n However, note: the user said \"earlier\" for the pizza and coffee. We don't know if that was breakfast, lunch, or dinner. \n Since we don't have enough information, we use the default.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the meal_type for the pizza and coffee to a different type? But without user input, we cannot.\n\n We'll log all as snacks. \n\n If the user wants to correct, they can adjust later.\n\n So we will generate four <function> calls within one <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n Important: The function name is 'log_food'. We must use the exact name.\n\n Let's write the XML-like structure:"}
