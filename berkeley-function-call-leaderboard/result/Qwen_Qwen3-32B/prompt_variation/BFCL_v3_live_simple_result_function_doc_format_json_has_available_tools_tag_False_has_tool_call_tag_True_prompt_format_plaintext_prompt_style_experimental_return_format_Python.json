They mentioned \"today,\" so I need to set movie_date to today's date. The system note says to default to the current date in India. Since the user didn't specify a date format, but the function requires 'YYYY-MM-DD', I should format today's date accordingly. Let me check today's date in India. Assuming today is 2023-10-05, but I should actually get the current date. Wait, as an AI, I don't have real-time data, but the function's default for movie_date is None, which probably means it uses the current date. However, the user explicitly said \"today,\" so maybe I should set movie_date to today's date. But the function's default is already the current date, so maybe it's optional. However, the system note says to consider the current date in India. So perhaps I should explicitly set movie_date to today's date in India. Let me confirm the current date. Let's say today is 2023-10-05. So the parameter would be movie_date='2023-10-05'. \n\nThe user didn't mention cinema hall, language, or format, so those can be left as default. The function's default for movie_format is '2D', which is fine. So the function call should include city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date. Wait, but the function's movie_date parameter has a default of None, which might mean it uses the current date. But the user wants today's date, so maybe it's better to explicitly pass it. However, if the default is already the current date, passing it explicitly might not be necessary. But the system note says to default to the current date in India. So perhaps the function's default is set to that, but to be safe, I should include the movie_date as today's date. Since I can't compute the current date, maybe the function expects the user to pass it. But the user is asking for today, so I need to make sure the date is correct. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Since the function's default is None, but the system note says to use the current date in India, maybe the function internally handles that. Therefore, I can just pass the city as Mumbai and rely on the function to use the current date. But the user might be in a different timezone. Wait, the system note says to consider the current date in India. So regardless of the user's location, the date is based on India. Therefore, the function call should have city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date in India. But since I can't get the current date, perhaps the function expects the default to be used. The function's parameters have a default of None for movie_date, so maybe the backend will handle it. Therefore, the correct call is get_movies with city='Mumbai' and other parameters as default. But the user specified \"today,\" so maybe it's better to include the date. However, without knowing the actual current date, I can't fill it in. Wait, the function's default is the current date, so if I don't specify it, it will use that. Therefore, the correct function call is get_movies(city='Mumbai'). The other parameters are optional and can be left as default. So the final answer is to call get_movies with city Mumbai."}
