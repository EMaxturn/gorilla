They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the Caesar salad, the ChaFod function seems appropriate. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"without anchovies,\" so I should put anchovies in removeIngredients. The foodItem is Caesar salad. No new ingredients mentioned, so that can be omitted. Special instructions might not be needed here unless there's more, but the user only mentioned removing anchovies.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new preferences include size (large), type (hot coffee), sweetness (regular), and milk (almond). I need to structure these into a dictionary for new_preferences. The parameters are required, so I must include them. \n\nWait, the drink function's new_preferences is a dict. So I should format that correctly. The user said \"large hot coffee\" \u2013 does that mean the size is large and the type is hot coffee? Or is \"large hot coffee\" the entire type? Probably, size is \"large\", type is \"hot coffee\". Then sweetness is \"regular\" and milk is \"almond\". So the new_preferences would be {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\"}.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly mapped. Also, check if any parameters are missing. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, which is provided. For the drink, drink_id is 123, and new_preferences is the dict with those keys. \n\nNo issues with missing parameters. So two function calls: one for the food and one for the drink."}

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is the right choice here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. Since the destination isn't specified, it will clone to the current directory by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo's contents to determine the main language. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory name. Assuming the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be the repo's root, maybe \"nodejs-welcome\". But since the user didn't specify a subdirectory, I'll use the default, which might be the current directory. Wait, the function's parameter is required, so I need to provide a directory name. Let's assume the repo is cloned into a directory named \"nodejs-welcome\". So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nOnce the analysis is done, the next step is to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name. Again, using \"nodejs-welcome\" as the directory where the Dockerfile should be created.\n\nThen, generate Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory name. Since the user didn't specify other parameters like deployment name, image name, etc., I'll use defaults. The directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\". The other parameters can be omitted, so the function will use defaults. But maybe the image name should be based on the analysis. Wait, the analysis might indicate the language is Node.js, so the image name could be something like \"nodejs-welcome:latest\". But since the function's image_name parameter is optional and defaults to \"latest\", perhaps it's handled. I'll proceed with just the directory_name.\n\nAfter modifying files, need to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function will handle adding, committing, and pushing. The directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\". The commit message and branch name aren't specified, so I'll use default values. The commit message could be \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\", but since it's optional, maybe the user expects a generic message. Alternatively, the function might handle the add and commit with a default message. The branch name is not given, so it might default to the current branch, like main. Force push is optional and defaults to false.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyze the repo's directory.\n3. Create Dockerfile.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs.\n5. Push changes.\n\nEach step requires a function call. The parameters need to be correctly set. Let me make sure all required parameters are included. For example, analyse_repo_contents and create_a_docker_file both require directory_name. Assuming the repo is cloned into \"nodejs-welcome\", that's the directory to use. The Kubernetes function also needs directory_name, which is the same. The push function needs the directory name again. All required parameters are present. The other parameters for Kubernetes can be omitted as they have defaults. So the function calls should be in order: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github."}

They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. So, I should use the 'get_relevant_classes' function with the search string 'CellResult' and set 'include_subdirectories' to true.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to check their overrides. For that, I'll use the 'get_signature' function twice, once for each method. The class name is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. I should make sure to specify the correct parameters. Since the user didn't mention private methods, I can omit the 'include_private' parameter or set it to false.\n\nWait, the 'get_relevant_classes' function's 'include_subdirectories' is a boolean required false, so I need to set that to true.
