The parameters required are initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. The rounding is optional, default is 2, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless they want a different decimal place.

The user specified the game title, platform, and region, so all required parameters are provided. The region is set to United States, which is the default for some functions, but here it's explicitly mentioned. \n\nI should call video_games.store_price with game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', and region='United States'.

The user is asking for the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the kinematic equations. Since it's starting from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance and time, and we need to find the final speed. But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Do they want the final speed at the end of the 4 seconds, or the average speed during the 4 seconds? The wording says \"how fast an object was going\", which usually refers to instantaneous speed at the end. But let me check the functions available.\n\nLooking at the functions provided: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). So maybe this function can be used here. Let me check the parameters. The user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial_speed is 0 since it starts from rest. So the function calculate_speed_from_rest requires distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user's inputs fit into these parameters. So I can call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. Wait, but initial_speed is default 0, so maybe it's optional. But since the problem states it starts from rest, including it makes sense. However, the function's parameters specify that distance and time are required, and initial_speed is optional with default 0. So in this case, since initial_speed is 0, we can omit it. Therefore, the function call would be calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm what exactly the function calculates. If it's using the equation for final velocity when starting from rest, the formula would be v = 2d/t, but that's only if the acceleration is constant. Wait, no, the standard kinematic equation for distance under constant acceleration starting from rest is d = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2. Then, final velocity v = a * t. So combining these, v = (2d)/t. So if the function calculate_speed_from_rest uses this formula, then the result would be (2*20)/4 = 10 m/s. But I need to make sure that the function is indeed using that formula. The function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a specified distance. So I think that's the case. Therefore, using this function should give the correct final speed. So the correct function call is to use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's the default, we don't need to include it. So the parameters are distance and time. Therefore, the tool call should be to that function with those parameters."}

Hmm, I remember that when gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the quantities.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check its parameters. It requires quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The user provided exactly those values: quantity1 is 2 moles, temperature1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temperature2 is 400 K. So I can directly use this function. I don't need to calculate mass here because the problem doesn't mention molar mass or require mass calculation. The answer should be the weighted average temperature based on the moles.

The parameters are elements (the list) and order (default 'asc'). Since the user specified ascending, I don't need to change the default. So I should call sort_list with the elements parameter set to the list of names and order as 'asc' or just rely on the default. But to be explicit, maybe include order='asc' anyway. \n\nWait, the function's order parameter has a default of 'asc', so even if I don't specify it, it should work. But the user explicitly said \"ascending order\", so including it might be better for clarity. Either way, the function should handle it. \n\nSo the correct function call would be sort_list with elements ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order 'asc'. The other functions, filter_list and sum_elements, don't apply here because we're not filtering or summing. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted.

The function requires desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The default for n_rolls is 1, but wait, the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. Oh, wait, no, maybe n_rolls is the number of times you roll the dice, but in this case, they're rolling two dice at once. Wait, the function's description says \"number of dice to be rolled\". Oh right, so n_rolls is the number of dice. So for two dice, n_rolls is 2. The desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die is probably 6 since it's standard dice. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Let me make sure. The default for sides_per_die is not specified in the function's args, wait, looking back: the function's args list sides_per_die as an arg with a default? Wait the function's args are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int, default 1), sides_per_die (int). Wait, the default for sides_per_die isn't mentioned. Wait the function definition says: Args: desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int): Number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1. sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die. So sides_per_die doesn't have a default. Wait, so the user must provide it. But the user's question is about standard dice, which have 6 sides. So I need to set sides_per_die=6. So the function call should be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. That should calculate the probability correctly. Let me confirm how many combinations there are. For two 6-sided dice, there are 6*6=36 possible outcomes. The combinations that sum to 7 are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) which is 6 combinations. So the probability is 6/36 = 1/6. So the function should return that. Therefore, the correct function call is to use dice_roll_probability with those parameters."}

The month is upcoming, so maybe the default value for the month parameter in the function can handle that.\n\nSo, I should call find_exhibition with location set to \"New York\", art_form as \"modern sculpture\", month as the default (which might be upcoming), and user_ratings set to \"high\" as the default. Wait, the user wants the top-rated, so maybe setting user_ratings to a higher threshold like 'high' makes sense. The function's default for user_ratings is 'high', so maybe even if we don't specify it, it's already set. But to be safe, maybe include it explicitly.\n\nWait, the parameters for find_exhibition are location (required), art_form (required), month (optional, default is upcoming), and user_ratings (optional, default is 'high').

The user says \"upcoming month\", so maybe setting month to the current upcoming month's name, but the user just says \"upcoming\", so perhaps the default is sufficient. \n\nIn any case, the function's month parameter can take a month name or default to upcoming. Since the user says \"upcoming month\", using the default might be okay. But to be precise, maybe the month should be the next month's name. However, without knowing the current date, the function might handle \"upcoming\" as a keyword.
