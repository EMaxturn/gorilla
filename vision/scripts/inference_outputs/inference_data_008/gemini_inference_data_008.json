I've successfully identified her as the athlete and the event. Now, I'm formulating search queries to pinpoint her precise ranking. I plan to use search strings like \"Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn Paris 2024 Olympics results\" and \"Women's breaking results Paris 2024 Olympics\" to uncover her final placement. Locating Official Rankings I'm currently focused on the final phase of this process: pinpointing the exact final rank. My preliminary research suggests Rachael Gunn finished last in her group. I've re-run the search using queries like \"women's breaking Paris 2024 final standings\" and \"Paris 2024 breaking B-Girl round robin results\". The goal is to get a specific numerical ranking from official sources to confirm my initial deductions. Ascertaining Final Ranking I've determined Raygun competed in the Paris 2024 breaking event and was eliminated in the first round with no points scored. Initial analysis suggests a 15th-place finish, as someone was disqualified. To solidify this, I'm now seeking further confirmation by investigating Olympic results focusing on disqualifications and final standings. Pinpointing the Athlete's Rank I've determined that Rachael Gunn, despite not being listed in the official top 15, must be ranked 16th. This is because the competition comprised 16 athletes in the main round. The 15th-ranked athlete is explicitly listed, and Rachael's absence implies she placed below them. The disqualified athlete, Manizha Talash, would be placed last at 17th. Therefore, I can confidently conclude Rachael Gunn's final rank as 16th."

My plan is to use terms like \"Australian female breaker,\" \"Paris 2024 breaking results,\" and specific names that might be a match. Seeking Official Results I've determined Rachael Gunn, also known as Raygun, competed in the breaking event's Olympic debut at Paris 2024. Search results agree she lost all battles without scoring. However, I need official standings to pinpoint her exact final rank, given another competitor's disqualification. I'm now focusing on finding those official results. Finding Rachael's Rank I've located the final standing section on the Wikipedia page for the event. Per the final results, Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn placed 15th overall, matching her pre-seeding. Her elimination in the group stage determined her final position in the competition. Confirming Olympic Results I've confirmed that Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn, representing Australia in the breaking event at the Paris 2024 Olympics, did not advance past the group stage. My searches show she scored zero points. Further investigation confirms Manizha Talash as one of the remaining competitors. I'm focusing on the specifics of the group stage now."
