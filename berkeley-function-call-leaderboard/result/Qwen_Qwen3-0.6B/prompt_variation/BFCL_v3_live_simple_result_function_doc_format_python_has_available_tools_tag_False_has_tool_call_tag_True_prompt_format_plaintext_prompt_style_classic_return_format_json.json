The only function provided is requests.get. The parameters required for this function are url and params. \n\nThe URL endpoint given in the question is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

The function's URL includes 'interfaceInfo' which probably refers to the interface statistics. \n\nWait, the function's URL has placeholders like {ip}, which the user provided. So maybe the function can be called with the given IP, but the parameters like node ID, pod, fabric need to be included. However, the function's parameters don't have these fields. \n\nSince the function requires the URL and params, but the user hasn't provided the actual parameters (like node ID, pod, fabric), I can't call the function without those.

However, the user's question includes all the necessary parameters except the ones in the function's parameters. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are url and params. The user's question includes the URL as 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo' and the IP. But the parameters for the function require the URL and query parameters.

However, the user's question includes all the necessary parameters except the ones in the function's parameters. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the user's question. The user says: \"retrieve the Ethernet interface statistics from the node with ID 12 in pod 10 of the Network1 fabric, using the IP 192.120.45.67\". \n\nSo the parameters required are: node ID, pod, fabric.

However, the user's question includes all the necessary parameters except the ones in the function's parameters. \n\nWait, perhaps the function's parameters are not required.
