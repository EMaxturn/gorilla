However, in the list, the name is exactly that. So we use the full name.\n\n Format:\n [ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\"})]\n\n But note: the parameters for ChaFod have default values for newIngredients and specialInstructions. We can omit them if they are default (empty string). However, the function expects the parameters by name. We can set only the ones we need? Actually, the function definition says the parameters are required? Let me check:\n\n For ChaFod:\n   required: ['foodItem'] -> so only foodItem is required. The others are optional and have defaults.\n\n Similarly, for ChaDri.change_drink:\n   required: ['drink_id', 'new_preferences'] -> so we must provide both.\n\n In the new_preferences, the properties have default values. We are providing all the ones that are non-default? But note: the function expects a dictionary for new_preferences with the properties. We are providing:\n   size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type -> and we leave out special_instructions? But the default for special_instructions is an empty string. We can set it to an empty string or omit it? However, the function expects a dictionary that may have the keys. Since the function definition in the parameters for new_preferences is a dict with properties, and the properties have defaults, we can only set the ones we want? Actually, the function expects a dictionary that includes all the keys? But the description says \"the updated preferences\", so we are replacing the entire preferences with the new one. Therefore, we should set all the keys that are defined in the properties? \n\n However, note the function description: \"The updated preferences for the drink order.\" and it is a dictionary. The properties of the dictionary are the keys we can set. But the function does not require every key? Because they have defaults. So we can set only the ones we wish to change? Actually, the function is replacing the entire preferences. So if we don't set a key, it will use the default? But that might reset the other preferences. \n\n Since the customer is updating only the specified attributes and we don't know the previous state of the other attributes, we must set only the ones we are updating? But wait, the function is designed to update the entire preferences. Therefore, we must set all the attributes that the customer wants to have in the new order? However, the customer did not mention some attributes (like special_instructions). We don't want to change the existing special_instructions? But the function doesn't take the previous state. Therefore, we must set all the attributes that are part of the preferences? \n\n Alternatively, the function might be designed to merge the new preferences? The description doesn't say. Since it says \"modifies the existing drink order\", it might be that the function is designed to update only the provided fields? But the parameters for the function are defined as a dictionary for the entire preferences. \n\n Looking at the parameters for ChaDri.change_drink: \n   new_preferences: The updated preferences for the drink order.\n\n This implies that we are replacing the entire preferences. Therefore, we must set every field that we want to have in the drink. But note: the customer only specified:\n   size: large\n   temperature: hot\n   sweetness_level: regular\n   milk_type: almond\n\n We don't know what the previous special_instructions were. The function does not allow partial update? The problem is that the function does not have a way to only update specific fields. Therefore, we must set the entire set of preferences? But we don't have the previous state of the preferences. \n\n How can we solve? We don't have a function to get the current drink order. Therefore, we have to assume that the customer wants to set the drink to exactly the preferences they are stating? And the defaults for the other fields? \n\n However, the customer did not mention the other fields. So we set the ones they mentioned and use the defaults for the others? But note: the defaults in the function are:\n   size: 'medium' -> but we are setting to large, so that's fine.\n   temperature: 'cold' -> but we set to hot.\n   sweetness_level: 'regular' -> we set to regular (same as default, but we set it anyway).\n   milk_type: 'regular' -> we set to almond.\n   special_instructions: default is empty string.\n\n But what if the drink had a special instruction before? We are replacing it with empty? That might not be what the customer wants. However, the customer did not mention it, so we are removing any previous special instruction? That might be acceptable because the customer is making a change and they are only specifying these attributes. But the function does not allow partial update. Therefore, we have to do it this way.\n\n Alternatively, the system might be designed so that the previous state is stored and we only update the provided fields? But the function signature does not suggest that. The function requires a dictionary for the entire new preferences.\n\n Since we don't have a way to retrieve the current state, we must set the entire preferences to the new values, using the defaults for any field not mentioned? But the customer did not mention the special_instructions, so we set it to the default (empty string). \n\n Therefore, we will set:\n   size: \"large\"\n   temperature: \"hot\"\n   sweetness_level: \"regular\"\n   milk_type: \"almond\"\n   special_instructions: \"\"   (because the customer didn't specify any)\n\n So the dictionary for new_preferences is:\n   {\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"temperature\": \"hot\",\n        \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\",\n        \"milk_type\": \"almond\",\n        \"special_instructions\": \"\"\n   }\n\n But note: the function definition for new_preferences has an enum for each field? We are using the allowed values.\n\n Alternatively, we can omit special_instructions? But the function expects a dictionary that has the properties. The function does not require every property? Because they have defaults. So we can set only the ones we want? Actually, the function definition for the parameters of the tool call is that new_preferences is a dictionary. The properties of that dictionary are defined, but the function does not require every key? The description says: \"The updated preferences for the drink order.\" and it is a dictionary. So we can pass a dictionary with only the keys we wish to update? But then what happens to the other keys? They would be left as the previous state? The function description doesn't specify.\n\n However, looking at the function definition in the provided JSON, the parameters for the function are defined as a dict with properties. This is for the tool call, meaning that when we call the function, we must pass a dictionary that conforms to that schema? But the schema has required properties? Actually, the properties of the new_preferences dictionary are not individually required? Only the top-level parameters (drink_id and new_preferences) are required.\n\n The schema for new_preferences is a dict with properties, but the properties themselves are not required? They have defaults. So we can pass a dictionary that only has the keys we wish to set? And the function would merge it with the existing preferences? Or would it replace the entire preferences? The description does not specify.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since we don't have a way to get the current state, we must assume that the function expects the entire set of preferences? But the customer only provided a subset. Therefore, we have two options:\n\n Option 1: Only set the provided fields and hope the function does a merge? But we don't know if that's the case.\n\n Option 2: Set the entire set of preferences, using the defaults for the ones not provided? That would reset any existing special instructions.\n\n The problem is that the customer did not mention the special instructions, so we don't know if they want to keep the previous one or not. But note: the customer is making a change and they are only updating the attributes they mentioned. So it is safe to reset the other attributes to default? Not necessarily.\n\n However, without more information, and because the function is designed to update the entire preferences, we must do as the function requires. We have to pass a complete set? But the function doesn't require every key in the dictionary? Only the top-level dictionary is required. And the properties of the dictionary are optional? \n\n Looking at the schema for new_preferences:\n   properties: ... (each property has a default)\n\n So the dictionary can have any subset of the keys? Then we can pass only the keys that we are updating? And the function will update only those fields? That would be the ideal design. \n\n How do we know? The function description says: \"Modifies the existing drink order to accommodate the customer's new request\". It doesn't say it replaces the entire preferences. So it's more likely that it does a partial update.\n\n Therefore, we will pass only the keys that the customer provided? But note: the customer didn't provide special_instructions, so we don't pass it? Then the function would leave the existing special_instructions unchanged? That is what we want.\n\n So the dictionary for new_preferences should be:\n   {\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"temperature\": \"hot\",\n        \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\",\n        \"milk_type\": \"almond\"\n   }\n\n We omit special_instructions because the customer didn't mention it and we don't want to change it.\n\n But wait, the function definition for the new_preferences dictionary in the tool call does not require any of the keys? So it's valid to pass a dictionary with only some of the keys.\n\n Therefore, we will do:\n\n Function 1: ChaFod for the salad.\n   foodItem: \"Caesar salad\"\n   removeIngredients: \"anchovies\"\n\n Function 2: ChaDri.change_drink for the drink.\n   drink_id: \"123\"\n   new_preferences: {\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"temperature\": \"hot\",\n        \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\",\n        \"milk_type\": \"almond\"\n   }\n\n We'll write the function calls accordingly.\n\n Format: [ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\"})]\n\n But note: in the function call, we are using double quotes for the string values. However, the format of the function call in the response should be a string. We must follow the exact format as in the example: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\n We can write the dictionary in the new_preferences as a JSON-like object? But note the instruction says: \"in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...)]\". The values can be strings, numbers, booleans, or even objects? \n\n The example in the instruction includes a function call with a dictionary: \n   func_name2(params) \n and in our case, one of the parameters is a dictionary.\n\n How to represent the dictionary? We can use Python-like syntax? The original function definitions are in Python 3 syntax.\n\n So we write the dictionary as a Python dict.\n\n However, in the response, we must not include any other text. So we write:\n\n [ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\"), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\"})]\n\n But note: the function name for the drink is \"ChaDri.change_drink\", which includes a dot. That is acceptable because that's the exact name given.\n\n Alternatively, the tool might expect the function name without the module? But the given function name is exactly \"ChaDri.change_drink\". So we use that.\n\n Let me write the function calls accordingly."}

Latest news report for Paris, France, in English (language='en'). Since the function expects 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country', we can use 'Paris, France'.\n    - Note: The function get_news_report expects a location in the format of 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. We are using 'Paris, France' which fits the requirement.\n    - We are also asked for English, so language='en'. \n    - The category is not specified, so we use the default 'General'. But note the user asked for the latest news without specifying category? However, the second request specifies technology. Since the first request doesn't specify, we use the default.\n\n 2. Latest news report for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news in English.\n    - Location: 'Letterkenny, Ireland'\n    - Category: 'Technology'\n    - Language: 'en'\n\n However, note that the function get_news_report can only handle one location at a time. Therefore, we need to make two separate calls.\n\n Steps:\n - First call: get_news_report for Paris, France with language='en' and category default (General).\n - Second call: get_news_report for Letterkenny, Ireland with category='Technology' and language='en'.\n\n But note: the function parameters for get_news_report are:\n   - location (required): string\n   - category: string (optional, default 'General')\n   - language: string (optional, default 'en')\n\n Therefore, we can make two function calls.\n\n Important: The function expects the state in short form for US locations, but for other countries we use \"City, Country\". Both Paris and Letterkenny are outside the US, so we use the country.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n For Paris, France:\n   location = \"Paris, France\"\n   category: not specified, so we can omit and it will default to 'General'\n   language: we want English, which is the default so we can omit? But to be explicit we can set it to 'en'\n\n For Letterkenny, Ireland:\n   location = \"Letterkenny, Ireland\"\n   category = \"Technology\"\n   language = \"en\"\n\n However, note the function definition: the category enum does not include 'General'? Wait, looking back: \n   enum: ['Politics', 'Technology', 'Sports', 'Entertainment', 'Health'] and default is 'General'. \n   But wait, the enum does not have 'General'. This might be an issue? Actually, the description says the default is 'General'. \n   But the enum does not list 'General'. This could be an error in the function definition? \n\n Since the user did not specify a category for Paris, we must use the default. However, if the function does not support 'General', we might have to avoid setting the category for Paris? \n\n Let me re-read the function definition for get_news_report:\n\n   \"category\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"...\",\n      \"enum\": ['Politics', 'Technology', 'Sports', 'Entertainment', 'Health'],\n      \"default\": \"General\"\n   }\n\n There is a discrepancy: the enum does not include 'General'. This might be a problem. But note the default is set to 'General'. \n\n How should we handle? Since the function is defined with a default and the enum does not include the default, it might be an error in the specification. However, as an agent we have to follow the specification.\n\n Given that, we have two options:\n   Option 1: Omit the category for Paris so that it uses the default. But if the function implementation does not accept 'General', it might fail.\n   Option 2: Since the user didn't specify, we might choose a category from the available ones? But the user asked for the latest news, which is general.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But here we are lacking a category? Actually, the category is optional because it has a default.\n\n So we will omit the category for Paris.\n\n But note: the function might not work as expected because the enum doesn't include the default. However, that's beyond our control. We are following the specification.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a category that is in the enum? But the user didn't specify. We should stick to the specification: if we don't set it, the function uses the default.\n\n Therefore, for Paris we call without category and with language set to 'en' (though we can omit language too because it's the default).\n\n However, to be safe and explicit, we can set language for both.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Call 1: \n   function: get_news_report\n   parameters: \n        location: \"Paris, France\"\n        language: \"en\"   (explicitly set, though default is 'en')\n        (skip category)\n\n Call 2:\n   function: get_news_report\n   parameters:\n        location: \"Letterkenny, Ireland\"\n        category: \"Technology\"\n        language: \"en\"\n\n But note: the function definition says the location must be in the format of 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. We are using 'City, Country' for both, which is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, we return two function calls in the required format.\n\n Format: \n   [func_name1(param1=value1, param2=value2), func_name2(param1=value1, param2=value2)]\n\n We must write the parameters as key=value, and string values in quotes? Actually, the format example is in a string that will be parsed. We are to output in the format of a function call without quotes for the keys? But note the example: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...)]\n\n However, the values that are strings must be in quotes? Actually, the system expects a string representation that can be evaluated. But the problem says: \"in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\"\n\n We are to represent the function call as if it were in code? But note the example: \"get_current_weather(location='San Francisco, CA', unit='celsius')\"\n\n So we use single quotes for string values.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n [get_news_report(location='Paris, France', language='en'), get_news_report(location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en')]\n\n However, note: the first call does not specify category so it will use the default. We are not passing category for the first call.\n\n But wait: the function definition for get_news_report has three parameters: location, category, and language. We are only required to pass location. The rest are optional.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   First call: get_news_report(location='Paris, France', language='en')\n   Second call: get_news_report(location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en')\n\n But note: the first call we are passing two parameters: location and language. We are skipping category. That is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can also skip language for the first call because it's the default? But the user explicitly asked for English, so we set it to be clear.\n\n Therefore, the function calls are as above.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and in the specified format.\n\n Let's write it:\n\n [get_news_report(location='Paris, France', language='en'), get_news_report(location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en')]\n\n But note: the system expects the entire response to be the function calls. We are returning two function calls in a list.\n\n Important: The problem says \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". We are making two calls to cover both locations.\n\n So we return the above."}

So we are just getting two separate lists.\n\n   How to get interviewers that know both? We don't have a function for that.

We are not specifying them, so they will use the defaults.\n\n   However, what if we want the same non-default experience_level? The user didn't specify, so we use the defaults.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        [get_interviewer_list(skill='Python'), get_interviewer_list(skill='Java')]\n\n   But wait: the function also has the parameter 'availability' which defaults to True. We are not changing it.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the user might want the same experience_level and availability for both? We are using the defaults for both, which is consistent.\n\n   But if the user wants a specific experience_level, we don't have that information. So we use the default.\n\n   So we output the two calls.\n\n   But what if the user intended both skills in one interviewer? We cannot satisfy that with the current functions.\n\n   Therefore, we do as above.\n\n   Alternatively, we might consider that the function does not support multiple skills and the request is ambiguous, but we have no way to ask.\n\n   We are limited by the functions.\n\n   So we do two calls.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But we are using the function, so we don't point it out.\n\n   And if the question lacks parameters? We have the required parameter 'skill'. The others are optional.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Therefore, we return:\n\n        [get_interviewer_list(skill='Python'), get_interviewer_list(skill='Java')]\n\n   But note: the function name is exactly as given: 'get_interviewer_list'\n\n   So we write:\n\n        [get_interviewer_list(skill='Python'), get_interviewer_list(skill='Java')]\n\n   However, the example format includes the parameter names. We are including them.\n\n   But what about the other parameters? We are not setting them, so they will use the defaults. That's acceptable.\n\n   But note: the function signature has two optional parameters. We are not required to set them if we want the default.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let's output the two function calls."}

We must break it down into the function calls provided.\n\nStep 1: Clone the repository\n  - We have the repo URL: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n  - We can use the function `clone_repo` for this.\n  - We don't specify a destination, so it will clone to the current directory (default).\n  - We don't need recursive or depth, so we can use defaults.\n\nStep 2: Analyse the contents of the repo and create:\n  2.1 Create/update Dockerfile based on the analysis.\n  2.2 Create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis.\n\n  - First, we need to analyse the repo to determine the predominant programming language. This is important because the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs might depend on the language. However, note that the `create_a_docker_file` function does not require the language; it will create a generic Dockerfile? But the problem says \"based on the analysis\". However, the function `create_a_docker_file` only takes a directory name. Similarly, `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also only takes a directory name and other optional parameters.\n\n  - But note: the `analyse_repo_contents` function returns the predominant language. However, the subsequent functions do not take the language as an input. So we might not need to call `analyse_repo_contents` explicitly? The problem says to create the files \"based on the analysis\". It might be that the functions `create_a_docker_file` and `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` are designed to do the analysis internally? But looking at their descriptions, they don't mention that.\n\n  - Alternatively, the problem might expect us to use `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language and then use that information to create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs? However, the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not have a parameter for the language.\n\n  - Since the functions are fixed and we cannot change them, we have to assume that the `create_a_docker_file` function will internally analyze the directory to create an appropriate Dockerfile? The description says: \"Generates a Dockerfile within the specified repository directory to enable containerization of the application.\" It doesn't specify how it does that, so it might do its own analysis.\n\n  - Similarly, the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function does not require the language.\n\n  - Therefore, we can skip calling `analyse_repo_contents` if the Dockerfile and Kubernetes creation functions are designed to handle the analysis. But the problem explicitly says to \"analyse the contents\" in step 2.\n\n  - Let's re-read: \"2. analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". It might be that we are expected to call `analyse_repo_contents` and then use the result to conditionally call the other functions? But the functions for Docker and Kubernetes don't take the language as input.\n\n  - Since we cannot pass the language to the Docker and Kubernetes functions, and the problem does not specify how the analysis should be used, we might have to call `analyse_repo_contents` just to satisfy the step? But then we don't use the result.\n\n  - Alternatively, the problem might be that the Dockerfile creation function requires the directory name, which we have. So we can directly create the Dockerfile without the analysis? But the step says \"based on the analysis\". \n\n  - Considering the function set, we have two options:\n      Option 1: Call `analyse_repo_contents` and then ignore the result because the other functions don't require it. But that seems wasteful.\n      Option 2: Realize that the `create_a_docker_file` function might internally do the analysis? The description doesn't say that.\n\n  - Given the ambiguity, I think we should follow the steps literally. We are required to analyse the repo. So we call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory. Then we create the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n  - However, note that the problem says: \"create/update dockerfile\" and \"kubernetes yamls\". The functions we have are for creating, but they might update if they are called again? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  - We'll assume that the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs are created from scratch.\n\n  - The directory name for the cloned repo: since we cloned without specifying a destination, it will be in the current directory and the directory will be the name of the repo, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. So we can use that as the directory name.\n\n  - Steps for step 2:\n        - Call `analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')`\n        - Then call `create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')`\n        - Then call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')`\n\n  - For `create_kubernetes_yaml_file`, we are not given any specific parameters (like deployment_name, image_name, etc.), so we use the defaults.\n\nStep 3: Add all changed files to git changes\n  - We don't have a function for `git add` specifically, but note the function `push_git_changes_to_github` says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes\". So step 3 is handled by the push function.\n\nStep 4: Commit and push to repo\n  - We have the function `push_git_changes_to_github` which will add, commit, and push.\n  - We are not given a commit message, so we use the default: 'Update changes'\n  - We are not given a branch name, so default to 'main'\n  - We are not forcing, so force_push=False.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of function calls:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nBut note: the `push_git_changes_to_github` function requires the directory_name, which is the same as the cloned repo directory.\n\nHowever, what if the clone_repo function clones into a directory that is not the current working directory? We specified the default destination (current working directory) and the repo will be cloned into a directory named 'nodejs-welcome' inside the current working directory. So the directory name we use for the other functions is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nBut note: the function `clone_repo` returns? We don't have a function to get the directory name. We assume the directory name is the last part of the repo URL without the .git: so 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nTherefore, we can proceed.\n\nLet's write the function calls in order:\n\n[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), \n analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), \n create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), \n create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), \n push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then step 4 is \"commit / push\". The push function does both the add (all changes) and commit and push. So step 3 is included in step 4.\n\nWe have covered all steps.\n\nHowever, note that the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has optional parameters. We are using the defaults. The problem doesn't specify any, so that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the above list of function calls."}

Since we want to include subdirectories, we set `include_subdirectories` to True.\n\n For the second task, we need to get the method signatures for two methods in the class 'AbstractCellHandler'. We can use the function `get_signature` for each method. However, note that `get_signature` requires the class name and the method name. We are only interested in the signatures, and we are not including private methods (so we can leave `include_private` as default, which is False).\n\n But note: the second task requires information about two methods in the same class. We can call `get_signature` twice, once for each method.\n\n However, there is a function `get_class_info` that can get all methods of a class. But the user specifically asks for the signatures of two methods. We could use `get_class_info` and then extract the two methods? But the function `get_class_info` returns a lot of information (methods, properties, constructor). Alternatively, we can call `get_signature` for each method.\n\n Since the user is specifically asking for the signatures of two methods, we can call `get_signature` for each.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Use `get_relevant_classes` to search for classes related to 'CellResult', including subdirectories.\n    - Parameters: search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True\n\n 2.

Use `get_signature` for the method 'getCellValue' in class 'AbstractCellHandler'\n    - Parameters: class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name='getCellValue'\n\n But note: the function `get_signature` has an optional parameter `include_private` which we don't need to set (default is False).\n\n However, note that the project is in Java, but the function descriptions are in Python 3 syntax? The functions we have are generic and should work for any language? But the function `get_signature` and `get_class_info` are described in the context of the module and class, and we are in a Java project. The tool might be designed to work for multiple languages? The function `get_imports` has a parameter for language. But the other functions don't specify language. We assume they are language-agnostic? Or the tool is for a specific project? The user mentioned Java, but the function descriptions are in Python. We must rely on the tool being able to handle Java.\n\n Alternatively, note that the function `get_relevant_classes` is for the repository, so it should be language-agnostic.\n\n Let's proceed with the calls.\n\n We are going to make three function calls.\n\n But note: the function `get_relevant_classes` returns a list of class names. We are only interested in classes related to 'CellResult'. We are using the search_string='CellResult'. We set `case_sensitive` to False by default? The user didn't specify, so we use default.\n\n We are going to output:\n\n [get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), \n  get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"),\n  get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]\n\n However, note that the function `get_signature` requires the class name and method name. We are providing exactly what the user asked.\n\n But what if the class 'AbstractCellHandler' is not in the current module? The function `get_signature` does not have a module parameter. The function `get_class_info` has an optional module_name, but `get_signature` does not. So we assume that the class is known in the context.\n\n Alternatively, the tool might have a way to resolve the class without the module? We'll go ahead.\n\n Let's write the function calls in the required format."}

Calculate the area of a square with a side of size 5 cm.\n 2. Get the weather in Queenstown, Singapore.\n\n We have two functions available:\n - get_area_of_square: requires the parameter 'size' (a float) which is the side length.\n - get_current_weather: requires the parameter 'location' (a string) and optionally 'unit' (with default).\n\n For the first task:\n   We note that the side is given as \"5 cm\". The function only requires the numerical value (5.0) and the unit (cm) is not used by the function because the area will be in square units of the input. However, the function description does not specify unit conversion. Since the function expects a float for the size, we can pass 5.0.\n\n For the second task:\n   The location is \"Queenstown Singapore\". We should format it as a string that the function expects, such as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function expects a string in the format of 'City, State' or 'City, Country'. Since Queenstown is a district in Singapore, we can represent it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\n We can make two function calls in one go.\n\n Note: The user did not specify the temperature unit for the weather, so we can use the default (fahrenheit) or if we prefer we can choose a unit. However, the function has a default, so we can omit the unit. But note: Singapore typically uses Celsius, so we might want to get it in Celsius. However, the user did not specify, so we can either use the default or choose one. Since the function has a default, we can leave it out. But the problem says if the question lacks parameters and they are required, we point it out? The unit is optional because it has a default. So we don't need to include it unless we want to change from the default.\n\n However, the user did not specify, so we can use the default (fahrenheit). But since the user is asking about Singapore, which uses Celsius, it might be more appropriate to get it in Celsius. But the instruction says: if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, point it out. The required parameter for get_current_weather is only the location. The unit is optional. Therefore, we can choose to pass unit='celsius' to get the temperature in Celsius because that is more standard for Singapore. Alternatively, we can leave it as default. However, the problem does not require us to make assumptions beyond what is provided. But note: the user didn't specify, so we can use the default. However, the function's default is fahrenheit. To be more user-friendly, we might choose to use Celsius. But the instruction says: if the question lacks parameters, point it out? But unit is optional so we don't have to. Alternatively, we can use the default and then convert later? But we don't have a conversion function.\n\n Since the function allows us to specify the unit, and we know that Singapore uses Celsius, we can specify unit='celsius'. However, the user did not ask for a specific unit. So it is acceptable to use the default? But the problem says: if the question lacks parameters, we point it out. However, the unit is optional and we are not required to point out missing optional parameters. So we can choose either. Let's stick to the default (fahrenheit) because the function will use that if we don't specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the user is likely expecting Celsius? But the instruction says: only return the function calls. And we are allowed to choose the unit? Since the function has an enum and a default, we can decide.\n\n But note: the user did not specify, so we can use the default. However, to be safe and because the function has a default, we can omit the unit. But if we do that, it will be in fahrenheit. Alternatively, we can include unit='celsius' because the location is in Singapore? But the user didn't specify. Since the problem doesn't require us to assume, and the function has a default, we can just pass the location.\n\n However, let me re-read the function description: it says \"Retrieves the current weather conditions for a specified location\". The user did not specify the unit, so we can use the default. So we don't need to pass the unit.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" Since unit is not required (it's optional with a default), we don't have to point it out. So we can just call with location.\n\n However, the user's question is about two things. We can do both.\n\n But note: the area function does not require a unit and the weather function does require location. We have the location as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". We can format it as such.\n\n So we will make two calls:\n\n 1. get_area_of_square(size=5.0)\n 2. get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\")\n\n However, note: the area function expects a float. 5 cm is 5.0.\n\n But wait: the area function does not take unit? It returns the area in the same unit squared. The user gave cm, so the area will be 25 cm\u00b2? But the function doesn't return a unit. It just returns a number. So we must be cautious. However, the function description says: \"Calculate the area of a square by squaring the length of one of its sides.\" It doesn't say anything about units. So we just pass the number.\n\n However, the user might expect the unit? But our function doesn't handle that. So we just compute the number.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function does not handle units and the user provided a unit. But the function doesn't have a parameter for unit. So we just use the number.\n\n So the function calls are:\n\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\")]\n\n But note: the function get_current_weather expects the location in a specific format. We are formatting it as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". This should be acceptable.\n\n However, note that Queenstown is a district in Singapore. The function might work with \"Queenstown, Singapore\" or it might require the city name? The description says: \"The location for which to get the weather, in the format of 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'\". Queenstown is a district, not a city. The city is Singapore. But the function might not be able to handle districts? We don't know. The user asked for \"Queenstown Singapore\", so we pass it as such. If the weather service doesn't have data for Queenstown, it might return the weather for Singapore. That's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can just get the weather for Singapore? But the user specifically said \"Queenstown Singapore\". So we try to pass \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\n So the final answer is two function calls.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"if none of the functions can be used, point it out\". Both functions are used. And for the weather, we are providing the required parameter (location). The unit is optional and we are omitting it (so it will be fahrenheit).\n\n But if we are concerned about the unit, we can choose to pass unit='celsius'. Since the user is in Singapore, it's more standard. We can do that. But the user didn't specify. Let's choose to use Celsius because it's more appropriate for the location.\n\n So we can do:\n\n get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")\n\n But note: the function's default is fahrenheit, but we are allowed to change it. The user didn't specify, but we can choose to set it to celsius.\n\n Alternatively, we can leave it as default? The problem doesn't specify. Since the function has the ability to set the unit and we know the context, we can set it to celsius.\n\n I think it's better to set it to celsius for Singapore.\n\n So let's change the weather call to include unit='celsius'.\n\n Therefore, the two function calls are:\n\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")]\n\n However, note: the function call format must be exact. The function name and parameters must match.\n\n But wait: the function parameters for get_current_weather are 'location' and 'unit'. We are providing both. But note: the function says unit is optional and has a default. So we are allowed to pass it.\n\n Alternatively, we could do without? But we choose to pass unit='celsius'.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n Final function call string:\n\n [get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\", unit=\"celsius\")]"}

Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")\n\nBut note: the search function requires the city in the format: \"City, State (abbr)\". The user said \"Sunnyvale, CA\" which is exactly in the format we need (with the state abbreviation). So we can use that.\n\nHowever, the booking function: we are using the salon name as the stylist_name. That is allowed by the function.\n\nSo we output two function calls.\n\nBut note: the instructions say to output in the format: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\nWe must output the function calls in the required format.\n\nTherefore:\n  [Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\", is_unisex=\"dontcare\"), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")]\n\nHowever, note that the `is_unisex` parameter in `Services_1_FindProvider` has a default of 'dontcare', so we can omit it? But the function signature says it has a default. But the problem says: if we want to use the default, we can skip it? But the instructions say to include the parameters. However, the function definition includes a default. But to be safe, we can include it explicitly? Or we can skip? \n\nLooking at the function parameters: the required parameter is only 'city'. The rest are optional. But the user didn't specify unisex or not, so we use the default. We can either set it to the default explicitly or omit it? \n\nBut the format we are to use is: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]. We are allowed to omit optional parameters? \n\nHowever, the function has a default, so we can omit. But the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the required parameters are provided. \n\nBut to be safe, we can set it to the default value? The default is 'dontcare'. So we can set `is_unisex=\"dontcare\"` or omit? \n\nThe function definition says: \n  'is_unisex': {'type': 'boolean', 'description': ..., 'enum': ['True', 'False', 'dontcare'], 'default': 'dontcare'}\n\nSo if we omit, the function should use the default. But in the function call format, we can omit optional parameters? \n\nBut the instructions do not specify. However, in the example format, they show only the parameters that are passed. So we can omit optional parameters that are set to their default? \n\nAlternatively, we can include it to be explicit? \n\nSince the user didn't specify, and the default is 'dontcare', we can omit. \n\nBut note: the function call format we are to use is a string. We must be consistent. \n\nGiven that, I think we can omit the optional parameter. So:\n\n  [Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\"), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")]\n\nHowever, the function `Services_1_FindProvider` has only one required parameter: city. So we can just pass city.\n\nBut wait: the function has an optional parameter. We are not using it, so we can skip.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n[Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\"), Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")]"}
