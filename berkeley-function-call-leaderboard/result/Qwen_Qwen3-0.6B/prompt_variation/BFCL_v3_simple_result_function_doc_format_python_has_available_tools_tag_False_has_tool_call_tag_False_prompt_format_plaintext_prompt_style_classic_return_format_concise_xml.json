Wait, the parameters are a list, but the user didn't provide any. Hmm, maybe the function defaults to all available info. So I should call get_info with name 'Ticket to Ride' and maybe leave parameters as default. But the user didn't specify any parameters, so perhaps only the name is needed. Let me check the function's parameters again. The parameters are optional, so maybe the function can handle it. So the correct function call would be boardgame.get_info with name 'Ticket to Ride'. No other parameters are needed here. The user didn't mention any other details, so that's all."}

Let me check the available functions. There's a function called find_card_in_deck that takes rank, suit, and deck. The deck is a list if not provided. The user didn't mention the deck, so I assume the default deck is a standard 52-card one. So I need to call find_card_in_deck with rank 'Queen' and suit 'Hearts'. The deck parameter is optional, so I can omit it. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function's requirements. The function expects rank and suit as strings, and deck as a list. Since the user didn't provide the deck, I'll use the default.

Wait, the function's default is 1000, but the user wants less than 500. So I should set maxCalories to 499 or something. But the function's parameters are int, so I can input 499. So the function call would be find_recipe(recipeName=\"pasta carbonara\", maxCalories=499). That should find a pasta carbonara recipe under 500 calories."}

The provided function is hotel_booking. The parameters required are location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences. \n\nThe user specified the location as Manhattan, New York. The room type is single. The duration is 3 nights, so duration is 3. The start date is March 10th, 2023. Preferences mention pet-friendly, but the function's preferences parameter is a list. Since the user didn't specify any other preferences, maybe I should leave that out. \n\nWait, the function's preferences are optional. So if they're not provided, it uses all. But the user mentioned pet-friendly, so maybe include that. However, the function's preferences parameter is a list, so I can add it as a list with the pet-friendly keyword. \n\nSo the parameters would be location: \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type: \"single\", duration: 3, start_date: \"2023-03-10\", preferences: [\"pet-friendly\"]. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present.
