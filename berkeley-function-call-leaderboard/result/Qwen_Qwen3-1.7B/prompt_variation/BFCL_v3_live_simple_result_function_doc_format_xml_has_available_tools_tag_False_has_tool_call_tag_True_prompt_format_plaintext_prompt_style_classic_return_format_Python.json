So the function call should include city=\"Mumbai\" and movie_date as today's date. \n\nI need to check if the function requires movie_date as a required parameter. The function's parameters show that movie_date is optional, with a default of current date. So even if the user doesn't specify, the function will use the current date. But since the user explicitly said \"today,\" maybe it's better to include it. However, the system's instruction says to default to current date, so maybe it's safe to just pass the city and let the function handle the date. \n\nSo the function call would be get_movies with city=\"Mumbai\".

The departure_date is March 16th, 2024, which needs to be in dd/mm/yyyy format. The user said \"16th of March 2024,\" so that's 16/03/2024.

The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I don't need to add anything else. Just make sure the date format is correct and the time is in 24-hour format. Since the user specified \"around 14:00,\" maybe the function can handle that by checking available times, but the parameters require a specific time. So the user's request is to find something that leaves around 14:00, which the function might handle by searching for available times near that hour. But the function's parameters require a specific departure_time, so the user's input is probably expecting to set the time to 14:00. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is book_flight with departure_location='JFK', departure_date='16/03/2024', departure_time='14:00'."}
