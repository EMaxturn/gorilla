The function requires desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional, default 6). The user is asking for two rolls of a six.

So the parameters would be rank='Queen', suit='Hearts'. Then the function will handle the deck. I think that's all. Let me check if there are any other parameters or if the function needs the deck. No, the deck is optional. So the correct call is find_card_in_deck with rank and suit."}

The user wants to find a pasta carbonara recipe that has less than 500 calories. The available function is find_recipe, which takes recipeName and maxCalories. The recipeName here is \"pasta carbonara\", and the maxCalories should be less than 500. The function's default for maxCalories is 1000, so I need to set it to 499 to ensure it's less than 500. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires recipeName and maxCalories. So I'll call find_recipe with those parameters."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting on March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the functions available. There's the hotel_booking function. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are location, room_type, duration, start_date. The preferences are optional and default to all if not specified.\n\nThe user mentioned \"pet friendly\" so I should include that in preferences. The location is Manhattan, New York. The room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. \n\nWait, the start_date parameter expects a string. The user provided the date as March 10th, 2023. I need to format it correctly. Maybe as \"2023-03-10\" or \"March 10, 2023\". The function's example uses a date string, so probably better to use the ISO format. But the exact format might depend on the function's internal handling. However, since the user provided it as \"March 10th, 2023\", maybe the function can accept that as a string. But to be safe, maybe use the ISO format. But the user's input is March 10th, 2023. Let me check the function's parameters again. The start_date is a string, so the user's input is acceptable as a string. So I can pass \"March 10, 2023\" as the start_date.\n\nPreferences are \"pet friendly\" and \"near Manhattan, New York\". Wait, the preferences are a list. So I need to include that. The function's preferences are optional, and if not specified, default to all. But the user specified \"pet friendly\" and \"near Manhattan, New York\". So I should include those in the preferences list.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nlocation: \"Manhattan, New York\"\n\nroom_type: \"single\"\n\nduration: 3\n\nstart_date: \"March 10, 2023\"\n\npreferences: [\"pet friendly\", \"near Manhattan, New York\"]\n\nWait, but the preferences are a list. So the function expects a list of preferences. So the parameters would be:\n\n{\n    \"location\": \"Manhattan, New York\",\n    \"room_type\": \"single\",\n    \"duration\": 3,\n    \"start_date\": \"March 10, 2023\",\n    \"preferences\": [\"pet friendly\", \"near Manhattan, New York\"]\n}\n\nI think that's all. The function should handle these parameters. Let me make sure I didn't miss any required parameters. The function requires location, room_type, duration, start_date. Preferences are optional. So this should be sufficient."}

The function requires base_currency, target_currency, and amount. \n\nThe user's question has all three: the amount is 20,000, base_currency is Japanese Yen (JPY), and target_currency is US Dollar (USD).
