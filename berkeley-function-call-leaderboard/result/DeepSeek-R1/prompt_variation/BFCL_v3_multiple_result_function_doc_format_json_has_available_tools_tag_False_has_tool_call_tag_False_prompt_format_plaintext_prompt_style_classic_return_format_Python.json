However, we are not asked for the currency but the price. Also, note that the question is about the price, not the currency.\n\n2. `video_games.on_sale`: This function checks if a game is on sale. It doesn't return the price.\n\n3. `video_games.store_price`: This function fetches the selling price of a game on a platform in a region.\n\nSo, we can use `video_games.store_price` to get the price for 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' on PlayStation in the United States.\n\nBut note: the question asks for the \"cheapest selling price\". Since the game is sold in the PlayStation Store in one region (United States) and on one platform (PlayStation), we expect one price. However, it's possible that the same game might have different editions (like standard, deluxe, etc.) but the function `store_price` does not specify edition. \n\nGiven the function parameters, we can only get one price? Or does the function return multiple prices? The function description does not specify. Since the function is designed to return the selling price, and the parameters are game_title, platform, and region, we assume it returns the price for the standard edition or the base game.\n\nAlternatively, the user might be implying that we compare across regions? But the question specifies \"in the United States\". So we are only looking at the United States.\n\nTherefore, we can directly call `video_games.store_price` for the given game, platform, and region.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a parameter `region` that defaults to 'United States'. So we can either explicitly set the region or rely on the default.\n\nHowever, the question explicitly states \"in the United States\", so we can set the region to 'United States' to be clear.\n\nParameters:\n- game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n- platform: 'PlayStation'\n- region: 'United States'\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` requires `game_title` and `platform`. The region is optional and defaults to 'United States'. So we can omit the region if we wish, but including it for clarity is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" Here, we have all the required parameters.\n\nThus, we can make the call:\n\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the \"cheapest\" price. Since we are only getting one price (for the base game in the US region on PlayStation), that will be the price. However, if the function returns multiple prices for different editions, we would have to compare? But the function doesn't specify that it returns multiple. We have to assume it returns one price for the base game.\n\nAlternatively, if the function returns multiple editions, then we would have to process the result to find the minimum. However, we are only allowed to call functions. We cannot do processing unless we have a function that returns multiple and then we have another function to compare? But we don't have a function to compare.\n\nGiven the constraints, we assume that the `store_price` function returns the base game price. Therefore, we can use that.\n\nBut note: the question says \"cheapest selling price\". It might be that the game is on sale and there are two prices: original and sale? However, the function `store_price` should return the current selling price (which would be the sale price if on sale). So that should be the price the user pays.\n\nAlternatively, we might need to check if the game is on sale? But the `on_sale` function only returns a boolean, not the price. And the `store_price` function should already reflect the sale price if it is on sale.\n\nTherefore, we can simply call `store_price`.\n\nSo the function call is:\n\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` has a parameter `region` that is optional and defaults to 'United States'. So we can also write without the region:\n\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation')]\n\nBut to be explicit and clear, we can include the region.\n\nLet's choose to include the region.\n\nFinal call:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]"}

The question says \"Apple Inc\". We should use that exactly? But note that the function might require a ticker? The description says \"The company that you want to get the dividend data for.\" It doesn't specify if it's the ticker or the full name.\n\n However, the function does not specify.

However, note that the function parameter for art_form is a string. \n    We can use \"sculpture\" and note that we are looking for modern ones? But the function does not have a parameter for era or style.\n  - The time is \"upcoming month\". The function has a 'month' parameter, but we don't have a specific month. \n    The function description says: \"Default value will return upcoming events.\" So we can omit the month and it will default to upcoming.\n  - We want \"top rated\", which we can interpret as high user ratings. The function has a 'user_ratings' parameter that can be set to 'high'.\n\n Therefore, we should call the function 'find_exhibition' with:\n   location: \"New York, NY\" (or just \"New York\"? The function expects a city. We can use \"New York, NY\" to be safe.)\n   art_form: \"sculpture\" (but note: the task says \"modern sculpture\". However, the function does not have a style filter. \n        We can only hope that the backend considers modern ones? But the function does not allow filtering by era. \n        Alternatively, we might have to adjust the art_form? The function doesn't have a parameter for style. \n        Since the function does not support style, we have to use \"sculpture\". We are relying on the backend to have modern ones as the popular ones? \n        But the task says \"modern\". However, without a function parameter for style, we cannot specify. \n        So we must use the available parameters and hope the backend returns modern ones? \n        Alternatively, note that the function returns the most popular exhibitions. It's possible that modern ones are popular. \n        But the task says \"top rated\", and we are setting user_ratings to 'high'. We can only use the available parameters.)\n\n   However, the function does not have a parameter for style (like modern). Therefore, we cannot specify modern. \n   But note: the function description says it returns the most popular exhibitions. We are to find the top rated. \n   We are setting user_ratings to 'high'. We can only use the available parameters.\n\n   We must use:\n      location: \"New York, NY\"\n      art_form: \"sculpture\"   (note: the function parameter is \"art_form\", and we are using the string for sculpture)\n      user_ratings: 'high'\n\n   We can omit the month because the default is upcoming.\n\n   The required parameters are: ['location', 'art_form'].\n\n   So we call:\n      find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n   But note: the task says \"modern sculpture\". We don't have a way to specify \"modern\". However, the function does not support it. \n   We have to hope that the backend returns exhibitions that are modern? Or maybe the backend considers the art_form string to include style? \n   Since we cannot specify, we have to use what we have.\n\n   Alternatively, we might consider that the function's backend might have a way to interpret \"modern sculpture\" as an art_form? \n   But the function expects a string. We could try to pass \"modern sculpture\" as the art_form? \n\n   Let me check the function definition: the art_form parameter is a string. There is no restriction on what string we can pass? \n   Actually, the function does not have an enum for art_form. So we can pass any string. \n\n   We can try to pass art_form as \"modern sculpture\", but note that the function might not recognize that. \n   However, the description of the function says: \"the form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture\". \n   So it's free text. We can try to pass \"modern sculpture\" and hope the backend can handle it. \n\n   Alternatively, if we pass \"sculpture\", we might get all sculpture exhibitions and then we have to filter for modern? \n   But we cannot do that because we are only allowed to call the functions. \n\n   Since the function does not have a style parameter, we must rely on the art_form string to capture both. \n\n   We decide to pass art_form as \"modern sculpture\". \n\n   But note: the function might not have a category for \"modern sculpture\", and it might be better to use \"sculpture\" and then rely on the popularity and rating to surface modern ones? \n\n   However, the task says \"modern sculpture\". We should try to be as specific as possible. \n\n   Therefore, we will call the function with art_form=\"modern sculpture\". If that doesn't work, we might have to adjust in a later step? \n   But note: we are only allowed to output function calls. We cannot do multiple steps without the function. \n\n   Alternatively, we can try to call with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then note that we want modern ones? But the function doesn't let us filter by style. \n\n   Considering the constraints, we will use art_form=\"sculpture\" and hope that the backend returns modern ones as the top ones? \n\n   However, the task says \"modern sculpture\". We must try to represent that. \n\n   Let me see: the function's art_form parameter is described as \"the form of art\". We can interpret \"modern sculpture\" as a form? \n\n   We decide to use: art_form=\"modern sculpture\"\n\n   Also, note: the function returns a list of exhibitions. We are to find the top rated, and we are setting user_ratings to 'high'. \n   The function should return the most popular exhibitions that are high rated. We are not specifying how many, so we assume it returns the top one? \n\n   But note: the function does not have a parameter for the number of results. So we get a list and we are to pick the top one? \n   However, the task says \"the top rated\", meaning the highest rated one. The function should return the exhibitions sorted by popularity (which is based on ratings and other factors?) and we are filtering by high ratings. \n\n   We are only making one function call. We are not allowed to process the results. The function will return the exhibitions, and we assume the first one is the top? \n\n   But note: the function's description says: \"Locate the most popular exhibitions\". So it returns the most popular ones, which are already top. \n\n   We are setting user_ratings to 'high', so we are only getting high rated ones. \n\n   Therefore, we call:\n\n      find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n   However, note that the function requires two parameters: location and art_form. We are providing both and also user_ratings. \n\n   We are omitting month because the default is upcoming.\n\n   But wait: the function's 'month' parameter is described as: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" \n   So we don't need to specify month.\n\n   Also, note: the function might return multiple exhibitions. But the task asks for the top rated. We assume the function returns the top one? \n   Actually, the function does not specify how many. We are not allowed to specify a limit. \n\n   However, the task says \"the top rated\", meaning one. We assume the function returns the top one? Or a list? \n   We are only making the call and then the system will present the results. \n\n   Since we cannot control the number of results, we call the function and then the system will return the list. \n   We are only responsible for the function call.\n\n   Therefore, we make the call as above.\n\n   But note: the function might not recognize \"modern sculpture\". We have to hope that it does. \n   Alternatively, if we are concerned, we might call with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then in the results we would have to filter for modern? \n   But we cannot do that because we are only allowed to call the functions. \n\n   We decide to try with \"modern sculpture\". If it returns nothing, then we might have to adjust? \n   But we are only allowed to output one set of function calls per turn. \n\n   We are going to output:\n\n      [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n   However, note: the function's art_form parameter is a string. There is no guarantee that \"modern sculpture\" is a valid category. \n   But the function does not specify any enum. So we are free to try.\n\n   Alternatively, we might call with art_form=\"sculpture\" and then hope that the top result is modern? \n   But the task specifically says \"modern\". \n\n   We are in a dilemma. \n\n   Let me re-read the function: \n        'find_exhibition': ... properties: 'art_form': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.'}\n\n   The example is \"sculpture\". But it does not say that it must be from a fixed set. \n\n   We decide to use \"modern sculpture\" because the task requires modern. \n\n   But note: the function might not have a way to combine style and form. It might have separate fields? But the function doesn't have a style parameter. \n\n   Therefore, we must pass the style in the art_form string. \n\n   We try: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n   If the function doesn't return any results, then we might have to try again? But we are only allowed one call in this turn. \n\n   We are to make the best effort. \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the task says \"modern sculpture\", which might be considered a form of art? \n\n   We proceed.\n\n   Also, note: the location. We use \"New York, NY\" because it's a common way to specify New York City.\n\n   Therefore, the function call is:\n\n      find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n   But note: the function's parameter for user_ratings has a default of 'high'. So we could omit it? \n   However, the task says \"top rated\", which we interpret as high ratings. The default is high, so we can omit. \n   But to be explicit, we set it to 'high'.\n\n   Alternatively, we can omit it and rely on the default. \n\n   The function description: \"user_ratings\": ... default is 'high'\n\n   So we can omit it. But including it does not hurt. \n\n   We decide to include it to be explicit.\n\n   Final call:\n\n      find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n   However, note: the function requires the parameters to be passed by name. We are using the correct names.\n\n   We output the function call in the required format.\n\n   Since we are only making one call, we write:\n\n      [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n   But note: the function name is 'find_exhibition', not 'find_exhibition**s**'. The function is named exactly as provided.\n\n   We are using the exact name: 'find_exhibition'\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n      [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n   However, note: the art_form string might have to be exactly as the backend expects. We are taking a chance.\n\n   We hope that the backend can handle \"modern sculpture\".\n\n   If the backend does not, we might get no results. But we are following the task as closely as possible.\n\n   We have no other function to call for this task.\n\n   We do not call any other function because:\n      - card_game_probability.calculate is not relevant.\n      - get_sculpture_info is for a specific artist, and we don't have an artist name.\n\n   Therefore, we make the above call."}
