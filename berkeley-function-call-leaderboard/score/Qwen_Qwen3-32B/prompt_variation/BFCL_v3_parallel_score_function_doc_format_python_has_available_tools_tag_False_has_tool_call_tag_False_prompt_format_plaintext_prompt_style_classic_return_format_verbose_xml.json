The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers in a specific order. First, they want the HCF of 45 and 60. Then, use that result to find the HCF with 90 and 120. Then, do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, so the first step is to compute HCF(45, 60). Let me note that down. The function provided is math.hcf, which takes two integers. So I can call that function for each pair.\n\nOnce I get the HCF of 45 and 60, let's call that result A. Then I need to compute HCF of A with 90 and 120? Wait, no. Wait the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe it's HCF(A, 90) and then HCF(A, 120)? Or is it HCF of the three numbers? Wait, no. The HCF function given takes two numbers. So perhaps the user wants to take the result from the first HCF (which is 15, I think) and then compute HCF of 15 with 90, and then HCF of 15 with 120? Or maybe HCF of 90 and 120 using the previous result? Wait, no. The wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the question.\n\nOriginal question: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So after getting HCF(45,60) = A, then find HCF(A, 90, 120)? But the function only takes two numbers. So maybe it's HCF(A, 90) and then HCF(A, 120)? Or perhaps HCF of 90 and 120, then HCF of that with A? The user's wording is a bit ambiguous. But given that the function is for two numbers, I think the correct approach is to first compute HCF(45,60) = A, then compute HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120). But the user might have intended to compute HCF of A with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(A, HCF(90,120))? Or maybe HCF(A, 90) and then HCF that result with 120? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (A, 90) and then HCF of that result with 120. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear. However, given the function's parameters, I can only use two numbers at a time. So perhaps the user wants to first compute HCF(45,60) = A, then compute HCF(A, 90) = B, then HCF(B, 120). But the question says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe it's HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120). But the user might have intended to compute HCF of A with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(A, 90, 120), but since the function can't handle three numbers, perhaps the user wants to compute HCF of A with 90 and then HCF of that result with 120. But the question isn't clear. However, given the function's parameters, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nBut the user also asks to do the same for (36,48) and then with (72,96). So perhaps the process is: compute HCF of first pair, then compute HCF of that result with each number in the next pair. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (45,60) = A, then compute HCF of (A, 90) and HCF of (A, 120). Then do the same for (36,48) and (72,96). But the user's instruction is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, I can only use two numbers at a time. So I'll proceed to call the function for each pair as per the user's instruction.\n\nSo first, compute HCF(45,60). Then, use that result to compute HCF with 90 and 120. Wait, but how? Maybe the user wants to compute HCF of (A, 90) and HCF of (A, 120). Then, compute HCF(36,48) = C, then compute HCF of (C,72) and HCF of (C,96). But the user's question is a bit unclear. However, given the function's parameters, I'll proceed to make the necessary function calls.\n\nSo the first step is to call math.hcf with 45 and 60. Then, take that result and call math.hcf with 90 and 120? Wait, no. Wait, the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So perhaps the result from the first HCF is used as one of the numbers in the next HCF. For example, if the first HCF is A, then compute HCF(A, 90) and HCF(A, 120). But the user might have intended to compute HCF of A with the pair (90,120), which would be HCF(A, 90, 120), but since the function can't handle three numbers, perhaps the user wants to compute HCF of A with 90 and then HCF of that result with 120.
