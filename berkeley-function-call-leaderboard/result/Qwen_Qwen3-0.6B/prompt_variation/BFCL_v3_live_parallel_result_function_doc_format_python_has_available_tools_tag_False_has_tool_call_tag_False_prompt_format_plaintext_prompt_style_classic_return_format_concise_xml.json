The default is fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify, so maybe include it as a parameter. \n\nWait, the parameters for get_current_weather are location (string) and unit (default fahrenheit).

The user mentioned they had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea. Then they also had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee. The task is to log these items. But wait, the function provided is for logging food items with a portion size. The user's items are in different units and types. For example, the mango is frozen, so maybe the portion unit is frozen? But the function requires a portion_unit. The user didn't specify the unit for each item. Also, the meal_type is mentioned, but the user didn't specify which meal. The log_date is also missing. So I need to call the log_food function for each item, but I need to get the parameters. The user's items are separate, so each should be logged individually. But the function requires parameters like food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type, and log_date. Since the user didn't provide the unit for each item, maybe I can assume some default or use the given names. Wait, the user's items are \"8 pieces of frozen mango\" and \"chai tea\", so maybe the portion_amount is 8, and the unit is \"piece\". Similarly, \"two slices of pepperoni pizza\" would be portion_amount 2, unit \"slice\". But the meal_type is not specified. The default is snack, but maybe the user's items are snacks. The log_date is missing. So I need to call the function for each item, but the parameters are missing. Therefore, the correct approach is to make separate function calls for each item, using the provided names and assuming the necessary parameters. So the first call would be log_food with food_name 'mango', portion_amount 8, portion_unit 'piece', meal_type 'snack', and log_date as a placeholder. Similarly for the other items. But since the user didn't provide log_date, maybe the function expects it, so I can include it. So the final answer would be multiple function calls for each item."}
