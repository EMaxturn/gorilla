They mentioned straight line motion, so I can use the kinematics equations.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called kinematics.calculate_displacement. Let me check its parameters. It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and an optional rounding. The initial_speed here is 20 m/s, acceleration is 10 m/s\u00b2, time is 5 seconds. All required parameters are provided. The user didn't specify rounding, so I can omit that. \n\nI should call the calculate_displacement function with these values. The parameters match the required types: integers for all three required fields. So the function call should be correct."}

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are both given here: 20 meters and 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest, so initial_speed is probably set to 0 by default. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speed and time, but we don't have final speed here. So that's not the right one. \n\nSo the correct function is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4. The initial_speed isn't needed since it's starting from rest. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The function's required parameters are distance (integer) and time (integer). The user provided both as 20 and 4, which are integers. So that's all set. I should call that function."}

The wall is a rectangle, so area is length multiplied by height. That would be 30 feet times 12 feet. Let me calculate that: 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.\n\nNext, the paint coverage is 400 square feet per gallon. So, the amount of paint needed is the total area divided by the coverage rate. That's 360 / 400. Let me do that division: 360 divided by 400 equals 0.9 gallons. \n\nWait, but paint is usually sold in whole gallons, but the question doesn't specify rounding up. The function might just return the exact value. Let me check the parameters for the calculate_paint_needed function. The parameters required are coverage_rate, length, and height. All are integers. The function should handle the calculation. \n\nSo, the function call should have coverage_rate=400, length=30, height=12. The function will compute (30*12)/400, which is 0.9.
