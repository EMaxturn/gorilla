The parameters needed are desired_sum, n_rolls (default 1), and sides_per_die (required). The user specified the sum as 7, so I need to set desired_sum to 7. Since it's two dice, n_rolls should be 2. The sides_per_die is 6, as a standard die has 6 sides. \n\nWait, the function's parameters: the first parameter is desired_sum, which is required. The second is n_rolls, which is optional. The third is sides_per_die, also required. So I need to pass all three parameters. The user didn't mention n_rolls, so I'll use the default of 1. But wait, when rolling two dice, the default for n_rolls is 1, but the function's parameters might have that as optional. Let me check again. The function's parameters for dice_roll_probability have n_rolls as required? Wait, looking back: the params section for dice_roll_probability says n_rolls is required \"false\".

That means it's optional. So if the user doesn't specify, we use the default of 1. But the user is asking for a single roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. Wait, but the function's parameters for n_rolls are required \"false\". So the function can take n_rolls as optional.
