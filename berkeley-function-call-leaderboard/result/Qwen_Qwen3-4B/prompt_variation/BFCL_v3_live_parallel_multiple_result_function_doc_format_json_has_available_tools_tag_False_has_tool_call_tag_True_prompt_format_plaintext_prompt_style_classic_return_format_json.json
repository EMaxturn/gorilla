The user wants to modify two things: their food order and their drink order. \n\nFirst, for the food part: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be none, but maybe \"without anchovies\" is part of the specialInstructions? Wait, the function's specialInstructions field is for things like 'extra spicy' or 'no salt'. So maybe the user's request is already covered by removeIngredients. But the user explicitly says \"without anchovies\", so perhaps it's better to include that in specialInstructions. But looking at the function's parameters, removeIngredients is for ingredients to remove. So maybe the user's request is to remove anchovies, so that's handled by removeIngredients. The specialInstructions might not be needed here. But the user might want to specify that the salad is without anchovies, so maybe include that in specialInstructions. Hmm, but the function's parameters have separate fields for newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. So perhaps the correct approach is to set foodItem to \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients to \"anchovies\", and maybe specialInstructions to \"without anchovies\" if needed. But the function's description says that ChaFod is for modifying ingredients or preparation method. So removing anchovies is part of the ingredients. So the removeIngredients parameter is the right place for that. So the parameters for ChaFod would be foodItem: \"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients: \"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order: the user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink is for modifying drinks. The parameters required are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences should include size: \"large\", temperature: \"hot\", sweetness_level: \"regular\", milk_type: \"almond\". The special_instructions parameter is optional and not mentioned here, so it can be left as default. So the new_preferences dictionary would have those four keys.\n\nSo two function calls are needed: one to ChaFod with the food changes, and another to ChaDri.change_drink with the drink details."}

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I'll need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url and destination. The user didn't specify a destination, so the default is the current directory. I'll set repo_url to the given URL and leave destination as '.'.\n\nNext step is to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function is needed, which requires the directory_name. Since the repo was cloned into the current directory, the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' or maybe the current directory. Wait, the function's parameter is the directory name relative to the root. So after cloning, the directory is probably 'nodejs-welcome', so I'll use that as the directory_name.\n\nThen, based on the analysis, create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. For the Dockerfile, the create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. The same directory as the repo, so 'nodejs-welcome'. For Kubernetes, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use defaults. Deployment name defaults to the directory name, image_name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\nAfter creating these files, the user wants to add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The directory is the same as before. The commit message is 'Update changes' by default, branch is 'main', and force_push is False unless specified. The user didn't mention force pushing, so default is okay.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a typo for \"add all changed files to git\" (like git add). However, the available functions don't have a git add function. The push_git_changes_to_github function does git add automatically, so maybe that's the one to use. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. So maybe after creating the files, we need to run git add, then commit, then push. However, the available functions are clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and push_git_changes_to_github. The push function does git add, commit, and push. So perhaps the user's step 3 is covered by the push function. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a separate step. However, since the push function includes adding changes, maybe that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to first add the files, then commit and push. But the available functions don't have a separate add step. So the push function might handle adding, committing, and pushing. So the steps would be: clone, analyze, create docker and k8s files, then push.\n\nSo the functions to call are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', using defaults for other parameters\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', default commit message and branch.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be a separate step. However, the available functions don't have a git add function. The push_git_changes_to_github function does git add, so maybe that's the correct function to use. So the steps would be:\n\nAfter creating the files, call push_git_changes_to_github to add, commit, and push. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then step 4 is to commit and push. However, the push function does both. So the correct sequence is:\n\nclone, analyze, create docker, create k8s, then push.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nNow, checking parameters for each function.\n\nFor clone_repo: repo_url is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, destination is default '.'.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the repo is cloned into that directory).\n\ncreate_a_docker_file: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome', deployment_name defaults to 'nodejs-welcome', image_name 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github: directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message 'Update changes', branch 'main', force_push False.\n\nSo the JSON for the tool calls would be:\n\n[\n  {\"function\": \"clone_repo\", \"parameters\": {\"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}}\n]"}

The user wants classes related to 'CellResult', so I should call that function with 'search_string' set to 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories set to True since they mentioned including subdirectories.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function requires the class name and method name. Since they're asking for both methods, I'll need to call 'get_signature' twice: once for each method. The class name is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The 'include_private' parameter is optional and defaults to False, so unless the user specifies private methods, we can leave it as default.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention anything about private methods, so it's safe to use the default. Also, the 'get_signature' function requires both class_name and method_name as required parameters.
