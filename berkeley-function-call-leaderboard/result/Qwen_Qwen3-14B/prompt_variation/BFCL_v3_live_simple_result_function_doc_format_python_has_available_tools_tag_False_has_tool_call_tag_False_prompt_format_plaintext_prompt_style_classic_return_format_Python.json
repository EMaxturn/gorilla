The base URL from the function's example is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67 gives the base URL part.\n\nNext, the parameters. The user mentioned node ID 12, pod 10, and Network1 fabric. But the function's params are a dictionary. However, the example doesn't specify what parameters are expected. Wait, the function's description says the params are query parameters for the request. But the user's question includes node ID, pod, and fabric, which might be part of the URL path or query parameters. However, the example URL in the function's args doesn't include those parameters. Maybe the API expects certain query parameters. But since the function's parameters are not detailed beyond the example, I need to infer based on the user's question.\n\nWait, the user's question might be missing some parameters required by the API. For instance, if the API requires parameters like 'node_id', 'pod', 'fabric', or 'interface_type' (like Ethernet), but the function's parameters aren't specified beyond the example. The example given in the function's args shows a URL without query parameters, but the params argument is a dict. So perhaps the API expects query parameters such as 'node_id', 'pod_id', 'fabric_name', and 'interface_type'.\n\nBut the user's question specifies node ID 12, pod 10, Network1 fabric, and Ethernet interface. So the params should include these. However, the function's parameters aren't explicitly defined, so I have to assume that the API expects these parameters. Therefore, the params dictionary would be something like {'node_id': 12, 'pod': 10, 'fabric': 'Network1', 'interface_type': 'Ethernet'}.\n\nBut wait, the original URL example in the function's args is for 'interfaceInfo', which might already be the endpoint for interface statistics. So maybe the parameters needed are node_id, pod, fabric, and interface_type. However, without knowing the exact API parameters, this is an assumption. But given the user's question, these are the parameters they provided. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the URL would be constructed with the IP, and the params would include the node ID, pod, fabric, and interface type. Therefore, the function call would be requests.get with the URL and the params as specified."}
