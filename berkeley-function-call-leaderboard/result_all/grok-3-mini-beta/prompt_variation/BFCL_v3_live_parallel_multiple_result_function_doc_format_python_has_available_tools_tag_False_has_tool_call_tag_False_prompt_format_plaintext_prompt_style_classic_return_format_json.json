Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n2. Stop the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, I need to see which one matches this.\n\nThe relevant function is: ControlAppliance.execute\n\nThis function is for controlling home appliances.

The user has given commands in this format, but they've combined two commands into one sentence.\n\nI need to make function calls. The function expects one command per call, based on the description.\n\nThe function's args: command (str) \u2013 It's a single string with the command.\n\nSo, for each separate command, I should make a separate function call.\n\nThe user has two commands:\n\n1.

Get the weather in Seoul, South Korea using Celsius units.\n\n2. Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n3. Find up-to-date information on the Imjin War.\n\nI need to handle these using the available functions.\n\nLet's match each request to the appropriate function:\n\n- For the weather: The function \"OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\" is perfect. It takes a location like 'Seoul, South Korea' and units as 'metric' for Celsius.\n\n- For turning on the air conditioner: The function \"ControlAppliance.execute\" is for controlling appliances. The command must be in Korean. The example given is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' which means 'living room, air conditioner, execute' or turn on. So, I need to translate \"turn on the air conditioner in the living room\" to Korean as per the function's requirements.\n\n- For information on the Imjin War: This seems like a historical topic, but the user asked for \"up-to-date information.\" The Imjin War is from the 16th century, so it's not something that changes frequently. However, the function \"HNA_WQA.search\" is for web searches on topics that change frequently, like current events. There's also \"HNA_NEWS.search\" for news. I should use \"HNA_WQA.search\" since it's for general web searches, and the user specified \"up-to-date information,\" which might mean recent discussions or analyses.\n\nThe function descriptions:\n\n- HNA_WQA.search: For topics that change frequently, like current president, recent movies. The Imjin War isn't current, but perhaps the user means recent news related to it, like anniversaries or modern interpretations.\n\n- HNA_NEWS.search: Specifically for news articles.\n\nSince the user said \"up-to-date information,\" I'll go with HNA_WQA.search for a general web search.\n\nNow, about the format: I need to output only the function calls in the specified JSON format. I can make multiple function calls in one response, as a list.\n\nFor ControlAppliance.execute, the command must be in Korean. So, for \"turn on the air conditioner in the living room,\" it should be something like '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'. Let me confirm:\n\n- Living room: \uac70\uc2e4\n\n- Air conditioner: \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8\n\n- Turn on: as per the function, 'power on' or 'start', and in the example, '\uc2e4\ud589' is used, which means 'execute' or 'run'.\n\nThe function description says: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nIt also says: \"the command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name, and operation command, separated by commas.\"\n\nAnd examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nSo, I need to use '\uc2e4\ud589' or equivalent. I'll use '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' as in the example.\n\nFor the weather function:\n\n- location: 'Seoul, South Korea'\n\n- units: 'metric'\n\nFor HNA_WQA.search:\n\n- keyword: Something like 'Imjin War'\n\n- The user didn't specify language or other params, so I'll use defaults.\n\nI need to make sure I call all necessary functions in this response.\n\nSo, in this turn, I'll call all three functions.\n\nOutput format: Exactly as specified, a JSON array of objects, each with \"function\" and \"parameters\".\n\nFinal function calls:\n\n1. OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather with location='Seoul, South Korea', units='metric'\n\n2. ControlAppliance.execute with command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\n3. HNA_WQA.search with keyword='Imjin War' (I'll use English as default, but perhaps specify language if needed; default is 'EN')\n\nThe function for HNA_WQA.search has language default 'EN', which is fine.\n\nAlright, let's structure the response:\n\n[\n\n{\"function\": \"OpenWeatherMap.get_current_weather\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"Seoul, South Korea\", \"units\": \"metric\"} },\n\n{\"function\": \"ControlAppliance.execute\", \"parameters\": {\"command\": \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\"} },\n\n{\"function\": \"HNA_WQA.search\", \"parameters\": {\"keyword\": \"Imjin War\"} }\n\n]\n\nThat seems correct."}

Clone the repo: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n\n2. Analyze the contents of the repo.\n\n3. Based on the analysis:\n\n   - Create or update a Dockerfile.\n\n   - Create Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n4. Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n5. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI need to map these steps to the available functions:\n\n- clone_repo: This matches step 1. It takes repo_url, and optionally destination, recursive, depth.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This matches step 2. It takes directory_name.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This is for step 2.1. It takes directory_name.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This is for step 2.2. It takes directory_name, and other parameters.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This is for steps 4 and 5, but it also handles adding changes automatically. The description says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, it can handle step 3 (add all changed files) as part of pushing.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says: \"Pushes all changes from a local Git repository to the associated GitHub remote repository. This function will automatically git add all changes.\"\n\nSo, when I call push_git_changes_to_github, it will first git add all, then commit, and push.\n\nThat covers steps 3, 4, and 5.\n\nHowever, the order is important. I need to do the analysis and create files first, then add and push.\n\nSo, the sequence should be:\n\n1. Call clone_repo to clone the repo.\n\n2. After cloning, call analyse_repo_contents.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, call create_a_docker_file.\n\n4. Then, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n5. Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github to add, commit, and push the changes.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI need to output all necessary function calls in this response, as a list.\n\nThe functions depend on each other. For example, I need to analyze first before creating files, but the create functions don't directly depend on the analysis output; I just need to call them after analysis.\n\nIn this setup, I have to assume that the system will execute the functions in sequence based on what I output.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nFor now, I should output all the function calls in one go.\n\nLooking at the required format: I can output a list of function calls in a single response.\n\nSo, I'll list them in the order they need to be executed.\n\nParameters:\n\nFor clone_repo:\n\n- repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n- I can use defaults for others.\n\nFor analyse_repo_contents:\n\n- directory_name: After cloning, the repo will be in the current directory or specified one. By default, it's '.'. So, if I clone to '.', the directory_name could be the repo name, but the function expects \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nFor clone_repo, if destination is '.', it clones into the current directory, probably into a folder with the repo name.\n\nTo be precise, let's assume it clones into a directory named after the repo, like 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe function description: \"The local file system path where the repository should be cloned to. If omitted, the repository is cloned into the current working directory.\"\n\nIf I set destination to '.', it might clone into './nodejs-welcome' or something. I need to specify.\n\nIn Git, cloning a repo like that will create a new directory with the repo name unless you specify.\n\nTo make it simple, I'll assume we clone to '.', and then the directory_name for analysis is the repo name.\n\nThe user said: \"clone the repo git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\nI should use destination as '.' or perhaps the repo name. To be safe, I'll use the default.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file and others, it takes directory_name, which is \"The name of the repository directory where the Dockerfile will be created.\"\n\nSo, probably, for a cloned repo, it's the path to that directory.\n\nLet's say, after cloning, the directory is 'nodejs-welcome', so I'll use that as directory_name.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so likely the directory will be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nI'll use 'nodejs-welcome' as directory_name for the subsequent functions.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it takes directory_name, which is \"The name of the directory where the repo is located. This will be used to name the Kubernetes deployment and service.\"\n\nSo, same as above.\n\nIt has other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so I'll use defaults.\n\nFinally, for push_git_changes_to_github, it takes directory_name, which should be 'nodejs-welcome', commit_message, etc. I'll use defaults.\n\nSo, the function calls in order:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' (and defaults for others)\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\nI need to output this as a JSON list.\n\nFormat: ```json [ {\"function\": \"func_name1\", \"parameters\": {...}}, ... ] ```\n\nSo, something like:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"function\": \"clone_repo\", \"parameters\": {\"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}}\n]\n```\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nOne potential issue: For create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it might need more parameters, but since the user said \"based on the analysis,\" and the function has defaults, I'll proceed.\n\nI think that's all."}

However, the function's filter is for after 2022, so I need to phrase the prompt accordingly.\n\n  - The user said \"since October 2021\" but then \"Include only information published after the year 2022\".

That sounds perfect for finding information from previous conversations.\n\n- archival_memory_insert: For adding to archival memory.\n\n- archival_memory_search: For searching archival memory, which is semantic search, but the user specified \"previous conversations,\" which might be in recall_memory.\n\n- http_request: For making external HTTP requests, not relevant.\n\nSo, for the first part: \"Find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations,\" I should use recall_memory_search. I need to search for something related to Shishir's birthday.\n\nThe function requires a 'query' string. I could use a query like \"Shishir's birthday\" or something similar.\n\nAfter searching, I need to congratulate him regardless. That means, even if I don't find the birthday, I should still send the message.\n\nThe user said \"find out... and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless.\" So, I need to perform the search first, and then send the message.\n\nIn this system, I have to output function calls one at a time. The instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nI might need to call recall_memory_search first to get the information, and then based on that, call send_message. But I can't make decisions based on the response in this setup; I have to output all function calls I think are needed.\n\nThe format allows me to output multiple function calls in one response, like a list.\n\nOnce I output functions, the system will execute them and then come back.\n\nTo fulfill the request: I need to search first, then send the message.\n\nThe send_message should happen regardless, so I should include both in my response.\n\nThe exact wording: \"find out... and then congratulate him... regardless\"\n\n\"Regardless\" probably means send the message even if I don't find the info.\n\nIn practice, I need to call the search function and then the send function.\n\nFor send_message, I need parameters: message, recipient, and optional urgent.\n\nThe message should be 'Happy Birthday!' but to whom? The user said \"Shishir\", so recipient should be 'Shishir' or something. The function says: recipient (str, default='default@example.com'), so I need to specify it.\n\nThe function description: \"The identifier of the recipient. This could be a username, phone number, or an email address.\"\n\nI don't know the exact identifier for Shishir. The user just said \"Shishir\", so I'll assume it's a username or something. I should use 'Shishir' as the recipient.\n\nFor the search: recall_memory_search requires 'query', and optional 'page' and 'request_heartbeat'.\n\nI should set query to something like \"Shishir birthday\" or \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nAfter searching, I need to send the message. But in my response, I can call both functions at once.\n\nThe instructions: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nIn one response, I can output a list of functions.\n\nTo be precise, I should first call the search, and then in a subsequent turn, call send_message based on the result. But the system might not work that way; I think I need to output all at once if possible.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, I should output both.\n\nPerhaps call recall_memory_search with request_heartbeat true, so it can trigger the next action.\n\nFor send_message, I don't need to wait; it's regardless.\n\nThe safest is to output two function calls: first, recall_memory_search, and second, send_message.\n\nThat way, both will be executed.\n\nOrder might matter. If I call send_message first, it will send before searching.\n\nIn the JSON format, it's a list, so probably executed in order.\n\nI'll assume they are executed in the order I provide.\n\nSo, plan: First, call recall_memory_search to find the info, then call send_message to congratulate.\n\nFor recall_memory_search:\n\n- query: \"Shishir's birthday\"\n\n- page: 0 (default)\n\n- request_heartbeat: Maybe true, to allow follow-up, but since I'm calling another function, perhaps not necessary.\n\nIn my response, I can just list both.\n\nFinally, output in the exact format.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n[\n\n{\"function\": \"recall_memory_search\", \"parameters\": {\"query\": \"Shishir's birthday\", \"page\": 0}},\n\n{\"function\": \"send_message\", \"parameters\": {\"message\": \"Happy Birthday!\", \"recipient\": \"Shishir\"}}\n\n]\n\nThat seems right.\n\nIs \"Shishir\" the correct recipient? Probably, as it's the identifier given.\n\nI didn't set urgent, so it defaults to False.\n\nFor message_chatgpt or others, not needed.\n\nOne more thing: The user said \"from our previous conversations,\" which aligns with recall_memory_search.\n\nAlright, I think that's it."}

I can use this for the second part.\n\nFor the first part: \"Find the highest common factor for 36 and 48\"\n\n- I can call math_gcd with a=48 (since it says the first should be larger) and b=36.\n\nThe function description says: \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\"\n\nIs 48 larger than 36? Yes, so a=48, b=36.\n\nFor the second part: \"how steep the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 is at x = 5\"\n\n- This requires estimating the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x=5.\n\n- The function estimate_derivative needs:\n\n  - function: A callable object for f(x) = x^2.\n\n  - x: 5\n\n  - dx: optional, default 0.0001\n\n  - method: optional, default 'central'\n\nI need to provide a callable object for the function. In the context of this system, I have to assume that I can pass a string or something, but the function description says \"function (any): The mathematical function... provided as a callable object.\"\n\nIn this setup, I'm composing function calls, and I might not be able to directly pass a Python lambda. The instructions don't specify how to handle this. Looking back: \"function (any): The mathematical function for which the derivative is to be estimated, provided as a callable object.\"\n\nThis is a problem. In the response format, I have to provide JSON with parameters, and \"any\" might not translate well. But in the context of this exercise, I think I need to assume that I can pass a string representation or something, but the function expects a callable.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor estimate_derivative, I need to provide a callable for 'function'. But in my response, I'm just writing JSON, so how do I provide a callable? This might be an issue.\n\nPerhaps in this simulated environment, I can represent it as a string, like \"lambda x: x**2\", but the function description specifies \"provided as a callable object\", which implies it's executed in code.\n\nI need to point out that I can't provide a callable directly in this format.\n\nThe instructions: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor estimate_derivative, the question provides the function as f(x) = x^2, but I need to pass it as a parameter. In my function call, I have to specify it in JSON, so I could try to pass it as a string.\n\nTo be precise, let's see if I can make the call.\n\nI should proceed by calling both functions as best as I can.\n\nFirst, call math_gcd for the GCD.\n\nSecond, for estimate_derivative, I need to pass the function. I'll assume I can pass it as a string for now, like {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\"} or something, but that's not accurate.\n\nThe function arg is \"function (any)\", so in JSON, I can put a string.\n\nIn many APIs, functions are passed as strings.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\nMy response should be a list of function calls.\n\nThe user has two tasks, so I need to make two function calls in one response, as per: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nI can call both in this turn.\n\nFormat: ```json [ {\"function\": \"math_gcd\", \"parameters\": {\"a\": 48, \"b\": 36}}, {\"function\": \"estimate_derivative\", \"parameters\": {\"function\": \"lambda x: x**2\", \"x\": 5}} ] ```\n\nIs \"lambda x: x**2\" a valid way?

So, I'll stick to what's asked.\n\nFinal function calls:\n\n1. Events_3_FindEvents with appropriate parameters.\n\n2. Buses_3_FindBus with appropriate parameters."}

The booking is for a specific salon, but the search is for Sunnyvale, CA.

It takes:\n\n   - name (str): The full name of the user's client.\n\n   - status (str, default='active'): The status of the mandates.\n\n   This seems relevant because the user specified particular names.\n\n2. **partner.mandates**: This function fetches mandates for a partner based on status. It doesn't take a user name; it just takes a status or defaults to all.\n\n   This one is for partners, not for specific users, so it might not be directly useful here since the query is about specific users.\n\nThe user wants mandates for two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\", and for statuses: pending and active.\n\nThe function user.mandates allows specifying a status, but it's per call. I might need to call it multiple times: once for each user and for each status.\n\nThe function's default status is 'active', and I can specify 'pending' or others.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active\", so for each user, I need both pending and active mandates.\n\nPossible calls:\n\n- For user \"parath\", status 'active'\n\n- For user \"parath\", status 'pending'\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status 'active'\n\n- For user \"bhanu\", status 'pending'\n\nI have to make one or more function calls in my response.
