The modification_request is \"no onions,extra cheese\" \u2013 the user specified verbatim, so I should keep the comma without space. Wait, the function's param description says to separate multiple requests with comma and no space. The user's input has \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space after the comma. Do I need to adjust that? The function's instruction says to use comma with no space between. But the user's request is verbatim. Hmm, but the function's parameter expects the modification_request to be formatted with commas and no space. However, the user's input includes a space. Should I follow the user's exact wording or format it as per the function's requirement?\n\nWait, the function's param says: \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So the modification_request should be formatted with commas and no space. But the user's input has \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space. Should I modify it to \"no onions,extra cheese\" when passing to the function? Or is the function able to handle spaces? The function's description says the modification_request is a specific request detailing changes, so maybe the user's exact wording is acceptable. However, the function's parameter expects the format with commas and no space. But the user's instruction says to use the modification verbatim. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the user says \"modification verbatim: no onions, extra cheese\". So they want the exact text. But the function's parameter expects the modification_request to be formatted with commas and no space. However, the function's parameter description says that if there are multiple requests, separate with comma and no space. So maybe the function can handle both cases, but the correct way is to format it as per the function's requirement. However, the user's input is verbatim, so perhaps I should pass it as is. But the function might expect the comma without space. This is a bit ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can process the modification_request even if there's a space after the comma. The function's parameter is a string, so it's up to the function's implementation. Since the user specified verbatim, I should pass exactly what they wrote. So the modification_request would be \"no onions, extra cheese\". Even though there's a space after the comma, the function might still process it correctly. Therefore, the correct function call would be change_food with food_item \"burger\" and modification_request \"no onions, extra cheese\"."}

The url should be the base endpoint without query parameters, and params is a dictionary of query parameters.\n\nThe user's parameters include fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType.

The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', but I need to confirm if that's the correct path for the user's API name. Since the user's API is to get interface info, maybe that's the right endpoint. However, the example URL has 'flowrules/interfaceInfo', which might be specific to that API. The user's parameters don't include flowrules, so maybe the URL should be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the example is just an example and the actual path is different. But since the user hasn't provided the exact URL path, I have to use the example structure but replace {ip} with the given IP.\n\nSo, constructing the URL: https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo. Then, the params dictionary should include the user's parameters. Let me check if all parameters are required. The function's params require 'params' as a dict, which is required. The user provided fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, infoType. These should be included in the params. The parameter names in the function's example might be different, but the user's parameters are specific. So, the params would be:\n\n{\n  \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n  \"nodeId\": 12,\n  \"podId\": 10,\n  \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n  \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n}\n\nWait, but the function's parameters for the 'params' field are a dict, so the keys should match what the API expects. The user's parameters are the ones the API requires. So, assuming that the API expects these exact parameter names, the function call would use them. Therefore, the tool call would be to requests.get with the constructed URL and the params as the dictionary above.\n\nI need to make sure that the URL is correctly formatted with the IP and the path. The example in the function's description uses 'sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', but maybe there's a typo with 'api/api'? The user's version is 6.3.1, but the function's example might be for a different version. However, since the user hasn't provided the exact URL path, I have to go with the example given, replacing {ip} with the provided IP. So the URL would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nTherefore, the function call is to use requests.get with that URL and the params as specified.
