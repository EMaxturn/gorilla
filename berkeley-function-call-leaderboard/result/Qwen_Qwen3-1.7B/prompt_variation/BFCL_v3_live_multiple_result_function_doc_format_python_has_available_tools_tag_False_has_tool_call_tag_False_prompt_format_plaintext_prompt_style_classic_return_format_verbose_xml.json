They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank from October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and the account holder is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The beginning balance was $5,532.01, ending balance $6,737.37. There were other deposits of $7,132.76 and withdrawals of $5,927.40. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user provided the bank name, account number, account type (checking), full name, and the starting and ending balances, as well as total deposits and withdrawals. But the transaction_overview is a dict, which the user hasn't provided. However, they mentioned the beginning and ending balances and the total deposits and withdrawals. Maybe the transaction_overview can be calculated using the TotalTransactions.calculate function. Wait, but the user wants an overview and a summary. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView function's description says it provides an overview including account info and transaction summary. The user also wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions list, dates, and other parameters. But the user hasn't provided the individual transaction details. They only have total deposits and withdrawals. So maybe the transaction_overview can be derived from the given balances and the totals. \n\nBut the BankStatementOverView function's parameters include transaction_overview as a dict, which the user hasn't provided. So perhaps the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is calculated internally. However, the user might need the actual transaction details. But since the user hasn't provided them, maybe the function can be called with the available info, and the transaction_overview is generated based on the totals. \n\nAlternatively, the user might need to use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to get the total transactions, then use that with transaction_summary.generate. But the user's question is about the bank statement overview and a summary. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction_overview (which might be calculated from the given balances and totals). But the transaction_overview is a dict, so maybe the user needs to provide it. However, the user hasn't provided it, so perhaps the function can be called with the available parameters, and the transaction_overview is generated based on the given balances and totals. \n\nWait, the user provided the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. So the total transactions would be deposits plus withdrawals. The net change would be (7132.76 - 5927.40) = 1205.36. The starting balance is 5532.01, ending is 6737.37. So the net change is 1205.36, which matches the ending balance. \n\nBut the transaction_overview in the BankStatementOverView function is a dict that includes totals and counts. So maybe the function can be called with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview is calculated as the sum of deposits and withdrawals, along with the counts. \n\nSo, the function call would be BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. The user's account details are: bank_name='U.S. Bank', account_number='1-523-1713-5704', account_type='checking', full_name='SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING', and transaction_overview which is a dict. But the user hasn't provided the transaction_overview, so maybe the function can be called with the other parameters and the transaction_overview is generated internally. \n\nAlternatively, the user might need to use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to get the total transactions, then use transaction_summary.generate with the transactions list. But the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the best approach is to call BankStatementOverView with the available parameters, and the transaction_overview is assumed to be calculated from the given balances and totals. The user might need to provide the transaction_overview, but since they didn't, perhaps the function can be called with the other parameters and the transaction_overview is generated as part of the function's processing. \n\nSo, the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"BankStatementOverView\"><params><param name=\"bank_name\" value=\"U.S. Bank\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"account_number\" value=\"1-523-1713-5704\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"account_type\" value=\"checking\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"full_name\" value=\"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\" type=\"string\"/></params></function>\n\nThen, the transaction_overview would be calculated based on the given balances and totals. The user also wants a summary of transactions, which might be handled by the BankStatementOverView function's output. However, the user might need to call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions list, but since the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the main function call is BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, and the transaction_overview is derived from the given data."}

The question is about movies playing today in Noida, so maybe get_movies can be used if we assume a default cinema hall. But the user didn't mention a specific cinema hall.

However, the user might be interested in all movies in Noida, but the function might need more parameters.\n\nWait, the user's question is about movies playing today in Noida. The get_show_times function requires movie_name, which the user hasn't provided. So maybe get_show_times isn't the right choice here. The get_movies function can retrieve a list of movies in a city, but it needs the movie_date. The user mentioned \"today,\" so the movie_date should be set to today's date, which is Nov 4, 2024 in India. The city is Noida, and the cinema_hall is not specified. The default for cinema_hall in get_movies is an empty string, so maybe we can omit it.\n\nBut the get_movies function's parameters include city, cinema_hall, movie_date, language, and format.

However, the function's movie_date parameter accepts values like 'today', 'tomorrow', etc. So maybe the movie_date can be 'today'. But the function's description says the date is formatted as 'DD-MM-YYYY', so maybe the user's input is 'today' and the function expects a specific format. Hmm, the function's parameters for movie_date say it's formatted as 'DD-MM-YYYY', so perhaps the user's input of 'today' is not directly usable. But the system says to use the current date (Nov 4, 2024) as the movie date. So the movie_date should be '04 Nov 2024'.\n\nSo, the function call would be get_movies with city='Noida', movie_date='04 Nov 2024', and the other parameters as default. But the user didn't specify cinema_hall or language/format, so those can be defaults. However, the get_movies function's default for cinema_hall is an empty string, so it's okay to omit it. Therefore, the function call would be get_movies with city='Noida' and movie_date='04 Nov 2024'.\n\nBut wait, the user might be interested in specific cinema halls. Since the user didn't mention any, maybe we can't include cinema_hall. So the function call is get_movies with the required parameters. The other parameters like language and format can be defaults.

The user specified the prompt as 'the current prime minister of India' and wants info after 2022. So I should set include_after_year to True. The source can stay as default, which is Google. \n\nWait, the function's default for include_after_year is False, so I need to set it to True to ensure the results are from after 2022.

The other parameters like include_financials are not mentioned in the question, so they can be set to default False. The date_format might also be default, but the user didn't specify, so it's safe to leave it as default.\n\nI don't need to use any other functions because the question is specifically about this project's details.

That function exports the VEX information for a project in CycloneDX format. The parameters required are uuid and download.

The user hasn't specified the city. So I can't call the function without that. The function requires place_name, which is the hotel's name. But the user hasn't provided that.

So the function call would be RentalCars_3_GetCarsAvailable with city='Portland, OR', start_date='2023-04-22', pickup_time='10:00', end_date='2023-04-27'. \n\nI need to make sure the dates are correctly formatted. The start date is April 22, 2023, so '2023-04-22' and end date is April 27, 2023, so '2023-04-27'. The pickup time is 10:00 AM, which is '10:00' in 24-hour format. \n\nNo other functions seem relevant here. The user isn't asking about flights or buses, so the RentalCars_3_GetCarsAvailable is the right choice."}

They want to find songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic' and also explore tracks from six years ago, which is 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's Music_3_LookupMusic, which can find songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The parameters include artist, album, genre, and year. The user mentioned the album 'The New Classic', so I should use that as the album parameter. They also want tracks from six years ago, which would be 2017. But the function's year parameter is a four-digit number, so 2017 is correct. \n\nWait, the user said \"six years ago\" but the current year is 2023, so 2023 - 6 = 2017. That's right. So the year parameter should be 2017. \n\nBut the user also wants songs similar to those on the album. The Music_3_LookupMusic function doesn't mention anything about similarity. The function's description says it finds songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. So maybe the user is expecting to use the album parameter here. However, the function's default for album is 'dontcare', so if they specify the album, it will search for songs in that album. But the user wants songs similar to those on the album, which might require a different approach. But since the available functions don't have a function for finding similar songs, maybe the user is expecting to use the album parameter in the LookupMusic function. \n\nSo, the first function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'The New Classic' and year set to 2017. That would find songs from 2017 that are part of the album. Then, the user wants to explore tracks from six years ago, which is 2017. So the same year parameter would be used. \n\nWait, but the user said \"tracks released around six years ago\" which is 2017. So the year parameter is 2017. The album parameter is 'The New Classic'. So the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. \n\nBut the user also wants songs similar to those on the album. Since there's no function for similar songs, maybe the user is expecting to use the album parameter again. However, the function's default for album is 'dontcare', so if the user specifies the album, it will search for songs in that album. But the user wants similar songs, which might not be directly possible with the given functions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting to use the album parameter in the LookupMusic function to find songs from that album, and then use the year parameter to find tracks from six years ago. But the user's request is to find songs similar to those on the album and explore tracks from six years ago. Since the functions don't have a way to find similar songs, perhaps the answer is to call LookupMusic with the album and year parameters as specified. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017' to find songs from 2017 in that album.\n2. Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017' again? Wait, but the user wants to explore tracks from six years ago, which is 2017. So maybe the same year is used. But the user might want to find songs similar to the album, which might require another parameter. However, the available functions don't have a way to find similar songs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to find songs from the album and also from 2017. So the first call is to look up the album and year 2017. Then, the second call is to look up the same album and year again? But that's redundant. \n\nWait, the user's request is to find songs similar to those on the album and explore tracks from six years ago. So the first part is to find songs in the album, and the second part is to find tracks from 2017. But the album parameter is already used in the first call. So maybe the user wants to use the album parameter in the LookupMusic function to find songs from that album, and then use the year parameter to find tracks from 2017. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. Music_3_LookupMusic(album='The New Classic', year='2017') to find songs from 2017 in that album.\n2. Music_3_LookupMusic(album='The New Classic', year='2017') again? Or maybe the user wants to find songs similar to the album, which might require a different approach. But since there's no function for similar songs, perhaps the answer is to call LookupMusic with the album and year parameters as specified. \n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are two instances of Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'. But the user might have intended to find songs similar to the album, but the available functions don't support that. So the answer is to call the LookupMusic function twice with the album and year parameters."}

So the function call would be Payment_1_MakePayment with payment_method as 'debit card', amount 90, receiver 'Alice', and private_visibility False. \n\nI should check if all required parameters are present. The user didn't mention the receiver's details, but the function requires the receiver as a string. The user says \"to Alice\", so assuming Alice is the receiver's identifier. The amount is 90, which is a float. So the function call should be correct."}

The user wants to book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA on May 15, 2023, starting one day before, and include trip protection.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. The function requires _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class.\n\nThe user mentioned 4 business class tickets. The number_of_adults parameter is an integer, so I should set that to 4. The date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, which is \"2023-05-15\". The journey start time is one day before, so that would be May 14, 2023 at 12:00 AM? Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before\". But the journey_start_time is in 24-hour format. So if the date is May 15, the start time would be May 14, but the time is 12:00 AM? Or maybe the user means the journey starts one day before the date, so the date is May 14, and the start time is 12:00 AM? But the function's journey_start_time is in 24-hour format. So the date would be \"2023-05-14\" and the time is \"00:00\".\n\nThen, trip_protection is a boolean, and the user wants it included, so set trip_protection to True. The _class is business class, which in the function's parameters is a string with default 'Value'. So _class should be 'Business' or 'Business Class'.\n\nWait, the function's _class parameter has a default of 'Value', so I need to specify 'Business' or similar. The user said \"business class\", so I'll set _class to 'Business'.\n\nPutting it all together: _from is Portland, OR, to is Seattle, WA, date_of_journey is 2023-05-15, journey_start_time is 23:00 (since one day before, but the user didn't specify time, maybe they mean the start time is the same as the date? Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before, and ensure trip protection is included\". So the date is May 15, and the journey starts one day before, which would be May 14. But the start time is not specified. The user might mean the journey starts on May 14, but the time is not given. However, the function's journey_start_time is in 24-hour format. Since the user didn't specify the time, maybe we can assume it's 12:00 AM? Or maybe the user wants the journey to start at the earliest possible time, but without specific info, perhaps we can set it to 00:00 (midnight) for the date. But the user might have intended the journey to start on May 14, but the time is not specified. However, the function requires the journey_start_time, so maybe the user expects the start time to be the same as the date, but the time is not given. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But since the user didn't specify, maybe we can set the journey_start_time to \"00:00\" as a default. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the journey to start at the same time as the date, but without the time, perhaps the function can handle it. But the function requires the time, so we need to provide it. Since the user didn't specify, maybe we can set it to \"00:00\" as a default.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nTrains_1_GetTrainTickets(\n    _from=\"Portland, OR\",\n    to=\"Seattle, WA\",\n    date_of_journey=\"2023-05-15\",\n    journey_start_time=\"00:00\",\n    number_of_adults=4,\n    trip_protection=True,\n    _class=\"Business\"\n)\n\nI think that's the correct approach. The user didn't specify the start time, but the function requires it. So we have to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15, so the journey starts on May 15. Wait, the user says \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". So the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before. That would be May 14. So the date_of_journey is May 15, and the journey_start_time is May 14. But the function's date_of_journey is the date of the journey, which is May 15. So the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the user wants the journey to start on May 15, but the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. So the function's date_of_journey is the date of the journey, and the journey_start_time is the time of the journey. So if the journey starts on May 15 at 12:00 AM, then the date_of_journey is May 15, and the journey_start_time is \"00:00\". So the function call would be as above."}

The get_service_providers function seems to retrieve a list of service providers based on various criteria, but the user is asking for a specific service provider's profile. The view_service_provider_profile function is designed to retrieve and display the profile information of a specific service provider by their service_id.\n\nThe user provided the UID 1, which I assume is the service_id.

The get_service_providers function seems relevant here. It allows filtering by location (province_id and district_name), availability dates, and has_quality_problem to check for a good reputation. The user mentioned \"good reputation,\" so maybe the has_quality_problem parameter can be set to True. But wait, the function's description says has_quality_problem is a boolean, default False. So if we set it to True, it would indicate if the provider has a record of quality problems. But the user wants a good reputation, so maybe we need to ensure that the provider doesn't have any quality issues. However, the function's parameters don't mention a direct way to filter for good reputation. Maybe the has_quality_problem being False would mean no record of quality problems, which would imply a good reputation. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to exclude providers with quality issues, so setting has_quality_problem to True would filter those out. But the user's question is about finding options with a good reputation, so perhaps the function's parameters can be used to filter based on that.\n\nThe user specified the province_id for Bangkok. The example given for province_id is 1 for Bangkok, 2 for Chiang Mai. So I need to set province_id to 1. The district_name is Chatuchak. The start_available_date is March 22nd, 2024. The function's parameters accept start_available_date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format. So I need to format that date as 2024-03-22 00:00:00. The user didn't mention any other specific criteria, so other parameters like min_age, max_age, etc., are not specified, so they can be left as default or null.\n\nSo the function call would be get_service_providers with avg_rating set to a value that indicates a good reputation. Wait, the avg_rating is a float, but the user hasn't specified a particular rating. However, the function's description says that avg_rating is the average review rating. If the user wants a good reputation, maybe they expect a higher rating. But since the user hasn't specified a particular rating, perhaps we can set avg_rating to a value like 4.5 or 5.0. But the user might not have that info, so maybe the function can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function's parameters allow for a default value. However, the user's question is to find options with a good reputation, so perhaps the has_quality_problem should be set to False to exclude providers with quality issues. Wait, but the user wants a good reputation, so maybe the has_quality_problem should be False. But the function's parameters don't have a direct way to set a good reputation. Maybe the function's default is to include providers without quality problems, which would be a good reputation. So perhaps setting has_quality_problem to False would mean that the provider doesn't have a record of quality problems, which is a good reputation. But the user might want to ensure that the provider is good, so maybe the function's parameters can be used to filter based on that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function call would include province_id=1, district_name='Chatuchak', start_available_date='2024-03-22 00:00:00', and has_quality_problem=False. The avg_rating could be set to a value like 4.5, but since the user hasn't specified, maybe it's better to leave it as a default or not set it. However, the function's parameters require avg_rating to be a float. If the user doesn't specify, maybe we can leave it as null, but the function's description says that avg_rating is 'null' for unrated. But the user wants a good reputation, so maybe we need to set avg_rating to a value that indicates a good rating. However, without specific info, perhaps the function can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with the function returning providers with a good reputation based on the available parameters. So the function call would be get_service_providers with the specified parameters.\n\nAnother thing: the user mentioned \"available on the 22nd of March, 2024\". The start_available_date is set to that date, and end_available_date is 'null' if open-ended. So the start_available_date is set to 2024-03-22 00:00:00, and end_available_date is null.\n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nget_service_providers(avg_rating=4.5, province_id=1, district_name='Chatuchak', start_available_date='2024-03-22 00:00:00', has_quality_problem=False)\n\nBut the user didn't specify the avg_rating, so maybe it's better to leave it as a default.

So maybe the function can be called with avg_rating as a default, but the user's question is to find options with a good reputation. So perhaps the function's default is to include providers with a good reputation. But the function's description says that avg_rating is 'null' for unrated. So if the user wants a good reputation, maybe the avg_rating should be set to a value higher than 0, but without knowing the exact value, it's hard to say. However, the user might not have that info, so maybe the function can be called with avg_rating as a default, but the function's parameters require it.

Alternatively, maybe the service_ids parameter can be set to include ironing services. However, the function's description says service_ids are identifiers like 1 for cleaning, 2 for ironing, etc. So if the user wants ironing, maybe the service_id is 2. But the user didn't mention a specific ID, so maybe the function can be called with service_ids as [2] to filter for ironing services. \n\nBut the user didn't specify the service ID, so perhaps the function can be called with service_ids=[2] if that's the ID for ironing. Alternatively, maybe the function allows filtering by service name, but the parameters don't include a service name. The function's parameters are more about attributes like ratings, province, district, etc. So maybe the service_ids is the way to go. \n\nSo, the function call would be get_service_providers with service_ids set to [2] (assuming 2 is the ID for ironing). But the user didn't specify the service ID, so maybe the function can be called with service_ids as [2] if that's the correct ID.

Wait, the user's question doesn't mention the alert_type, so maybe I need to assume it's 'error_rate' or perhaps it's not required. But according to the function's parameters, alert_type is a required argument. So the user must have provided it. Wait, the user's question says \"error rate threshold of 5%\", but the function requires alert_type. So maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' by default. But the user didn't specify it. Hmm, this is a problem. But the user's question is to set up the configuration, so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' by default. So I can proceed with that.\n\nSo the parameters would be: name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05 (since 5% is 0.05 as a float), recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], enabled=True. The user didn't mention enabled, but the default is True, so maybe it's okay to leave it as default.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The other parameters are filled in. So the function call should be made with those values."}

The user needs all API tokens now, and their user ID is 12345. Looking at the available functions, there are two related to API tokens: get_shareable_api_tokens and get_api_tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens function takes a user_id and an include_revoked flag, but the user wants all tokens, not just shareable ones. The get_api_tokens function is more general, allowing parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. Since the user didn't specify any particular filters, using get_api_tokens makes sense. However, the get_api_tokens function's default page is 1 and page_size is 20. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe we need to fetch multiple pages. Wait, the function's page parameter is an integer, defaulting to 1. If the user wants all tokens, we might need to loop through multiple pages. But the problem is, the user might not know how many pages there are. However, the function allows specifying page and page_size. The maximum page_size is 100. So, if the user wants all tokens, we can set page_size to 100 and fetch as many pages as needed. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the best approach is to call get_api_tokens with the default parameters and then check if more pages are needed. But the user asked for \"all\" tokens, so perhaps we need to call it multiple times. However, the system might expect a single function call. Wait, the functions are supposed to be called in a way that covers all tokens. But the get_api_tokens function's page and page_size parameters can be adjusted. So, the user's request is to retrieve all tokens, so we can call get_api_tokens with page=1 and page_size=100, and then maybe another call with page=2, but the user might not know. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So, maybe the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with the default parameters, but the user might need to handle multiple pages. But the problem is that the user's request is to \"get all\" tokens, so the assistant should call the function with the parameters that would retrieve all possible tokens. However, the function's page_size is 20 by default. So, if the user wants all, the assistant might need to call it multiple times. But since the assistant can only make one function call per turn, perhaps the answer is to call get_api_tokens with the default parameters, assuming that the page_size is 20 and the user wants all, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should call get_api_tokens with page=1 and page_size=100, and then in the next turn, call again with page=2, but the user might not have that. However, the user's question is to \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So, the assistant needs to make a function call that retrieves all tokens. But the get_api_tokens function's parameters don't include a way to get all tokens in one call. The page_size is 20, so the assistant can't get all in one call unless they adjust page_size to 100. So, the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with page=1 and page_size=100, and then in the next turn, call again with page=2, but since the user is asking for all now, maybe the assistant should make a single call with page_size=100. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. Therefore, the assistant should call get_api_tokens with the parameters that would retrieve as many tokens as possible, but the user might need to handle multiple pages. But the user's question is to get all, so the assistant should make the call with the maximum page_size. So, the function call would be api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with user_id=12345, and page=1, page_size=100. But the user's user ID is 12345, so the function's args would be user_id=12345, and the other parameters are default. However, the get_api_tokens function's parameters include include_expired, which is default False. So, the function call would be:\n\n<functions><function name=\"api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens\"><params><param name=\"user_id\" value=\"12345\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"page\" value=\"1\" type=\"integer\"/><param name=\"page_size\" value=\"100\" type=\"integer\"/></params></function></functions>\n\nBut the user's user ID is 12345, so that's the parameter. The other parameters are default, so they can be omitted. However, the function's parameters include user_id, include_expired, page, and page_size. Since the user didn't specify include_expired, it's default False. So, the function call would include user_id=12345, page=1, page_size=100. That should retrieve all tokens in one go. But the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So, the answer is to call get_api_tokens with those parameters."}

The user is asking for a reminder, so set_alarm seems appropriate. The parameters for set_alarm include alarm_time and purpose. The alarm_time needs to be in a specific format. The user provided the date as 2023-12-1 and time as 7:00 AM. The function's example shows 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' for the date and time. So I should format the alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' because the user mentioned 'tomorrow' which is 2023-12-1. The purpose is 'meeting' as the user said \"for a meeting\".\n\nWait, the user said \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". Oh, maybe that's a typo. But the date is 2023-12-1, so the correct date is 2023-12-01. So the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. The purpose is 'meeting'. \n\nThe function set_alarm's purpose is optional with a default of 'reminder', but the user specified 'meeting', so I should include that. \n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose='meeting'. \n\nI need to make sure the date is correctly formatted.
