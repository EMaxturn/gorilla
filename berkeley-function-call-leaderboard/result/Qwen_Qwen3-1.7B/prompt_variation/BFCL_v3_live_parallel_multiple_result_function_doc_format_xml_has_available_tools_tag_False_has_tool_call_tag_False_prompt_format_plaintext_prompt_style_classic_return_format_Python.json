The user mentioned both Python and Java, so I need to call the function twice, once for each skill. Wait, but the function can take a single skill at a time.

The experience_level and availability are optional, but the user didn't specify any, so I can leave them out. That should get the list for each language.

The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let's break down each step.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function is the right tool here. The parameters needed are repo_url and optionally destination. Since the user didn't specify a destination, we can leave it as the current directory. So the first function call would be clone_repo with repo_url set to the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. For this, the create_a_docker_file function is needed. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, the directory_name would be the cloned repo's path. But since the user didn't specify, maybe we need to use the directory name from the clone. However, the function requires the directory name as a parameter. So we need to call create_a_docker_file with the directory name as the cloned repo's path. But wait, the clone_repo function's destination is optional. If the user didn't specify, the default is the current directory. So the directory_name here would be the cloned repo's path, which is the same as the directory where the clone was done. But since the clone is done, maybe the directory is already there. However, the function requires the directory name as a parameter. So the user needs to specify that. But the user hasn't provided the exact directory name, so perhaps we can assume that the cloned repo is in the current directory. So the directory_name would be the cloned repo's path, which is the same as the directory where the clone was done. But since the clone is done, maybe the directory is already there. However, the function requires the directory name as a parameter. So the user must provide it. But the user hasn't specified, so maybe the directory is the current working directory. So the function call would be create_a_docker_file with directory_name set to the cloned repo's path. But since the clone is done, perhaps the directory is already there. However, the function requires the directory name as a parameter. So the user needs to provide it. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe we can proceed with the assumption that the directory is the current directory. So the function call would be create_a_docker_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\" (assuming the repo name is nodejs-welcome). But the exact path might vary. However, the user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis.\" So the directory_name is the directory where the repo is located. Since the clone is done, the directory is the cloned repo's path. But the user hasn't provided the exact path, so maybe we can proceed with the directory name as the cloned repo's name. But perhaps the user expects that the directory is the same as the repo name. So maybe the directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function is needed. The parameters are directory_name, and optional ones like deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The directory_name here would be the same as the cloned repo's directory. Again, assuming the directory is \"nodejs-welcome\", the function call would be create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function is used here. The parameters are directory_name, commit_message (optional), branch_name (optional), force_push (optional). The user hasn't specified commit message, branch, or force push, so we can use the default. The function will automatically git add all changes. So the call would be push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name set to the cloned repo's path. Again, assuming the directory is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nNow, putting it all together. The first function call is clone_repo with repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\". Then create_a_docker_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", then create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", then push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function. The function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So the parameters are set to default values. So the function call would be push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\")\n2. create_a_docker_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n4. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n\nBut need to check if the directory_name is correctly set. The cloned repo's directory is the same as the repo name. So the directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]"}

They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the 'get_relevant_classes' function seems appropriate. The parameters required are a search string, case sensitivity, and include_subdirectories. The search string here would be 'CellResult', and they want to include subdirectories, so set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. However, the parameters for get_signature are class_name, method_name, and include_private. The user is asking for the signatures of these two methods, so I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The class_name would be 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method_name would be 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. Since the user didn't specify if they want private methods, I'll leave include_private as false unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides the methods. So the 'AbstractCellHandler' is the parent class. The get_signature function needs to be called for each method. So I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The parameters for each call would be class_name='AbstractCellHandler', method_name as specified, and include_private=False.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult', case_sensitive=False, include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature for 'setCellValue' with class_name='AbstractCellHandler', include_private=False.\n3. get_signature for 'getCellValue' with class_name='AbstractCellHandler', include_private=False.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly set. The user didn't mention case sensitivity, so default is false. The include_subdirectories is set to true as per the request. The functions are correctly applied here. The user might need to check if the methods exist in the parent class, but the functions are designed to retrieve the signatures and relevant classes. So the answer should include these function calls."}

The get_current_weather function needs a location parameter. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\". I should check if the format is correct. The example given in the function's params is \"San Francisco, CA\" or \"Paris, France\". Queenstown is in Singapore, so maybe the format should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\".

The function doesn't require the event_type to be a specific category, so either \"concerts\" or \"theater plays\" should work. Let me check if the function allows multiple event types.

The user might want both, but the function might return either. Alternatively, maybe the user wants both, so perhaps two separate calls. But the user's question is to \"find any music concerts or theater plays\", so maybe a single call with event_type as \"concerts\" or \"theater plays\" and city as \"Los Angeles\", date as \"2023-03-10\".\n\nWait, the function's event_type is a single string, so I can choose one.

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user mentioned Sunnyvale, CA, so the city parameter would be \"Sunnyvale, CA\". The is_unisex is not specified, so maybe leave it as default or set to False? But the function allows it to be optional. However, the user didn't mention unisex, so maybe we can omit it or set it to False. But the function's required parameters are city and is_unisex is optional. So maybe we can call FindProvider with city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\" and is_unisex=False.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, there's Services_1_BookAppointment. The required parameters are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user specified 'Elegant Styles' as the salon, so stylist_name would be \"Elegant Styles\". The appointment_time is 15:00, which is 15:00 in 24-hour format. The date is 2023-05-10. So the parameters would be stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\".\n\nWait, but the function's parameters for BookAppointment require the stylist_name, which is the name of the salon, and the other parameters are time and date. So the user's request is to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon, so the stylist_name is \"Elegant Styles\". The time is 15:00, date is 2023-05-10. So that's correct.\n\nSo the two function calls would be FindProvider with city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\" and is_unisex=False (assuming the user didn't specify unisex), and BookAppointment with the given parameters. But the user didn't mention unisex, so maybe the is_unisex parameter can be omitted since it's optional. However, the function's required parameters are stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The is_unisex is optional. So the FindProvider call would have city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\" and is_unisex=False (or maybe not included if it's optional). But the function's required parameters are only the city, and is_unisex is optional. So the call would be Services_1_FindProvider(city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\", is_unisex=False) or just city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\" if is_unisex is not provided. But the function's parameters say is_unisex is required? Wait, no, the required parameters for FindProvider are city, and is_unisex is required? Let me check the function definition again.\n\nLooking back: the parameters for Services_1_FindProvider are city (required) and is_unisex (required? No, the required is false. The required attributes are: <param name=\"city\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\"> and <param name=\"is_unisex\" type=\"boolean\" required=\"false\">. So is_unisex is not required.

Services_1_BookAppointment(stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\")\n\nBut the user might want to know if the salon is unisex. Since the user didn't specify, maybe we can leave is_unisex as default, but since it's optional, we can omit it. So the first function call is Services_1_FindProvider with city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\".\n\nSo the answer should have both function calls."}
