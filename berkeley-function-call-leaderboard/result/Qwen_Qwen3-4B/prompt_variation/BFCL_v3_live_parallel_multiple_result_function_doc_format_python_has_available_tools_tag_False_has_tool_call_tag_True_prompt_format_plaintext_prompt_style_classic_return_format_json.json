The new preferences are large hot coffee, regular sweetness, and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function takes drink_id and new_preferences as a dict.

The get_news_report function can retrieve news based on location, category, and language. The parameters required are location, category, and language. The location needs to be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, France, since it's a city in a country, I can use 'Paris, France'. For Letterkenny, Ireland, it should be 'Letterkenny, Ireland' as well. The category for the second query is 'Technology', and the language is 'en' for both.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"again in English\" for the second query. So the first one is general news, and the second is technology. Wait, no, the user says \"focusing on technology news again in English\". Wait, the original question says \"also for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news again in English\". So maybe the first one is general, and the second is technology. But the initial request says \"latest news report for Paris, France, in English and also for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news again in English\". So the first location (Paris) is general, and the second (Letterkenny) is technology.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. The default destination is current directory, so I'll use that. No mention of recursive or depth, so defaults apply. So first function call is clone_repo with the provided URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, maybe the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'? Wait, the clone command's destination is default to current dir, but the repo's name is nodejs-welcome. So the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome'. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires directory_name. The analysis might have determined the language, but the user says to create based on analysis. However, the function doesn't take parameters from the analysis, just the directory. So maybe the directory is the same as the repo's directory. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nNext, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user didn't specify these, so use defaults. Deployment name defaults to directory_name, image_name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, add all changed files to git. The push_git_changes_to_github function is for pushing, but adding changes is part of git add. However, the provided functions don't have a git add function. Wait, the push function says it will git add all changes. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". Maybe the push function does that? Or maybe the user wants to run git add before pushing. But the available functions don't have a git add command. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe the push function is used here. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. However, the push function's args include directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. So perhaps after creating the files, we need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name, commit message, branch, etc. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is git add, but the function provided doesn't have that. So maybe the push function is used here, but the user might need to run git add first. However, since the functions are limited, maybe the push function is the only one that handles adding changes. But the description says it will automatically git add. So perhaps the user's step 3 is covered by the push function. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. However, the push function's parameters include commit_message and branch. So maybe the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name, commit message, branch, etc. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, which might be part of the push function's process. So the steps would be: after creating the files, call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, branch, etc.\n\nSo the functions to call are:\n\n1. clone_repo with the given URL.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome' and defaults for other parameters.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is git add, but the push function's description says it will automatically git add. So maybe the push function is the one to call here. So the steps are:\n\nAfter creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files, call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, etc. So the functions are:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, then commit and push. However, the push function's description says it will push all changes, including adding them. So the push function is the one that handles both adding and pushing. Therefore, the correct sequence is to call the push function after creating the files.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with the URL.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with the directory.\n3. create_a_docker_file with the directory.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the directory and defaults.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, branch, etc.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, which is part of the push function's process. So the answer should include all these function calls."}

The function get_relevant_classes seems appropriate here. The search_string should be 'CellResult', and since they want to include subdirectories, I'll set include_subdirectories to True. The case_sensitive parameter is optional and defaults to False, so I can leave that as is.\n\nNext, the user needs the signatures of the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function can retrieve the method signatures. For 'setCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method name is 'setCellValue'. Similarly, for 'getCellValue', the class is the same, and the method name is 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional and defaults to False, so unless the user specified private methods, we can leave it as default.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. But the error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class is part of the same repository, and the user needs to check its methods. However, the user's main request is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get the method signatures from 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo, the first function call should be get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories True.

They want two things: the area of a square with a side of 5 cm and the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. \n\nFirst, for the area of the square. The function available is get_area_of_square, which takes a 'size' parameter. The user provided 5 cm, so I'll use that. The unit isn't specified, but the function's default is Fahrenheit, but wait, that's for temperature. Oh, no, the get_area_of_square function's parameter is 'size' as a float. So the unit here is just the unit of measurement, but the function doesn't require a unit parameter. The user says 5 cm, so I'll input 5.0 as the size. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user wrote Queenstown Singapore. That might be a mistake. But the function get_current_weather requires a location. The user might have intended Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore by mistake. However, the function can take a location like 'City, Country'. So I'll use 'Queenstown, Singapore' as the location. But maybe that's not a real place. However, the function will handle it as per the input. So I'll call get_current_weather with location 'Queenstown, Singapore' and default unit to Fahrenheit.\n\nWait, but the user might have made a typo.

So maybe the user wants both, so I should call the function once with event_type \"concert\" and once with \"theater play\" or similar. But the function's example uses \"concerts\" and \"plays\" as possible values. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a combined type. However, the parameters are singular.

So I need to make two separate calls. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can take \"concert\" and \"theater\" as different types.
