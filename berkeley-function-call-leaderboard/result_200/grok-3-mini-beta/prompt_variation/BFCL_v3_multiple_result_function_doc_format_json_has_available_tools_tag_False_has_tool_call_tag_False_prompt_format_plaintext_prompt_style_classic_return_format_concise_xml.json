The art_form parameter is described as \"The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" So, \"sculpture\" seems appropriate, and \"modern\" might be implied or not directly supported, but we have to work with what's available.\n\n- Month: The user said \"in the upcoming month\". The parameter is 'month', and its description says: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" If I don't provide it, it defaults to upcoming events, which matches.\n\n- User ratings: The user said \"top rated\", which likely means high ratings. The parameter is 'user_ratings' with options: low, average, high. Default is 'high', so if I don't specify, it will use 'high'.\n\nFor **find_exhibition**, required parameters are 'location' and 'art_form'.
