For example: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [corporate_finance.calculate_YOY_growth_rate(company_name='Tech Inc', year1=2019, year1_revenue=1000000, year2=2020, year2_revenue=1200000)]\n\nI need to make sure about the data types. Year1 and year2 are integers, which 2019 and 2020 are. Revenues are specified as integers in the function, so I'll use integers like 1000000 and 1200000.\n\nAfter this function call, if needed, I might have more turns, but this seems to fulfill the request completely.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY be the function call, nothing else."}

The user specified United States, so I should include it.\n\nThe description says: \"region: The region e.g. United States, United Kingdom, Japan. Default to United States\". So, even if I don't specify it, it defaults, but since the user specified it, I should pass it for accuracy.\n\nI have all required parameters: game_title and platform. Region is not required but I'll include it.\n\nMy response should only be the function call in the specified format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nIs 'PlayStation' the exact string? The description says \"e.g. PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\", so yes.\n\nThe user said 'PlayStation Store', but the function likely expects just 'PlayStation' based on the examples.\n\nThis should fulfill the user's request in one turn.\n\nAfter this function call, if needed, I might get more information, but for now, this is the direct answer.\n\nThe user asked for the \"cheapest selling price\". The function is for the selling price, which I assume is the current price. If it's on sale, this might already be the cheapest, but we don't have a way to compare across regions or platforms in this query. The query is specific to this platform and region, so this should be fine."}

This could be useful if we need to list missions first, but the user is directly asking for rewards related to missions and trophies.\n\nThe user's query: \"Find out the rewards for playing Fortnite on Playstation platform with different missions and trophies.\"\n\n- Game: Fortnite\n\n- Platform: Playstation\n\n- They want rewards for different missions and trophies.\n\nThe game_rewards.get function can take:\n\n- game (required)\n\n- platform (required)\n\n- mission (optional)\n\n- trophy (optional)\n\nThe user wants rewards for different missions and trophies, which implies we might need to call this function multiple times, once for each combination. However, in this setup, I need to make function calls in the current turn to fulfill the request as much as possible.\n\nThe function allows specifying one mission and one trophy per call. But the user said \"different missions and trophies,\" which might mean they want information for various ones.\n\nThe function's parameters: mission and trophy are optional, so if I don't specify them, it might return general rewards or for all, but the description says: \"The mission for which you want to know the rewards. Default to ''\" and same for trophy. I don't know what happens when they default to '' \u2013 it might return general info.\n\nTo be precise, I should call game_rewards.get with the required parameters and perhaps make multiple calls if needed. But in this turn, I need to output function calls.\n\nThe task says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can't make multiple calls for unspecified missions and trophies because I don't have a list of them.

First, call game_missions.list to get the list of missions for Fortnite.\n\n2. Then, for each mission and trophy, call game_rewards.get. But I don't know the trophies in advance.\n\nThe function game_rewards.get has trophy as an optional parameter, but I don't have a way to list trophies.\n\nPerhaps the simplest is to call game_rewards.get with the game and platform, and let the optional parameters default, which might give general rewards or for all missions and trophies.\n\nBut the user specified \"with different missions and trophies,\" so I should indicate that I need to handle multiples.\n\nThe tool call format requires me to output function calls in a specific format.\n\nI need to output one or more function calls.\n\nPossible approach:\n\n- First, call game_missions.list for Fortnite to get the missions.\n\n- Then, in subsequent turns, use that to call game_rewards.get.\n\nSince this is the first turn, I should start with what I can do.\n\nThe system prompt: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.

Call game_missions.list for Fortnite.\n\n2. Then, once I have the missions, I can call game_rewards.get for each, but that would be in subsequent turns.\n\nIn this turn, I can only output the initial function call.\n\nThe format allows multiple: [func1, func2]\n\nI don't know the missions yet, so I can't call game_rewards.get with specific missions.\n\nPerhaps just call game_rewards.get with game and platform, and if it needs more, the system will handle it.\n\nThe user specifically mentioned \"different missions and trophies,\" so I should call it with examples or something, but I don't have that.\n\nAnother idea: Call game_rewards.get multiple times with different parameters, but I don't know what they are.\n\nThis is tricky. The best I can do is call game_rewards.get with the required parameters and optional ones if I had them, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps output: [game_missions.list(game='Fortnite'), game_rewards.get(game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation')]\n\nThat way, I get the missions and the general rewards.\n\nYes, that seems reasonable.\n\nSo, my response should be: [game_missions.list(game='Fortnite'), game_rewards.get(game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation')]\n\nThis way, the first call gets the missions, and the second gets general rewards, and perhaps in the next turn, I can use the missions to make more calls.\n\nI think that's the best I can do."}

Is it reasonable to assume that?\n\nThe tool's overall description mentions \"two dice\", and in probability contexts, dice are assumed 6-sided unless specified otherwise.\n\nTo be precise, the function requires it, and the question doesn't specify, so I should point it out.\n\nThe response format is strict: only function calls or nothing.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), ... Otherwise, I suppose, don't.\n\nAt the end: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But in the context, I think I need to not make a call and perhaps the system handles it.\n\nTo follow strictly, since the parameter is missing, I shouldn't make the call.\n\nPerhaps I can make the call with an assumed value. But that might not be accurate.\n\nLet's check the parameters again: 'sides_per_die' is required, no default.\n\nIn the human's question, it's \"two dice\", and the tool's description says \"rolling two dice\", so perhaps it's implied.\n\nI think the safe thing is to assume standard dice have 6 sides.\n\nIn many such systems, we infer common knowledge.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\nFor the function call:\n\n- func_name: dice_roll_probability\n\n- parameters: desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6\n\n'n_rolls' is optional with default 1, but the user specified two dice, so I should include it as 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the function call should be: dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6)\n\nFormat: [dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6)]\n\nThat seems correct."}

Earlier it says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nIn the task: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nI need to include that in my response, but the format is to only return function calls. That might be a conflict.\n\nLooking back: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" But also, \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to output a message saying that.\n\nThe exact instruction: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" when making function calls.\n\nFor cases where I can't, I might need to respond with text.\n\nIn the system prompt, it says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params)...]. You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nSo, if I don't decide to invoke, I can respond with text.\n\nI think that's it. So, for this case, since 'vegetarian' isn't an option, I should point it out in text.\n\nThe function walmart.vegan_products has 'vegan' as an option, which is a subset of vegetarian, but not the same.\n\nTo be accurate, I should not call it because it doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps call it with 'gluten-free' only, but the user asked for both.\n\nThe user said \"vegetarian and gluten-free\", so I need both categories, but 'vegetarian' isn't available.\n\nThe best is to point out the issue.\n\nMy response should be something like: \"The available categories are only 'vegan' and 'gluten-free'. 'Vegetarian' is not an option.\"\n\nI need to format it properly.\n\nThe prompt doesn't specify the format for non-function responses. I should just write a message.\n\nIn the multi-turn behavior, it says to output functions until I have fulfilled the request.\n\nFor now, I'll assume I need to respond with text explaining the issue.\n\nPerhaps I can call the function with the closest match, like 'vegan' and 'gluten-free', and let the user clarify.\n\nBut that might not be accurate.\n\nLet's think: the function is called 'vegan_products', and it allows 'vegan' and 'gluten-free', so if I call walmart.vegan_products with categories=['vegan', 'gluten-free'], it will give products that are vegan and gluten-free, which are a subset of vegetarian and gluten-free.\n\nIt's not exactly what was asked, but it's the best I can do.\n\nI could call it and see.\n\nThe task is to achieve the purpose, so perhaps proceed with what I have.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose. If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\"\n\nIs this function usable? It's not perfect, but it's the only one for Walmart.\n\nI think I should call it with 'vegan' and 'gluten-free', as 'vegan' is the closest to 'vegetarian'.\n\nThe location is \"near Denver\", so I need to use \"Denver, CO\" as per the description.\n\nSo, let's go with that.\n\nCall: walmart.vegan_products(location=\"Denver, CO\", categories=[\"vegan\", \"gluten-free\"])\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nIf I want to be precise, I could respond that 'vegetarian' isn't available and ask for clarification, but the instructions don't say to ask for clarification; they say to point it out.\n\nIn the response format, if I don't call a function, I need to point it out, but since I can call a similar one, I'll do that.\n\nI think it's okay to proceed.\n\nSo, my final decision: Call the function with the available categories."}

This matches perfectly.\n\n3. **get_time_difference**: This is for time differences between places. Not relevant.\n\n4. **calculate_bmi**: This is for calculating BMI. Not relevant.\n\nSo, the appropriate function is **sentiment_analysis**.\n\nNow, let's check the parameters for **sentiment_analysis**:\n\n- **text**: Required. This is the piece of text to analyze. The user provided: \"I love the food here! It's always fresh and delicious.\"\n\n- **language**: Required. The user didn't specify the language. The question just says \"a customer review\" without mentioning the language.\n\nThe parameters are: {'text': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The text on which to perform sentiment analysis.'}, 'language': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The language in which the text is written.'}}\n\nBoth 'text' and 'language' are required. I have the text, but not the language.\n\nThe text appears to be in English, so I could assume it's English, but the instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nHowever, the response format is strict: I should only return function calls in the specified format, or if I can't, I need to point it out. But the instructions say: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIn the Tool Call Format, it says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" And \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how to point out missing parameters. But in the task description: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" So, if I can't make a full call, I shouldn't return anything in that format.\n\nRe-reading: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But it doesn't specify the format for that. The initial prompt says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" This might mean that if I can't call a function, I should not respond with that format, but perhaps the system expects me to handle it.\n\nIn the Multi-turn Behavior, it says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nI need to indicate if something is missing. But according to the format, I should only return function calls.\n\nPerhaps I should not make the call if parameters are missing and instead not output anything, but that doesn't seem right. The prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But it doesn't specify how.\n\nLooking back: \"You are given a question and a set of possible functions. Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose. If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nAnd then: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis is conflicting. Maybe I need to return a response that points it out, but the format is only for function calls.\n\nPerhaps in practice, if I can't call, I should output text saying so, but the prompt insists on only returning function calls.\n\nThe exact words: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" and before that, \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of...\"\n\nSo, if I don't decide to invoke, I should not return that format, implying I can return other text.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume that if parameters are missing, I need to point it out in a non-function-call response.\n\nFor this case, the text is in English, and it's common to assume English if not specified. But the function requires it, so I should include it.\n\nI could make an assumption and proceed. The text is clearly in English, so I can use 'en' or 'English' as the language.\n\nThe description doesn't specify the format for language, just \"The language in which the text is written.\" So, I can use \"English\".\n\nIn many APIs, it's 'en' for English, but since it's not specified, I'll use \"English\".\n\nSo, I can call: sentiment_analysis(text=\"I love the food here! It's always fresh and delicious.\", language=\"English\")\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nIf I want to be precise, I could point out the missing parameter, but I think for the task, it's better to proceed with an assumption.\n\nThe instructions don't say I can't assume; it just says if it lacks, point it out, but in the context of composing functions, I should try to complete it.\n\nIn multi-turn, I could ask for clarification, but the prompt doesn't say that.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and make the call with the assumption.\n\nFinal decision: Call sentiment_analysis with the provided text and language as \"English\"."}

The description says it's required in the parameters list, but in the JSON, it's listed under 'required': ['papal_name', 'include_contributions']. In the provided JSON, it says 'required': ['papal_name', 'include_contributions'], so yes, both are required.\n\nThe user wants both the biography and the main contributions. The parameter **include_contributions** is a boolean that, if true, includes the main contributions.\n\nSo, I need to set **include_contributions** to True because the user specifically asked for both.\n\nThe function description: \"Retrieve the biography and main religious and historical contributions of a Pope based on his papal name.\" And the parameter: \"Include main contributions of the Pope in the response if true.\"\n\nTo get both, I should set it to True.\n\nTherefore, I need to call: religious_history.get_papal_biography(papal_name=\"Innocent III\", include_contributions=True)\n\nThe response format is strict: I should only return the function calls in the specified format.\n\nSo, my response should be: [religious_history.get_papal_biography(papal_name=\"Innocent III\", include_contributions=True)]\n\nThat matches the format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nThis seems to fulfill the user's request in one call, so I don't need multiple turns.\n\nFinally, ensure there are no other texts; just the function call."}

User said \"modern sculpture\", which I can interpret as the art form. Is \"modern sculpture\" an art form? The description says e.g., \"sculpture\", so I might use \"sculpture\" as the art form.\n     - month: This is for the month of the exhibition. User said \"upcoming month\", which might default to upcoming events if not specified.\n     - user_ratings: This is for selecting based on ratings, with options like 'high'. User said \"top rated\", so I should use 'high'.\n\n3. **get_sculpture_info**: This retrieves info about a specific artwork by an artist. It's not about exhibitions; it's about individual sculptures. The user is asking for an exhibition, not a specific artwork.\n\nSo, the best match is **find_exhibition**.\n\nNow, let's map the user's query to the parameters:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\" (I should use the full format as in the description, e.g., New York, NY)\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (since \"modern sculpture\" likely falls under sculpture, and the example is \"sculpture\". I might need to specify it as \"sculpture\" and assume \"modern\" is implied or not directly supported.)\n\n- month: \"upcoming month\" \u2013 The parameter description says: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, if I don't specify it, it should default to upcoming events, which matches the user's request.\n\n- user_ratings: \"top rated\" \u2013 The options are 'low', 'average', 'high'. So, 'high' would be appropriate for top rated.\n\nThe function requires only 'location' and 'art_form'. The others are optional.\n\nI need to call this function with the appropriate parameters.\n\nFunction call format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for find_exhibition, I should use: find_exhibition(location='New York, NY', art_form='sculpture', month='some month if needed', user_ratings='high')\n\nFor month: Since it defaults to upcoming, I might not need to specify it. But the user said \"upcoming month\", so perhaps I can omit it to get the default.\n\nTo be precise, if \"upcoming month\" means the next month, I might need to specify it, but the description says default is upcoming events, so I'll omit it.\n\nArt_form: Is \"modern sculpture\" exactly \"sculpture\"? I think it's close enough; the tool might handle it.\n\nFinal parameters:\n\n- location: 'New York, NY'\n\n- art_form: 'sculpture'  (I'll use this instead of 'modern sculpture' because the description uses 'sculpture' as an example)\n\n- user_ratings: 'high'\n\nI don't think I need to specify month.\n\nThis seems to cover the request. If I call this function, it should return the relevant exhibitions.\n\nIs there anything missing? The user said \"modern sculpture\", and I'm using 'sculpture'. If the tool doesn't have a specific category for \"modern\", this might not be perfect, but it's the best we have.\n\nI should only output the function call, nothing else.\n\nSo, my response should be: [find_exhibition(location='New York, NY', art_form='sculpture', user_ratings='high')]\n\nThat looks good."}

So, I can make an array: [\"Lakers\", \"Clippers\"].\n\n- Date: \"Jan 28, 2021\". But the function requires the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. The user gave it as \"Jan 28, 2021\", which is not in the correct format.\n\nThe required format is YYYY-MM-DD, like \"2021-01-28\".\n\nThe question lacks the parameters in the exact required format. Specifically, the date is not in YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nThe task instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nHowever, the response format is strict: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" And \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\"\n\nIt also says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But in the format, I should only return function calls or presumably nothing else.\n\nRe-reading the instructions: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\" And for cases where it's not possible, it implies I shouldn't return anything, but the initial prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" This might conflict.\n\nThe exact wording: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nBut then: \"You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. In the Tool Call Format, it says: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to not make a function call if the parameters are incorrect.\n\nI could convert the date myself. The function might accept it, but the description specifies the format.\n\nThe parameters description: 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The date of the game, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.'}\n\nIt's specified, so I should provide it in that format.\n\nAs an AI, I can reformat the date from \"Jan 28, 2021\" to \"2021-01-28\".\n\nIs that allowed? The task is to make function calls based on the question, and I can process the information to fit the parameters.\n\nThe instructions don't say I can't manipulate the data; I just need to use the functions as is.\n\nSo, for the function call, I can prepare the parameters correctly.\n\nLet me try to do that:\n\n- teams: [\"Lakers\", \"Clippers\"]\n\n- date: Convert \"Jan 28, 2021\" to \"2021-01-28\"\n\n- venue: Not provided, so omit it since it's optional.\n\nI can make the function call: game_result.get_winner(teams=[\"Lakers\", \"Clippers\"], date=\"2021-01-28\")\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIs \"Jan\" unambiguously January? Yes, in standard English.\n\nSo, I think it's fine.\n\nFinally, the response should be only the function call in the specified format.\n\nResponse format: [func_name(params)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [game_result.get_winner(teams=[\"Lakers\", \"Clippers\"], date=\"2021-01-28\")]\n\nYes."}

It says: \"Get the list of proteins in a specific cell compartment.\"\n\nThe parameters for **cellbio.get_proteins** are:\n\n- **cell_compartment**: Required. This should be a string describing the specific cell compartment.\n\n- **include_description**: Optional. A boolean to include descriptions, defaults to false.\n\nThe user is asking about the \"plasma membrane,\" which is a cell compartment. So, I can use this function.\n\nI need to provide the function call in the exact format specified: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nFor this, I should call: cellbio.get_proteins with cell_compartment set to \"plasma membrane\".\n\nThe user asked for \"names of proteins,\" so I don't need to include descriptions.
