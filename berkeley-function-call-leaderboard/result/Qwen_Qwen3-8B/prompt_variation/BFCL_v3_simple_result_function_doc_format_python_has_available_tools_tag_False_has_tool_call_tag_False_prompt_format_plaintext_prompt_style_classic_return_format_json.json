The user wants to calculate the final velocity of an object falling from a 150-meter building with an initial velocity of zero. I remember there's a function called calculate_final_velocity that does this. Let me check the parameters. The function requires height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height here is 150 meters. The initial velocity is given as zero, so I should set that. Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless the user wants a different value. Since the question doesn't mention any other gravity, I can use the default. So the parameters would be height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Wait, the function's parameters have defaults for initial_velocity and gravity. So even if they're not provided, the function will use the defaults. But the user specified initial velocity is zero, so I should include that. Let me make sure. The function's Args say initial_velocity has a default of zero, but the user is explicitly stating it's zero. Including it anyway is safe. So the function call should have height=150, initial_velocity=0, and maybe gravity=9.81. But since gravity's default is already 9.81, maybe it's optional. But to be precise, including all parameters is better. Wait, the user didn't mention gravity, so maybe it's better to use the default. So the parameters would be height=150 and initial_velocity=0. That should cover it. Let me double-check the formula. The formula for final velocity when dropped from rest is sqrt(2gh). So with g=9.81 and h=150, the calculation should be correct. So the function call should be calculate_final_velocity with those parameters."}

The example says city name, so maybe just the city. But sometimes locations might need the state.
