We must use the provided functions to achieve the steps.\n\n Step 1: Clone the repository.\n   - We are given the repo URL: git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n   - We don't have a destination specified, so we can omit the `destination` parameter.\n   - We are not told to clone recursively or with a depth, so we can omit `recursive` and `depth`.\n\n Step 2: Analyse the contents of the repo and then create/update a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n   - After cloning, we know the repository will be in a directory. The repository name is \"nodejs-welcome\", so the directory will likely be \"nodejs-welcome\".\n   - We can use `analyse_repo_contents` to determine the predominant language. However, note that the function `create_a_docker_file` does not require the language as input, so we might not need the analysis result for Dockerfile creation? But the problem says \"based on the analysis\". \n   - However, looking at the function `create_a_docker_file`, it only requires the directory name. It doesn't take the language. Similarly, `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also only requires the directory name and other optional parameters.\n\n But note: The description of `create_a_docker_file` says it \"generates a Dockerfile ... to enable containerization of the application.\" It might be that the function internally analyses the directory? Or maybe the function is designed to work without explicit language? Since we don't have a function that returns the language, and the `analyse_repo_contents` function only returns the language (but we don't have a function that uses that language explicitly), we might skip using the analysis function if the Docker and Kubernetes creation functions are designed to work without it.\n\n However, the problem says: \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". So we must call `analyse_repo_contents` as part of step 2. But note: the analysis function returns the language, but we don't have a function that uses that language. Therefore, we must assume that the analysis is for the benefit of the user or for the next steps? But the next steps (creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs) do not require the language as a parameter.\n\n Since the problem says to do the steps, we will do:\n\n   Step 2.1: Create/update Dockerfile -> call `create_a_docker_file` with the directory name.\n   Step 2.2: Create Kubernetes YAMLs -> call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with the directory name.\n\n But note: the problem says \"based on the analysis\". So we must do the analysis first? However, the functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs do not take the language as a parameter. Therefore, it is possible that the `create_a_docker_file` function internally does the analysis? Or maybe the analysis step is separate and we are just required to log it? But the problem says to use the functions provided.\n\n Since we are required to do the analysis, we will call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory. But then we don't use the result? That seems odd.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the `create_a_docker_file` function is expected to use the analysis? But the function signature doesn't require the language. So we must assume that the `create_a_docker_file` function will do its own analysis? Then why do we have a separate analysis function?\n\n Given the ambiguity, we follow the steps as written:\n\n   Step 2: analyse the contents -> call `analyse_repo_contents` on the directory.\n   Then, step 2.1 and 2.2: create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n But note: the problem says \"based on the analysis\". So we must pass the result of the analysis to the creation functions? But the creation functions don't take the language. Therefore, we must assume that the analysis step is for the benefit of the creation functions and that the creation functions will use the same directory and hence the same context? Or maybe the analysis function sets some state? That is not indicated.\n\n Since the functions are independent, we do:\n\n   Step 2.1: `create_a_docker_file` with the directory name.\n   Step 2.2: `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with the directory name.\n\n And we do the analysis step for the sake of following the instruction, even though we don't use the result in the next functions.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes. But note, the function `push_git_changes_to_github` automatically adds all changes. So we don't need a separate step for adding.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push. We use `push_git_changes_to_github` which does add, commit, and push.\n\n However, note that the push function requires:\n   - directory_name: the local repository directory.\n   - commit_message: optional, but we should provide one? The problem doesn't specify, so we can use a default? But the function doesn't have a default. We must provide a commit message? The function says it is required: false. So we can omit? But then what commit message would be used? It's better to provide one.\n\n Since the problem doesn't specify the commit message, we can use a generic one.\n\n Also, note: the problem says \"add all changed file to git changes\" and then \"commit / push\". The push function does all of that.\n\n So:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo\n   Step 2: \n        a) analyse_repo_contents (on the directory we cloned to, which is the repo name without the .git: \"nodejs-welcome\")\n        b) create_a_docker_file (on the same directory)\n        c) create_kubernetes_yaml_file (on the same directory)\n   Step 3 and 4: push_git_changes_to_github (on the same directory, with a commit message)\n\n But note: the problem says \"using the steps provided in their respective sections\". We are following the steps.\n\n However, we must note that the clone step will create a directory. What is the directory name? \n   - The clone function: if we don't specify a destination, it will create a directory named after the repo. The repo is \"nodejs-welcome\", so the directory will be \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n Therefore, we will use \"nodejs-welcome\" as the directory_name for the subsequent steps.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo with repo_url = \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n\n   Step 2a: analyse_repo_contents with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n   Step 2b: create_a_docker_file with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n   Step 2c: create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n   Step 4: push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\", and we must provide a commit_message? The problem doesn't specify, so we can use a default message. Let's use \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\".\n\n   Also, note: the push function has other optional parameters. We don't have a branch name and we are not forcing, so we can omit.\n\n But note: the problem says \"add all changed file to git changes\" (step 3) and then step 4 is commit/push. Since the push function does step 3 and 4 together, we don't need a separate step.\n\n However, the problem lists step 3 separately. But the push function does step 3 and 4. So we can do step 3 and 4 with one function call.\n\n But note: the problem says step 3 is \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is part of the push function.\n\n Therefore, we will do:\n\n   [\n      {\"function\": \"clone_repo\", \"parameters\": {\"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"}},\n      {\"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n      {\"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n      {\"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"}},\n      {\"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\", \"parameters\": {\"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\", \"commit_message\": \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\"}}\n   ]\n\n But note: the `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` function has optional parameters. We are only providing the required one. The rest will be defaulted.\n\n However, we must consider: the problem says to do step 2.2: \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis\". We are not passing any analysis result. But the function doesn't take it. So we assume it does its own analysis? Or uses the same directory? That's acceptable.\n\n Also, note: the problem says \"create/update dockerfile\". The function `create_a_docker_file` will create or update? The description says \"generates\" which might mean it overwrites? But we don't know. We follow.\n\n But note: the problem says \"add all changed file\". The push function does that.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the push function does \"git add all changes\". So it will include the Dockerfile and the Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\n Let's output the function calls accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do all the following using the steps provided in their respective sections.\" and we are doing each step.\n\n However, we are making multiple function calls. We must return them in the required JSON format.\n\n Important: We must output the function calls in the exact order of the steps.\n\n Let's write the function calls in the order:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo\n   Step 2: \n        - analyse_repo_contents\n        - create_a_docker_file\n        - create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n   Step 3 and 4: push_git_changes_to_github\n\n But note: the problem has step 3 as \"add all changed file to git changes\" and step 4 as \"commit / push\". We are combining them in one function.\n\n Since the push function does both, we are covering.\n\n Therefore, we return:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"clone_repo\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"analyse_repo_contents\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"create_a_docker_file\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"push_git_changes_to_github\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\",\n      \"commit_message\": \"Added Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment files\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBut note: the problem says step 2.1 is \"create/update dockerfile\" and step 2.2 is \"kubernetes yamls\". We are doing both after the analysis. The order of 2.1 and 2.2 doesn't matter? We do Dockerfile first then Kubernetes.\n\n Also, note: the push function has an optional `branch_name`. We are not providing, so it will use the current branch. That is acceptable.\n\n We assume the clone step creates the directory \"nodejs-welcome\", and all subsequent steps use that same directory.\n\n However, what if the clone step does not create the directory with the expected name? The function `clone_repo` without destination will use the default, which is the repository name. So it should be \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n We are good.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do all the following\". We are doing the steps in one go.\n\n However, the system will execute these functions in order.\n\n Therefore, we return the above JSON array."}

We can use the function `get_signature` for each method. Note that we are only interested in public methods, so we don't need to set `include_private` (or set it to false).\n\nHowever, note that the `get_signature` function requires the class name and method name.

We can omit it.\n\nHowever, note that the user's error is about a method 'getNumericValue()' not found in 'CellResult'.

But the function doesn't return a unit. We are just passing the number.\n\n Important: The function `get_current_weather` requires the location to be in a specific format. We are using \"Queenstown, Singapore\". But note that Queenstown is a neighborhood in Singapore. It might be better to use a more standard city name? However, the function description says it can take a location in the format of 'City, Country'. Since Queenstown is in Singapore, we can use that.\n\n Alternatively, we could use \"Singapore, Singapore\" to get the weather for Singapore? But the user specifically asked for Queenstown, Singapore. We'll use \"Queenstown, Singapore\".\n\n However, if the weather service does not have data for Queenstown, it might fail. But the function is designed to take any location in that format, so we pass it as given.\n\n We are not including the unit for weather because it's optional and the user didn't specify.\n\n Let's write the function calls accordingly."}

The user wants to find music concerts or theater plays in Los Angeles on March 10th, 2023.\n The function we can use for this is Events_3_FindEvents. It requires:\n   - event_type: which can be either \"concert\" or \"theater\" or we might need to do two separate searches? \n   However, note the description: \"The category of the cultural event.\" \n   The function doesn't specify if it can take multiple types. Since the user asks for either, we can do two separate calls? \n   But looking at the parameters, we can only specify one event_type per call.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a more general term? The function doesn't specify what event types are allowed. \n Given the examples in the function description, it mentions \"concerts and plays\". So we can try:\n\n   Option 1: Make two calls: one for \"concert\" and one for \"theater\"\n   Option 2: Since the function doesn't specify, we might try a broader term? But it's better to stick to the examples.\n\n Let's do two calls: one for \"concert\" and one for \"theater\".\n\n Also note: the city parameter requires format: 'City, State (abbr)' or just 'City'. Since Los Angeles is in California, we can use \"Los Angeles, CA\".\n The date is March 10th, 2023 -> formatted as \"2023-03-10\".\n\n So we will call Events_3_FindEvents twice:\n\n First call:\n   event_type: \"concert\"\n   city: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n   date: \"2023-03-10\"\n\n Second call:\n   event_type: \"theater\"\n   city: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n   date: \"2023-03-10\"\n\n However, note that the function has an optional date. We are providing it.\n\n But note: the function Events_3_FindEvents has the parameter 'date' as required=false, meaning we can omit it? \n But the user specifically wants March 10th, so we include it.\n\n Since the function does not allow multiple event types in one call, we make two separate calls.\n\n Let's generate the function calls in the required JSON format."}

Since the user didn't specify, we can omit it or set to `dontcare`? \n    However, the function description says: \"dontcare for no preference\". But note the parameter type is boolean? Actually, the description says it can be true, false, or dontcare. \n    But the type is boolean? That might be an error. Looking at the function definition: \n        <param name=\"is_unisex\" type=\"boolean\" required=\"false\">\n        ... or dontcare for no preference.\n    But boolean doesn't have three states. This might be a mistake in the function definition. \n    However, since the function is defined with `required=\"false\"`, we can simply omit it if the user doesn't specify.\n\n 2. Book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\n But note: the booking function requires the stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date.\n\n However, the user has provided:\n   stylist_name: 'Elegant Styles' (which is the salon name)\n   appointment_time: 15:00 (which is in 24-hour format)\n   appointment_date: 2023-05-10 (in the correct format)\n\n But wait, the first part is to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA. The user might be asking for two separate things? \n Actually, the request is: \n   \"search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA\" \n   and \n   \"book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon for me at 15:00 on 2023-05-10\"\n\n However, note that the booking is for a specific salon. The search might be for a different purpose? \n But the user didn't ask to book with the found stylist, but with a specific salon. \n\n So, we have two independent actions?\n\n But note: the user might be implying that they want to book at 'Elegant Styles' in Sunnyvale? \n However, the salon name 'Elegant Styles' might be in Sunnyvale? The user didn't specify the city for the booking. \n\n However, the booking function does not require a city. It only requires the stylist_name (which can be the salon name), time and date.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n Step 1: Search for hair stylists in Sunnyvale, CA (without any unisex filter, so we omit the `is_unisex` parameter).\n Step 2: Book an appointment at 'Elegant Styles' at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\n But note: the booking function does not check if the salon is in Sunnyvale? It might be that the salon is in a different city? \n However, the user's request does not specify the location for the booking. They only provided the salon name. \n We assume that the user knows the salon and we are just booking.\n\n Therefore, we can make two function calls:\n\n First call: Services_1_FindProvider with city = \"Sunnyvale, CA\" (note: the format should be 'City, State (abbr)'. So we write \"Sunnyvale, CA\").\n Second call: Services_1_BookAppointment with stylist_name = \"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time = \"15:00\", appointment_date = \"2023-05-10\".\n\n However, note: the user didn't specify the state for the booking. But the booking function doesn't require it. \n\n But wait, the search function is for Sunnyvale, and the booking is for a salon that might not be in Sunnyvale? \n The user didn't say that they want to book a salon in Sunnyvale. They just said book at 'Elegant Styles'. \n\n Since the booking function doesn't require location, we can book without knowing the location? \n But in reality, the salon name might be ambiguous? However, the user provided the exact name. \n\n We'll proceed with the two function calls.\n\n However, note: the system might require that we have the salon in our database? But that's beyond our control.\n\n So, we output two function calls in the required JSON format.\n\n Important: The function names must be exactly as provided.\n\n Let's write the first function call for the search:\n   function: \"Services_1_FindProvider\"\n   parameters: { \"city\": \"Sunnyvale, CA\" }\n\n Second function call for booking:\n   function: \"Services_1_BookAppointment\"\n   parameters: { \n        \"stylist_name\": \"Elegant Styles\",\n        \"appointment_time\": \"15:00\",\n        \"appointment_date\": \"2023-05-10\"\n   }\n\n But note: the user didn't specify if the salon is unisex? So we skip that in the search.\n\n However, the user's request for search does not specify unisex, so we omit the `is_unisex` parameter.\n\n Let's output the JSON array."}
