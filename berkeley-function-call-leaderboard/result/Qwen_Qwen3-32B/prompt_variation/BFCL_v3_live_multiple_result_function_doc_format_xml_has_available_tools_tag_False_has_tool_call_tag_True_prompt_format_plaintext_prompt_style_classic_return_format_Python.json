The user is asking for an Uber ride of type 'Plus' from the address '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nLooking at uber.ride, the parameters required are loc (string), type (string), and time (integer). The loc needs to be in the format 'Street Address, City, State'. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits that format. The type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. All required parameters are present.\n\nNow, checking uber.ride2, its description says it's for finding weather at a location, which doesn't seem relevant here. The parameters for ride2 include loc (City, State), type, and optional time. But since the function's purpose is weather, it's not the right choice for booking a ride.\n\nSo the correct function to use is uber.ride with the provided parameters.

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include searching in recall memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user's question is about a person's birthday, it's possible that information might be in the core memory's 'human' section or in the archival memory. \n\nI should start by checking the core memory. The core_memory_search function isn't available, but the recall_memory_search can look through conversation history. Wait, the user hasn't provided any prior conversation history here, so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to know public information. But since I can't access external data, I need to use the functions provided.\n\nIf the birthday isn't in the core memory, I might need to search the archival memory. But the user hasn't provided any archival data yet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the http_request function to look up Shishir Patil's birthday online. Let me check the functions again.\n\nYes, there's an http_request function. I can make a GET request to a search engine or a public database. Let me try that. For example, using a search query like \"Shishir Patil birthday\" and parsing the result. However, the http_request function requires a URL and method. Let me structure the request.\n\nWait, the http_request function needs a method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, and optional payload. So I can use a GET request to a search engine's API. For example, Google's search URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=Shishir+Patil+birthday. But I need to handle the response. However, the function returns the response, so I can process it to extract the birthday.\n\nOnce I get the birthday, I can then use send_message to send a congratulation message. The user didn't specify the recipient's details, but maybe the message function allows sending without a recipient, but the parameters say 'recipient' is optional. Wait, the send_message function has a 'recipient' parameter as optional. If not provided, maybe it defaults to the current user's context. But the user wants to send it to Shishir Patil. However, without knowing his contact info, I can't fill in the 'recipient' parameter. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to \"send a congratulation message to him.\" But the send_message function requires a 'recipient' parameter. Since I don't have Shishir Patil's contact information (email or phone), I can't complete the send_message call. Unless the user expects me to infer that the message is sent through the current conversation channel, but the function parameters require a recipient. This is a problem.\n\nSo, the steps are: 1) Find Shishir Patil's birthday using http_request. 2) Send a message using send_message. But step 2 requires the recipient's details, which I don't have. The user might have expected that the message is sent via the current platform, but the function requires a specific recipient. Maybe the user made a mistake in not providing the recipient's info. Alternatively, perhaps the 'recipient' parameter is optional, and the message is sent to the user who asked, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nIn this case, I can proceed to find the birthday via http_request, but when sending the message, I might not have the recipient's details. The user might need to provide that. But since the user's question is to send the message, perhaps they expect me to handle it without the recipient, but the function requires it. So, maybe the answer is to first perform the http_request to find the birthday, then use send_message with the recipient as Shishir Patil's contact info, but since I don't have that, I can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the core_memory_append to store the birthday once found, but that's part of the process. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use http_request to search for Shishir Patil's birthday.\n2. Parse the response to extract the birthday.\n3. Use send_message to send a congratulation message, but need the recipient's details.\n\nSince the recipient's details are missing, the send_message function can't be completed. Therefore, the correct approach is to first find the birthday via http_request, then inform the user that the birthday is found, but the message can't be sent without the recipient's contact information. However, the user's instruction is to send the message, so perhaps they expect me to proceed with the http_request and then send the message assuming the recipient is known. But given the function parameters, it's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, make the http_request to find the birthday. Then, if successful, call send_message with the message and recipient. But since the recipient isn't provided, the send_message call would be incomplete. However, the user might have intended for the message to be sent to the user themselves, but that's unclear. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct function calls are to first perform the http_request to get the birthday, then send the message once the birthday is known. However, the send_message requires the recipient parameter, which is missing. So, the assistant should first retrieve the birthday and then inform the user that the message can't be sent without the recipient's details. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make the necessary function calls. So, the assistant will proceed with the http_request and then attempt to send the message, even if the recipient is missing, but the function call would be invalid. Alternatively, the assistant might need to inform the user, but since the assistant can only use the functions, perhaps the answer is to make the http_request and then send the message with the recipient as a placeholder. But the user might not have provided the necessary parameters. \n\nGiven the constraints, the assistant should proceed with the http_request to find the birthday and then use send_message with the message content, but the recipient parameter is missing. However, the send_message function allows the recipient to be optional, so maybe it's okay. Wait, the send_message function's 'recipient' parameter is optional. If not provided, maybe the message is sent to the current user's context. But the user wants to send it to Shishir Patil. Without the recipient's info, the message can't be sent. Therefore, the assistant can only retrieve the birthday and then inform the user that the message can't be sent without the recipient's details. But since the assistant can't send messages outside the provided functions, the correct approach is to make the http_request and then send a message to the user (the one who asked) that the birthday was found but the recipient info is missing. However, the user's instruction is to send the message to Shishir Patil. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The assistant should proceed with the http_request to find the birthday and then attempt to send the message, even if the recipient is missing, but the function call would be invalid. Alternatively, the assistant can only retrieve the birthday and then send a message to the user (the one who asked) that the birthday was found and that the recipient's info is needed. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make the necessary function calls. \n\nIn this case, the assistant will first make the http_request to find the birthday. Then, once the birthday is known, the assistant can send a message to the user (the one who asked) with the congratulation message, but that's not what the user requested. The user wants to send the message to Shishir Patil. \n\nGiven the constraints, the assistant will proceed with the http_request and then use send_message with the message content, but the recipient parameter is missing. However, the send_message function allows the recipient to be optional, so maybe the assistant can proceed. But in reality, without the recipient, the message can't be sent. \n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are:\n\n1. http_request to search for the birthday.\n2. send_message with the congratulation message, but the recipient is not provided. \n\nBut the user's instruction is to send the message to Shishir Patil, so the assistant should make the http_request and then send the message once the birthday is known. However, the recipient's details are missing. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant will proceed with the http_request to find the birthday and then send the message, even if the recipient is missing, but the function call would be incomplete. However, according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should make the necessary function calls. So, the assistant will proceed with the http_request and then send the message with the message content, but the recipient is not provided. The user might need to provide the recipient's details for the message to be sent successfully."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the October 2019 statement period. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The BankStatementOverView function seems necessary because it provides an overview of the bank statement with account info. The parameters required are bank name, account number, account type, full name, and transaction overview. The user provided the bank name (U.S. Bank), account number, account type (business checking), and full name (SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING). The transaction overview would need a summary, which might come from another function.\n\nLooking at the transaction_summary.generate function, it requires transactions, dates, totals, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just totals. The Alltransactions function could retrieve transactions for a period, but the user didn't mention needing individual transactions, just a summary. The TotalTransactions.calculate function could compute totals, but the user already provided deposit and withdrawal amounts.\n\nWait, the user has given total deposits and withdrawals, so maybe we can use that. The BankStatementOverView needs a transaction_overview, which is a dict. Maybe we can create a summary using the provided totals. However, the transaction_summary.generate function might be needed to generate the summary. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, perhaps we can't use that. Alternatively, maybe the TotalTransactions.calculate can be used to compute the totals, but the user already provided them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the BankStatementOverView's transaction_overview can be constructed from the given totals. The user provided total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with those values. Let me check the parameters for BankStatementOverView: the transaction_overview is a summary including totals and counts. The user hasn't provided the count of transactions, but maybe we can infer that from the TotalTransactions.calculate function. However, the user hasn't given the number of transactions, so maybe we can't. \n\nWait, the user is asking for a summary of transactions, which might include the list of transactions. But since they didn't provide individual transactions, perhaps we can't generate that. However, the Alltransactions function could retrieve them if we had the statement period. The user's statement period is October 2019, so the statement_period would be '2019-10'. But the user hasn't asked for pending transactions, so include_pending is optional. But the user might need to call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then pass them to transaction_summary.generate. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the assistant needs to call Alltransactions first. \n\nBut in the given scenario, the user is providing the data, so maybe the assistant can use the provided data to construct the necessary parameters. Let me think again. The user provided total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances. The BankStatementOverView requires a transaction_overview, which is a dict. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with keys like total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance. Then, the BankStatementOverView function can be called with those parameters. \n\nAdditionally, the user wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions array, dates, totals, and customer names. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions. However, the user might have provided enough data to generate a summary without individual transactions. Wait, the transaction_summary.generate function requires a list of transactions, which the user hasn't provided. So maybe that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the TotalTransactions.calculate function to compute the totals, but the user already provided them. So perhaps the assistant can proceed with the BankStatementOverView function using the given data and then use the transaction_summary.generate with the provided totals and customer info. \n\nWait, the user's full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, which is the account name. The transaction_summary.generate requires firstname, lastname, and optionally middlename and company_name. Since the account is under SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, maybe the company_name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nFirst, call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters (bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, transaction_overview). The transaction_overview would be a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance. \n\nThen, call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions (but the user hasn't provided individual ones), so maybe that's not possible. However, the user might have intended to use the totals provided. Wait, the transaction_summary.generate requires a transactions array, which the user hasn't given. So perhaps the assistant can't generate that part. But the user is asking for a summary of transactions, which might just be the totals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the Alltransactions function to get the transactions for October 2019, but the user hasn't provided the actual transactions. Since the user is providing the data, maybe the assistant can assume that the Alltransactions function would return the necessary data. However, without knowing the actual transactions, the assistant can't generate the summary. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user provided the totals but not individual transactions. The BankStatementOverView can be called with the given data. The transaction_summary.generate might not be possible without individual transactions. However, the user might expect the summary to include the totals they provided. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and then use the transaction_summary.generate with the provided totals and customer info, even without individual transactions. But the transaction_summary.generate requires a transactions array. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the assistant can't proceed. \n\nWait, the user is asking for a summary of transactions for the period, which might just be the totals. The transaction_summary.generate function requires the transactions array, but the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the assistant can't generate that part. However, the user might have intended to use the Alltransactions function to get the transactions. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't simulate that. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView with the provided data and then perhaps note that the transaction summary requires individual transactions which aren't provided. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should make function calls based on the given data. \n\nSo, the assistant will call BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and then call transaction_summary.generate with the provided totals and customer info, even though the transactions array is missing. But that's not possible. Therefore, the assistant can only call BankStatementOverView and maybe TotalTransactions.calculate, but the user already provided the totals. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant can call BankStatementOverView and then use the transaction_summary.generate with the given totals and customer info, but the transactions array is required. Since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant can't. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters, and the transaction_overview includes the totals provided. The transaction_summary.generate can't be called without the transactions array. \n\nSo the final answer is to call BankStatementOverView with the parameters provided by the user."}

{"id": "live_multiple_277-128-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to find restaurants in New York with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating. First, I need to check the available functions. The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. It requires category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned intermediate price, which I can map to a price range. The location is New York, but the function expects 'City, State' format. Since New York is a city and state is NY, I'll use 'New York, NY'. They also want outdoor seating, so set has_seating_outdoors to true. The category isn't specified, but it's a required parameter. Hmm, maybe the user didn't mention it. Wait, the function requires category, so I can't leave it out. But the user didn't specify a cuisine type. Maybe I should assume a general category or ask for clarification. However, the user hasn't provided that info. Since the function requires it, I need to make an assumption. Maybe use a generic term like 'any' or leave it blank? Wait, the function's parameters don't allow that. The category is required. Oh, maybe the user just wants any restaurant, but the function can't handle that. Wait, looking back at the function's description: \"Searches for restaurants based on specified location, category, and other optional preferences.\" So category is required. But the user didn't specify a category. This is a problem. How to proceed? Maybe the user expects to get a list of restaurants across all categories, but the function can't do that. So perhaps I need to make an assumption, like using a common category or leave it as a placeholder. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to mention a category but forgot. Since the function requires it, I have to include it. Maybe the user is okay with any category, but the function requires a specific one. This is a missing parameter. Wait, the user's query is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating in New York. They didn't specify the cuisine. So perhaps the category can be omitted? No, the function requires it. Therefore, the function call is missing the category parameter. But the user hasn't provided it. So in this case, the assistant can't proceed without that information. Wait, but the user might not know the category. However, according to the function's parameters, category is required. So the correct approach is to point out that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. However, the user is asking to make the function call if possible. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" So in this case, the category is required, but the user didn't provide it. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the category is missing. However, the user's example in the problem statement shows that when parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But in this case, the user wants to find restaurants with certain criteria, but the category is missing. So the correct response would be to indicate that the category is required but not provided. However, maybe the user intended to not specify a category. But the function can't handle that. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the category is missing. However, looking back at the problem statement, the user wants the assistant to make the function call if possible. But since category is required and not provided, the assistant can't make the call. Therefore, the correct answer is to point out the missing parameter. But the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section if possible. If not possible, point it out. So in this case, the assistant should not make the function call and instead indicate that the category is missing. However, the user's query might have implied that the category is not specified. Wait, the user's query is \"find some restaurants that have been tagged as intermediate priced for cost. Please include outdoor seating areas in New York.\" There's no mention of cuisine category. Therefore, the category parameter is missing. Hence, the function can't be called. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says to return the function calls if possible, else point it out. So the assistant should respond that the required parameter 'category' is missing. However, maybe the assistant can make an assumption. For example, maybe the category can be left as a wildcard. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the assistant must include it. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the category is missing. However, in the problem statement, the user might have intended to not specify the category. But the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. So the answer is to point out the missing category. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls if possible. Since the category is missing, the assistant can't make the call.

The function uses strings for all three parameters, and the user provided names as strings. No issues there. The function should return the list of movies matching those criteria. That should cover the user's request."}

The parameters needed are track, artist, device, and album. The user specified the track as \"Remind Me\" and the artist as Carrie Underwood.

So I can omit it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play the song, so the function call would be Music_3_PlayMedia with track=\"Remind Me\" and artist=\"Carrie Underwood\". The other parameters like device and album are optional, so they can be left out. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned \"Pop music is my jam.\" But since they already specified the track and artist, maybe that's just additional info but not needed for the function call. Unless there's a case where the track name isn't unique and the genre helps, but the function Music_3_PlayMedia doesn't take genre as a parameter. So probably, just use the track and artist. \n\nSo the correct function call is Music_3_PlayMedia(track=\"Remind Me\", artist=\"Carrie Underwood\"). Let me make sure all required parameters are met. The track is required, which is provided. Artist is optional, so it's okay to include it. Device is optional, so no problem omitting it. Album is also optional. So that should work."}

The function allows parameters for artist, album, genre, and year. So I should set artist to \"Meghan Trainor\", genre to \"pop\", and year to 2018.

Since the user is asking to search for a hotel, not reserve yet, the correct function is Hotels_4_SearchHotel.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Hotels_4_SearchHotel: location is required. The user specified Sydney, Australia, so location should be \"Sydney, AU\". Star rating is 4, so star_rating is \"4\". Smoking allowed is a boolean, and the user wants smoking allowed, so smoking_allowed is true. Number of rooms is mentioned as two available, but the parameter description says it's for the number of rooms to reserve. The user might mean they need two rooms available, but the function's number_of_rooms parameter is for reservation. However, the user might be indicating they want hotels that have at least two rooms available. But the function's parameters don't specify availability; maybe it's a filter. The parameter says \"number of hotel rooms to reserve\" but allows \"dontcare\". Since the user is searching, perhaps the number_of_rooms here is for how many they want to reserve, but the user is asking for hotels that have two rooms available. Hmm, maybe the function's number_of_rooms isn't the right parameter for availability. But given the function's parameters, the best fit is to set number_of_rooms to \"2\" to indicate they want to reserve two rooms, but the user's question is about availability. However, since the function's parameters don't include availability, maybe the user's mention of two rooms is about how many they want to reserve. The user's exact wording is \"has two rooms available\", which might mean the hotel should have at least two rooms available. But the function doesn't have a parameter for availability. So perhaps the number_of_rooms in the search function is for how many the user wants to reserve, not the hotel's availability. In that case, the user's requirement is to reserve two rooms, so number_of_rooms should be \"2\". Alternatively, if the user is just searching for hotels that have two rooms available, but the function can't filter that, then maybe we can't use that parameter. But according to the function's description, number_of_rooms is for reservation. So maybe the user's mention of two rooms is about how many they want to reserve.

The MakePayment function is for sending money, which fits the user's request.\n\nLooking at the parameters for MakePayment: payment_method, amount, receiver, and private_visibility. The user mentioned \"debit card\" as the payment method, so that's the value for payment_method. The amount is $154. The receiver is the landlord's email. The private_visibility should be true since they want it private. \n\nWait, the amount in the MakePayment function's description says it's in USD. The user specified $154, which is in USD, so that's correct. The RequestPayment function's amount is in the smallest unit like cents, but here we're using MakePayment, so $154 as a float (154.00) should be okay. \n\nSo the correct function call would be Payment_1_MakePayment with payment_method=\"debit card\", amount=154.00, receiver=\"landlord's email\", and private_visibility=True.

RequestPayment is more for asking someone to pay you, I think.\n\nLooking at the parameters for MakePayment: payment_method is required. The user mentioned \"my debit card,\" so the payment method should be \"debit card.\" The amount is $200, which as a float would be 200.0. The receiver is Amelia's email, amelia@example.com. Then, private_visibility is a boolean, and since they want it private, set that to true.\n\nWait, the amount description says \"specified in USD.\" The user wrote \"$200,\" which is USD, so that's correct.

The user wants to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. The PlayMedia function requires a track, artist, device, or album. But the user isn't specifying a particular track; they want either from the album or from 2019. So maybe first, I need to look up the songs that fit those criteria.\n\nThe LookupMusic function allows searching by album, artist, genre, or year. Since the user mentioned the album 'High Expectations' and songs from 2019, I can use LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year 2019. But wait, the parameters for LookupMusic are artist, album, genre, year. Each is optional but can be specified. So I can set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019. However, if I set both, does it mean it will look for songs that are either from that album or from 2019? Or does it require both? The user's request is \"or alternatively\", so they want songs from the album OR from 2019. But the LookupMusic function might require combining parameters. Maybe the user wants to search for songs that are either in the album or from the year. Since the function allows multiple parameters, but how they are combined isn't clear. Maybe the function treats each parameter as an OR. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to make two separate queries. But the function might not support OR logic. So perhaps the best approach is to first look up songs from the album 'High Expectations' and if there are none, then look up songs from 2019. But since the user is asking for either, maybe the LookupMusic function can handle both by setting album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, which would return songs that match either condition. However, the function's parameters are all optional, but if you provide both, it might require both to be true. Wait, the description says \"match the user's specified preferences such as artist, album, genre, and release year.\" So if you specify multiple parameters, it's an AND. So if I set album and year, it would look for songs that are in that album AND from that year. But the user wants either. So maybe the correct approach is to make two separate calls: one for the album and one for the year. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is okay with songs that are in the album, and if not available, then from 2019. But the user's request is to hear a track from the album OR any song from 2019. So maybe the LookupMusic function should be called with album='High Expectations' and year=2019, but that would require songs that are in that album and from 2019. However, if the album 'High Expectations' was released in 2019, then that's correct. If not, then maybe the user wants either. But without knowing the release year of the album, perhaps the best is to first check the album, and if no results, then check the year. But since the user is asking for either, maybe the assistant should first look up the album, and if there are songs, then play one. If not, then look up 2019 songs. However, the current step is to generate the function call. Since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant needs to first find the songs. So the correct function to call here is Music_3_LookupMusic with album set to 'High Expectations' and year set to 2019. Wait, but if the function combines parameters with AND, then it would return songs that are in the album and from 2019. But the user wants either. So maybe the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the user's request is in a single query. The assistant can only make one function call per turn. So perhaps the best approach is to first try to look up the album, and if that doesn't return anything, then proceed to look up by year. But in this case, the assistant needs to make the first function call. Since the user mentioned both options, maybe the assistant should use the LookupMusic function with album='High Expectations' and year=2019, but that would require both conditions. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the album parameter and set year to 'dontcare' for the first query, then if no results, proceed to the year. But the user's request is to hear a track from the album OR from 2019. So perhaps the assistant should first check the album. Therefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='dontcare' (but the user also mentioned 2019 as an alternative). Wait, the user's request is to hear a track from the album OR any song from 2019. So the assistant needs to find songs that are either from the album or from 2019. Since the LookupMusic function can't handle OR, the assistant might need to make two separate calls. However, the user is asking for a single action. Maybe the assistant should first try the album, and if that fails, then try the year. But in the current step, the assistant can only make one function call. Therefore, the assistant should first attempt to look up the album. So the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations'. If that returns no results, then the next step would be to call Music_3_LookupMusic with year=2019. But since the user is asking for either, the assistant should handle that in subsequent steps. However, the current step is to generate the first function call. Therefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations'."}

The user wants to book a house in Austin, TX for four men over 18 from May 12th to May 18th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check if they need to search for available houses or book directly. Since they mentioned booking, maybe they already found a house. But the user didn't specify a particular house, so probably they need to search first. The function Hotels_2_SearchHouse is for searching available houses based on criteria. The parameters include location, which is Austin, TX. They have four adults, so number_of_adults should be 4. They might not have specified other filters like laundry or rating, so those can be optional. After searching, they can select a house and then use Hotels_2_BookHouse to book it with the dates and adults. But since the user's message is to book, maybe they assume a house is already selected. Wait, but the user didn't mention a specific house. So maybe the correct step is to first search for available houses. However, the user's message is phrased as \"book a house\", which implies they want to make the reservation. But without knowing which house, the system might need to search first. However, the available functions don't have a way to select from search results. The user might need to provide more info, but given the functions, perhaps the assistant should first call Hotels_2_SearchHouse with the given parameters, then once the user selects a house, call the book function. But since the user is asking to book, maybe they expect the booking function to be called directly. Wait, the booking function requires the house to be selected, but the user hasn't provided a specific house. So maybe the correct approach is to first search for available houses. Let me check the functions again. The Hotels_2_SearchHouse function can take where_to, number_of_adults, etc. So the assistant should first call Hotels_2_SearchHouse with where_to=Austin, TX, number_of_adults=4. Then, once the user selects a house from the search results, the assistant can call Hotels_2_BookHouse with the check-in and check-out dates. But in the current turn, the user hasn't selected a house yet, so the assistant should first perform the search. Therefore, the first step is to call Hotels_2_SearchHouse with the given parameters. The user's message says \"book a house\", but without prior search, so maybe the assistant should first search. Then, in the next turn, after the search results are provided, the user can select a house, and then the booking can be done. So the correct function call here is Hotels_2_SearchHouse with where_to=Austin, TX, number_of_adults=4.

Their user ID is \"user123\". Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the get_api_tokens function from api_token_api.APITokenApi. It requires user_id and optionally include_expired. Since the user didn't specify expired tokens, maybe we should default to not including them. But maybe include_expired=True would show all tokens, expired or not, which might be helpful for the user. Wait, the user just wants to know their existing tokens. If they didn't mention expired ones, maybe just get the active ones. But the function's include_expired is optional, so if we don't set it, does it default to false? The description says \"Flag to determine if expired tokens should be included\". So if we don't include the parameter, it might default to false, returning only active tokens. But the user might need to see expired ones as well. Hmm, the user's message is a bit ambiguous. However, since they said \"forgot all the API tokens\", maybe they want all, including expired. So perhaps set include_expired=True to ensure all tokens are retrieved.\n\nAnother function is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which also requires user_id and include_expired. The description mentions shareable tokens for custom dashboards. The user didn't specify that they need shareable ones, so maybe this isn't necessary unless the user's tokens are specifically for dashboards. Since the user just mentioned \"API tokens\" generally, the first function (get_api_tokens) is more appropriate.\n\nThe third function is post_api_token, which creates a new token. But the user is asking to retrieve existing tokens, not create a new one. So that's probably not needed here unless they need to generate a new one, but the question is about reminding them, not creating.\n\nSo the correct function to call is get_api_tokens with user_id=\"user123\" and include_expired=True to ensure all tokens are listed. That way, the user can see all their existing and expired tokens. Alternatively, if include_expired is not set, maybe the default is false, but since the user might not know, including expired could be more helpful. Let me check the parameters again. The include_expired is a boolean, required=false, so it's optional. The default behavior isn't specified, but the description says \"determine if expired tokens should be included\". So if not provided, the API might default to false. But the user might need all tokens, so including expired could be better. Therefore, I'll set include_expired=True to make sure all tokens are retrieved."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', the error rate threshold is 5%, and notifications should go to two emails.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application alert configuration,\" the create_global_application_alert_config function is the right choice here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (required), alert_type (required), threshold (required), recipients (required), and enabled (optional). The user provided the name, threshold (5% which is 0.05 as a float), and recipients. But they didn't specify the alert_type. However, since it's an error rate, the alert_type should probably be something like 'error_rate' or similar. The function requires alert_type, so I need to infer that from the context. The user mentioned \"error rate threshold,\" so I'll set alert_type to 'error_rate'.\n\nThe threshold is 5%, which as a float is 0.05. The recipients are the two email addresses provided. The enabled parameter isn't mentioned, so maybe it's optional. If the user didn't specify, perhaps the default is false, but since they want the alert to work, maybe we should set enabled=True. Wait, but the function's enabled parameter is optional. The user didn't say to enable it immediately, just to set up the configuration. However, sometimes when creating a config, you might want it enabled by default. But since the function has an enable function separately, maybe it's better to leave enabled as false unless specified. Wait, the user didn't mention enabling it, just creating the config. So maybe we don't include enabled unless the user says so. The function's required parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. So we need to include those.\n\nPutting it all together: name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05, recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']. The enabled parameter is optional, so we can omit it. Therefore, the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which requires user_id. The user provided that. This function retrieves shareable API tokens. But the description says \"shareable\" tokens, so maybe not all tokens. Then there's api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, which doesn't require user_id but has parameters like include_expired, page, and page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and appropriate pagination. However, the user didn't specify if they need expired ones, but since they said \"all,\" including expired makes sense. But the function doesn't require include_expired, so default might exclude them. To get all, set include_expired=True. Also, page and page_size: if the user has many tokens, pagination might be needed, but the user didn't specify, so maybe just get the first page with a large page_size, like 100. However, the function allows up to 100 per page. So call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and page_size=100. But the user's user_id is 12345, but the get_api_tokens function doesn't take user_id as a parameter. Wait, the first function does require user_id. So maybe the user needs to use get_shareable_api_tokens for shareable tokens and get_api_tokens for regular tokens. But the user wants all API tokens. Are the shareable tokens a subset? The user might need both functions. Let me check the parameters again. The get_shareable_api_tokens requires user_id, which the user provided. So first, call get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345. Then, call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and page_size=100. But the get_api_tokens doesn't take user_id, so maybe it's for the current user. If the user is authenticated, maybe the get_api_tokens would retrieve their own tokens. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe they need to use the first function for shareable tokens and the second for regular. However, the user might not know the difference. Since the user is asking for all tokens, perhaps both functions should be called. But the user might not have permissions for both. Alternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens is the correct one, and the user_id is not needed there. Wait, the get_api_tokens function doesn't have a user_id parameter. So if the user is the one making the request, their own tokens would be retrieved without needing the user_id. But the user provided their user ID, which is required for the first function. So maybe the user wants to retrieve both shareable and regular tokens. Therefore, the correct approach is to call both functions. First, get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345, and then get_api_tokens with include_expired=True and page_size=100. That way, the user gets all possible tokens. However, the user might not need to include revoked or expired, but since they said \"all,\" including them makes sense. So the function calls would be:\n\nCustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens(user_id=\"12345\", include_revoked=True)\napi_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens(include_expired=True, page_size=100)\n\nBut the user might not need include_revoked for the first function, but to be safe, include it. Alternatively, the default might be False. The user said \"all,\" so include_revoked=True would include revoked ones. Similarly, include_expired=True for the other function. So those parameters should be set. Therefore, the two function calls are needed."}
