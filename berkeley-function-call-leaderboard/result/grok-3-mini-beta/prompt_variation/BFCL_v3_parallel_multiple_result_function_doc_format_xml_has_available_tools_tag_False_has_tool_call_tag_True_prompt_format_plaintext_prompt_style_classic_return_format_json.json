In the tool call for linear_regression_fit, I need to specify the parameters now.\n\nI can't specify x and y until I have the data.\n\nTherefore, I must first call data_loading.\n\nMy response should be just the call to data_loading.\n\nThen, after that, the system will respond with the data, and I can make another call.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>```json [array of calls] ```</TOOLCALL>.\"\n\nI can have an array, but I should only include what I can now.\n\nPerhaps the system expects me to call them sequentially in separate turns.\n\nI think the safe bet is to call data_loading first.\n\nSo, I'll output: <TOOLCALL>```json [{\"function\":\"data_loading\",\"parameters\":{\"file_path\":\"dataset.csv\"}}] ```</TOOLCALL>\n\nIn the next turn, when the user or system provides the data, I can then call linear_regression_fit.\n\nThe human's message is the input, and I'm to respond with tool calls.\n\nYes.\n\nOne more thing: the user said \"setting x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales']\", so after loading, x is data['sales'], etc.\n\nAlso, for linear_regression_fit, set return_residuals to true, as per the user's request: \"calculate and return the residuals\".\n\nSo, in the next call, I'll need to do that.\n\nFor now, just the first call."}
