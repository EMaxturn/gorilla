The user wants to modify two things: their food order and their drink order. \n\nFirst, for the food part: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be \"without anchovies\", but the function's specialInstructions parameter is a string, so maybe that's where it goes. Wait, but the function's parameters have newIngredients and removeIngredients as separate. So maybe the specialInstructions is for other notes. But the user specifically said \"without anchovies\", which is a removal. So perhaps removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". The function's parameters have removeIngredients as a string, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the drink order: update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function is ChaDri.change_drink. The parameters required are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences include size: \"large\", temperature: \"hot\", sweetness_level: \"regular\", milk_type: \"almond\". The special_instructions parameter is part of new_preferences as well, but the user didn't mention any, so it can be left as default. So the new_preferences dictionary should have size, temperature, sweetness_level, and milk_type.\n\nSo I need to call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\", and maybe specialInstructions if needed. Then call ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id=\"123\" and new_preferences including the specified parameters."}

Wait, maybe the user wants interviewers qualified in either Python or Java. But the function can only handle one skill at a time. So I need to make two separate calls. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires 'skill' as a string, and the user specified both Python and Java.

The parameters for each call would be skill set to 'Python' and 'Java' respectively, with the other parameters using defaults. So the answer should be two tool calls."}

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. So I'll need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url and destination. The user didn't specify a destination, so the default is the current directory. I'll set repo_url to the given URL and leave destination as '.'.\n\nNext, step 2 involves analyzing the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function is needed here. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the repo directory. Since we cloned it into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory_name. Once analyzed, we need to create a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. \n\nFor the Dockerfile, the create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Again, using the current directory. Then, the create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use defaults. Deployment name defaults to the directory name, image name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, and service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\nAfter creating these files, step 3 is to add all changed files to Git. But the functions provided don't include a 'add changes' function. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function does a git add, commit, and push. But the user says \"add all changed files to git changes\", which is equivalent to git add. However, the available function is push_git_changes_to_github, which automatically adds changes. But the user might need to first add the changes before committing. However, the function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe we can call push_git_changes_to_github here, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" and step 4 is commit/push. But the functions don't have a separate add command. So perhaps the user's step 3 is part of the push function. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to add the new files (Dockerfile and YAMLs) before committing. But the available functions don't have an add command. So maybe the push function handles adding, but the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is commit/push. However, the push function does both. So perhaps the user's steps 3 and 4 are combined into the push function. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is commit and push. But the available function is push_git_changes_to_github, which does add, commit, and push. So maybe the user's steps 3 and 4 are covered by calling push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name and a commit message. The user didn't specify a commit message, so the default is 'Update changes'. The branch is 'main' by default. So the final step is to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name as the cloned repo directory.\n\nSo the functions to call are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name '.'\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name '.'\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name '.', using defaults for other parameters\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name '.' and default parameters.\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is git add. But the push function does that. However, the user's step 4 is to commit and push. So maybe the push function is called after adding. But the push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So perhaps the user's steps 3 and 4 are handled by the push function. Therefore, the correct sequence is:\n\nAfter cloning, analyze, create Dockerfile and YAMLs, then call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is commit and push. However, the available function is push_git_changes_to_github, which does both. So the answer would be to call that function after the other steps."}

They're getting a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', etc. But the error is related to 'CellResult', so I need to figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. \n\nFor the first part, the function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate. The parameters needed are 'search_string', which here would be 'CellResult', and they want to include subdirectories, so 'include_subdirectories' should be True. The default for that is False, so I need to set it explicitly.\n\nThen, for the method signatures, the 'get_signature' function can be used. They need the signature of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. So I'll need to call 'get_signature' twice, once for each method. The parameters are 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as each of the method names. Also, the 'include_private' parameter is optional and defaults to False, which is fine here unless the methods are private, but the user mentioned overriding them, so they're likely public.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class is part of the repository, and the user needs to check if it's correctly imported or if there's a missing class. But the user already asked for relevant classes, so the first function call is to get those classes. Then, checking the signatures of the methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure they're overriding correctly. \n\nSo the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True. Then call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. That should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The function available is get_area_of_square, which requires the size parameter. The user provided 5 cm, so I'll use that. The unit is cm, but the function's parameter is just a float, so 5.0 should be fine. No need for unit conversion here since the function just needs the numerical value.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is actually in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. Maybe they made a typo? But the function is get_current_weather, which needs a location. The user specified \"Queenstown Singapore\", which might be a mistake. But I should use the location as given. The parameters require 'location' in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. So \"Queenstown, Singapore\" would be the location. The unit isn't specified, so the default is fahrenheit. But since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the default. \n\nSo I need to call two functions: get_area_of_square with size 5, and get_current_weather with location \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The user might have intended Queenstown, New Zealand, but since they wrote Singapore, I'll stick with that. If there's an error, maybe the weather function will handle it, but according to the functions provided, that's the correct approach."}

Wait, the enum for event_type is ['Music', 'Theater'], so maybe I need to make two separate calls. But the function might allow specifying the event_type as one of them.
