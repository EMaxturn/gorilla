The description says it finds a ride based on location, type, and wait time. The second function, uber.ride2, mentions weather, which doesn't seem relevant here. \n\nThe user's request is straightforward: request a ride with specific location, type, and time. The required parameters for uber.ride are all provided: loc is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type is 'Plus', and time is 10 minutes. The uber.ride2 function includes a time parameter but it's not required, and the main purpose here is about the ride, not weather.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir's birthday. The user mentioned using recall memory, so I should check the conversation history. But wait, the functions available include 'recall_memory_search' which allows searching past interactions. However, the user hasn't provided any prior messages, so maybe the birthday isn't in the recall memory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the birthday is stored in the core memory under the 'human' section. The core memory has a 'human' sub-block for user details. If the user provided Shishir's birthday earlier, it might be there. But since there's no prior context, I can't assume that. \n\nWait, the user is asking to send a message, so maybe the birthday is known. But without access to the core memory's 'human' data, I can't retrieve it. The functions available don't include a way to read core memory directly, only append or replace. So if the birthday isn't in the core memory, I can't get it. \n\nHmm, the user might expect me to know Shishir's birthday from some external data, but the functions provided don't include a way to look up public information. The available functions are limited to memory operations and sending messages. \n\nSince the user wants a congratulatory message, maybe the birthday is known, and the task is to send the message. But without the date, I can't compose the message. Wait, perhaps the user expects me to use the 'message_chatgpt' function to ask for the birthday? But that's not efficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the birthday is in the archival memory. Using 'archival_memory_search' could find it if it was previously stored. But again, without prior data, this might not work. \n\nWait, the user might have provided the birthday in a previous message, but since there's no history given, I can't check. The functions available don't allow me to search core memory, only append or replace. \n\nSo, the problem is that I can't retrieve the birthday information. The user's request requires knowing the birthday, which isn't available through the provided functions. Therefore, I can't proceed to send the message without that data. \n\nBut the user might have intended for me to use the 'message_chatgpt' function to ask for the birthday. However, the functions don't include a way to retrieve public information. So, I need to inform the user that the birthday isn't available in the current memory and can't be retrieved. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to generate a generic message, but that's not helpful. Since the functions don't allow me to get the birthday, I should point out that the required information is missing. \n\nWait, the user might have provided the birthday in the initial setup, but since there's no context, I can't access it. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the birthday isn't available in the memory and can't be retrieved with the current functions."}

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, account name, start and end balances, total deposits, total withdrawals, and want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can help here. The BankStatementOverView function seems perfect because it's designed to provide an overview of a bank statement with account info and transaction summary. Let me look at its parameters. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview which is a dictionary.\n\nThe user mentioned \"business checking account,\" so account_type should be \"checking.\" The full_name is given as SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The bank name is U.S. Bank. The account number is 1-523-1713-5704. \n\nNow, the transaction_overview needs to include the totals and counts. The user provided starting_balance, ending_balance, total_deposits, total_withdrawals. Also, they mentioned other deposits and withdrawals, which probably refer to total_deposits and total_withdrawals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dict. So I need to structure that. Maybe include total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, and maybe the number of transactions. But the user didn't specify the count, so maybe just the totals. \n\nAlso, the function requires the transaction_overview as a dictionary. So I should format that. Let me check the parameters again. The transaction_overview is a dict, so I need to include keys like 'total_deposits', 'total_withdrawals', 'starting_balance', 'ending_balance', and perhaps 'number_of_transactions' if available. But the user didn't mention the count, so maybe just the totals. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned \"a summary of transactions for this period,\" which might require individual transactions. But the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a summary, not individual transactions. However, the user might need the totals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function could be used, but that requires a list of transactions. Since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, but only totals, perhaps BankStatementOverView is the right choice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n  \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n  \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40,\n  \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n  \"ending_balance\": 6737.37\n}\n\nWait, but the transaction_overview is a dict. The user might also need the number of transactions, but since it's not provided, maybe omit that. \n\nSo the function call would be BankStatementOverView with those parameters. That should cover the user's request for an overview including the account details and the summary of transactions with the provided totals."}

Since the user didn't mention cinema hall, language, or format, those are optional. So I should call get_movies with city set to Noida and movie_date as today's date, which is 4th November 2024. Wait, the system note says to default the movie date to current date if not provided. But the user did say \"today,\" so maybe the date is already covered. Let me confirm the parameters again. The function requires city (true), cinema_hall (false), movie_date (false), etc. Since the user didn't specify cinema hall, language, or format, I don't need to include those. So the function call should be get_movies with city: \"Noida\" and movie_date: \"04-Nov-2024\" (formatted as DD-MM-YYYY).

But the user said \"today,\" so maybe the system can handle that. Alternatively, if the function can accept 'today' as a value, but looking at the parameters, the movie_date is a string and the example formats include 'DD-MM-YYYY'.

Wait, the description for movie_date in get_movies says it's formatted as 'DD-MM-YYYY', but in get_show_times, the movie_date can be 'today', 'tomorrow', etc. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, looking back: for get_movies, the movie_date parameter's description says \"formatted as 'DD-MM-YYYY'\". But in get_show_times, the movie_date can be 'today', 'tomorrow', etc. So for get_movies, if the user says \"today,\" I need to convert that to the correct date format.

Its description says it exports VEX info as CycloneDX. The parameters needed are uuid and download. The uuid is required, which the user provided.

The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems appropriate here. It requires category, location, and optional parameters like price_range and has_seating_outdoors.\n\nThe user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" so I should map that to the price_range parameter. The function's price_range is a string, so maybe \"intermediate\" is acceptable, but sometimes systems use terms like \"medium\" or specific ranges. However, since the user used \"intermediate,\" I'll use that as the value.\n\nNext, the location is New York, so the location parameter should be \"New York, NY\" as per the required format.

Hmm, the function's category is a required field. But the user didn't mention any specific type of food. Maybe the category can be left out? Wait, no, the function's category is required. But the user's query doesn't specify a category. That's a problem. However, maybe the user is okay with any category as long as price and seating are met. But the function requires category. So perhaps the user's query is missing that parameter. But the user might not have specified it, so maybe I should proceed with the given info and note that category is missing. Wait, but the function requires category. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, looking back at the function definition for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants: the category is required. The user's query doesn't mention a category. So this is an issue. But the user might be okay with any category. However, the function can't be called without category. So maybe the user's request is incomplete. But the user might have intended to leave it open. Alternatively, perhaps the category can be a wildcard or omitted. But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, the user's query lacks a required parameter. But the user might not have provided it. So in this case, the function can't be called without category. However, maybe the user intended to leave it out, but the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant should point out that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. However, the user's question is to make the function calls. But since the function requires category, and the user didn't provide it, the function can't be called. But maybe the user intended to have any category. Alternatively, maybe the category can be left as an empty string? But the function requires it. So this is a problem. However, the user might have made a mistake. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, we should point it out. But the user's instruction says to make the function calls if possible. So perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available parameters and note the missing category. But the user's instruction says to only return the function calls if possible. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the assistant is supposed to return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. However, if parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But in this case, the user's question is missing the category parameter. So the assistant should mention that. But the user's instruction says to only return the function calls. Wait, the initial instruction says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But the assistant is supposed to return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. However, if parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. But the user's instruction says to only return the function calls. So perhaps the assistant should proceed to call the function with the available parameters, even if some are missing. But the function requires category. So the assistant can't call the function without it. Therefore, the correct approach is to point out that the category is missing. But the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the TOOLCALL section. So the answer should be in the format of the function calls."}

They say \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe there's a typo, like \"2staying\" should be \"and staying\"? So the check-in is July 15th, staying 5 days.

The user wants a roundtrip flight from San Francisco to Atlanta, departing on March 1st, 2023, and returning on March 6th, with American Airlines in Economy class.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights function seems appropriate here. Let me look at its parameters. The origin_airport and destination_airport are required, which the user provided as San Francisco and Atlanta. The departure_date is March 1st, 2023, which should be formatted as '2023-03-01'. The return_date is March 6th, 2023, so '2023-03-06'. The user specified American Airlines, so the airlines parameter should be 'American Airlines'. The seating_class is Economy. \n\nWait, the function's parameters mention that departure_date is required but in the parameters, it's listed as required=\"false\". Wait, no, looking back: for Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights, departure_date is required=\"false\"? Wait, no, checking the XML again. The departure_date in the roundtrip function has required=\"false\", but the user provided a departure date. However, the return_date is also required=\"false\" but the user provided that as well. Wait, but the function's parameters for departure_date and return_date are both required=\"false\"? Wait, no, looking at the XML for Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights:\n\n<param name=\"departure_date\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n  <desc>The departure date for the trip in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.</desc>\n</param>\n<param name=\"return_date\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n  <desc>The return date for the trip in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If not specified, it is assumed to be 7 days after the departure date.</desc>\n</param>\n\nSo both are optional. However, the user provided both dates, so I should include them. The function allows specifying both dates. So the parameters would be origin_airport: San Francisco, destination_airport: Atlanta, departure_date: '2023-03-01', return_date: '2023-03-06', airlines: 'American Airlines', seating_class: 'Economy'. \n\nWait, the user said \"coming back on the 6th of March\", which is March 6th. So the return date is March 6th. So the parameters are correct. Also, the number_of_tickets isn't specified, so maybe default to 1? But the function's parameters for number_of_tickets is required=\"false\", so it's optional. Since the user didn't mention the number of tickets, maybe we can omit it or set it to 1. But the function doesn't require it, so perhaps it's better to leave it out unless specified. However, the user might need to specify it, but since they didn't, maybe the function can handle it. \n\nSo the function call should include origin_airport, destination_airport, departure_date, return_date, airlines, and seating_class. Let me structure the JSON accordingly. Make sure the dates are in the correct format. The user wrote \"2023 1st of March\" which should be '2023-03-01'. Similarly, the return date is '2023-03-06'. \n\nSo the function call would be Flights_4_SearchRoundtripFlights with those parameters. I don't see any missing required parameters here. The required parameters for the roundtrip function are origin_airport and destination_airport, which are provided. The other parameters are optional but the user specified airlines and seating class.

The album parameter should be set to 'The New Classic'. But wait, the function's parameters include artist, album, genre, and year. Since the user is referring to an album, maybe the album parameter is the way to go. However, the function's description says it finds songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. But the user is asking for songs similar to the album, which might not be directly supported. Wait, maybe the function can take the album name as a parameter. Let me check the parameters again. The Music_3_LookupMusic function has an album parameter where you can specify the album name. So if I set album to 'The New Classic', it might find songs from that album. But the user wants songs similar to that album, not necessarily from it. Hmm, maybe the function isn't designed for that. Wait, the function's description says \"Finds songs that align with the user's musical preferences based on the artist, album, genre, and release year.\" So if the user is looking for songs similar to the album, perhaps the function can use the album parameter to find songs from that album. But maybe the function isn't designed to find similar albums. Wait, the user might be referring to the album's artist. For example, if 'The New Classic' is by a certain artist, maybe the function can use the artist parameter. But the user hasn't specified the artist. So maybe the function can take the album name as a parameter to find songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, not necessarily from the same album. Hmm, perhaps the function isn't the right one here. Wait, maybe the Music_3_LookupMusic function can take the album parameter as 'The New Classic' to find songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, which might require a different approach. However, given the available functions, maybe that's the best option. Alternatively, maybe the function can use the artist parameter if we can infer the artist from the album. But the user hasn't provided the artist. So perhaps the function can't do that. Wait, the user might be referring to the album's artist. For example, if 'The New Classic' is by a certain artist, but without knowing the artist, we can't use that. So maybe the function can't find similar songs, but can find songs from the same album. But the user wants similar songs, not necessarily from the same album. So maybe the function isn't suitable. However, given the available functions, perhaps the best approach is to use the album parameter as 'The New Classic' to find songs from that album. But the user might be looking for similar tracks, which might not be possible with the given functions. Alternatively, maybe the function can take the album name and find similar ones. But the function's parameters don't mention similarity. So perhaps the function isn't designed for that. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the parameters again. The Music_3_LookupMusic function allows specifying artist, album, genre, and year. If the user wants songs similar to the album, maybe the function can use the album parameter to find songs from that album. But the user might want songs that are similar in style or genre. However, without knowing the genre, that's not possible. So perhaps the best we can do is use the album parameter as 'The New Classic' to find songs from that album. But the user might be looking for similar tracks, which might not be possible with the given functions. Alternatively, maybe the function can take the album name and find similar albums, but the parameters don't support that. So perhaps the function isn't suitable. But given the available options, maybe the user wants to look up the album and then find similar tracks. Wait, the user also mentioned tracks released around six years ago, which is 2017. So for that part, the year parameter is 2017. So the function calls should be in the format of JSON. Let me try to make sure I'm not missing any parameters. \n\nWait, the user might be asking for the function calls, but I need to make sure I'm not missing any parameters. Let me re-express the user's request. The user wants two things: 1) songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic', and 2) tracks released around six years ago (2023 - 6 = 2017). \n\nFor the first part, using Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' might find songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, which might not be possible. However, given the available functions, that's the only option. For the second part, using Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017' would find tracks from that year. \n\nSo the function calls would be two separate calls to Music_3_LookupMusic. The first with album='The New Classic', and the second with year='2017'. \n\nWait, but the user might want to combine both criteria. However, the functions don't allow combining multiple parameters. So two separate calls are needed. \n\nSo the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic'. The second is Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017'. \n\nBut the user might also want to explore tracks from the same artist as the album. However, since the artist isn't provided, we can't use that.

The function Events_3_FindEvents requires event_type, city, and date. The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. The event_type is required, but the user hasn't specified a particular type. However, the function requires it. Since the user mentioned concerts or plays, perhaps the event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play,\" but since they are asking for both, maybe the function can accept a comma-separated list. Therefore, I'll set event_type to \"concert,play.\" Alternatively, maybe the function expects a single type. If that's the case, perhaps the user needs to make two separate calls. But given the function's parameters, I'll proceed with event_type as \"concert,play\" to cover both. The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. So the function call would be Events_3_FindEvents with event_type \"concert,play,\" city \"Las Vegas,\" and date \"2023-03-06.\" Wait, but the city parameter in the function is described as \"the name of the city where the event is happening, formatted as 'City, State' or 'City' if the city does not have a state.\" Since Las Vegas is a city in Nevada, the state is NV.

The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. \n\nThe user isn't specifying a particular track, so maybe they want to find songs first. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can search by album or year. Let me check the parameters. The album parameter can be set to 'High Expectations' to find tracks from that album. Alternatively, setting the year to 2019 would get songs from that year. But the user said \"or alternatively,\" so maybe they want either option. However, the function allows specifying one parameter at a time. \n\nWait, the user might need to make two separate lookups: one for the album and one for the year. But the function allows for multiple parameters? Let me check. The Music_3_LookupMusic parameters are artist, album, genre, year. Each is optional. So if I set album to 'High Expectations', that would get songs from that album. If I set year to 2019, that would get songs from 2019. But the user wants either, so maybe two separate calls. However, the user might not want to do that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both? No, because the parameters are separate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a track from the album, so using Music_3_PlayMedia with the album parameter. But the PlayMedia function requires the track name, which the user hasn't specified. So perhaps first use LookupMusic to find the songs, then PlayMedia. But the user hasn't specified a track or artist, so LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' or year 2019. \n\nWait, the user says \"hear a track from the album\" or \"any song from 2019\". So maybe first, use Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' to get a list of tracks. Then, if that's not available, use the year 2019. But the user might not want to do that. Alternatively, the user might just want to play a track from the album, but without knowing the track name, maybe the LookupMusic is needed first. \n\nBut the user's request is to \"hear a track\", which implies playing. However, without knowing the track, perhaps the system needs to first find the tracks. But the functions available are PlayMedia and LookupMusic. Since the user hasn't specified a track, maybe the correct approach is to use LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' or year 2019. But the user might want to play a track, so maybe after finding the tracks, use PlayMedia. However, the user's message doesn't specify which track, so perhaps the assistant should first look up the songs and then play one. But the user's instruction is to make function calls. \n\nWait, the user's question is to \"hear a track\", so maybe the assistant should first find the tracks using LookupMusic, then play one. But the user hasn't specified which track, so the assistant might need to call LookupMusic to get the list, then PlayMedia with the track. However, the user's current request is to make the function calls. Since the user hasn't specified a track, perhaps the assistant should call LookupMusic with the album or year. \n\nBut the user's message says \"I would like to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations', or alternatively, any song that came out in 2019.\" So the user is asking to play a track from either the album or from 2019. But without knowing the track name, the assistant can't directly call PlayMedia. Therefore, the correct approach is to first use Music_3_LookupMusic to find the tracks that match either the album or the year. \n\nBut the function allows for multiple parameters. Wait, the Music_3_LookupMusic function can take album and year as separate parameters. However, the user is asking for either/or. So maybe the assistant should make two separate calls: one to get songs from the album and another to get the album. Wait, no. Let me think again. The user wants to find the best fit for the given question. The functions are provided, and the user wants to know which functions to call. \n\nWait, the user's question is about music, so the relevant functions are Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. The user wants to hear a track from the album 'High Expectations' or any song from 2019. Since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant needs to first find the tracks. So the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' to get tracks from that album. If that's not possible, then call Music_3_LookupMusic with year 2019. But the user might want both options. However, the assistant can only make one function call per turn. Wait, the user's instruction says to make one or more function calls. So the assistant can make two calls: one for the album and one for the year. \n\nBut the user might not want to do that. Alternatively, the assistant can call Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' first. If that returns results, then play one. If not, then check the year. But the user's current request is to make the function calls. So the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'High Expectations' and another call with year 2019. \n\nWait, but the user said \"or alternatively\", so maybe the assistant should first check the album, and if no results, then check the year. But the assistant can't know that in one step.

Also, the include_metadata parameter is optional, but maybe including it would provide more detailed info, though the user didn't specify. But since they just want the list, maybe it's okay to leave include_metadata as false or omit it. Wait, the parameter is required as false, so it's optional.

The service_name is given as 'fdsa'. The configurations need to be a dictionary. The user provided timeout, retry count, endpoint URL, and authentication. \n\nWait, the authentication part is a bit vague. The user says it requires authentication, but how to represent that in the config? Maybe as a boolean or a specific key. Since the example parameters include timeout, retry_count, endpoint_url, and maybe a key like 'authentication' set to True. But the user didn't specify the exact key. However, the function's configurations parameter is a dict, so I should map the given parameters into keys. Let's assume the keys are 'timeout', 'retry_count', 'endpoint_url', and 'authentication' (as a boolean). \n\nSo the configurations would be:\n{\n  \"timeout\": 30,\n  \"retry_count\": 5,\n  \"endpoint_url\": \"https://api.fdsa-service.com\",\n  \"authentication\": True\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the keys are correctly named.

Let me check the available functions to see which ones can help.\n\nFirst, there's the get_api_tokens function from the api_token_api. It retrieves a list of API tokens for a user, and it requires the user_id. The parameters also include include_expired, which is optional. Since the user forgot all their tokens, they might need both active and expired ones. But the function's description doesn't mention expired tokens, so maybe it's better to include the include_expired parameter set to true to make sure all tokens are listed.\n\nThen there's the get_shareable_api_tokens function from CustomDashboardsApi. This one is for shareable tokens related to custom dashboards. The user didn't mention anything about dashboards, so maybe this isn't necessary. But just to be thorough, maybe the user has shareable tokens as well. However, the question is about all API tokens, so perhaps both functions should be called.\n\nWait, the user's main request is to retrieve all their API tokens. The first function, get_api_tokens, is for general API tokens, while get_shareable_api_tokens is specific to dashboards. The user might have both types. So, to cover all possibilities, I should call both functions with the user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to true to ensure expired tokens are included.\n\nBut wait, the parameters for get_api_tokens and get_shareable_api_tokens are similar. The first requires user_id (string) and include_expired (boolean). The second also requires user_id (string) and include_expired (boolean). So, calling both functions with the same user_id and include_expired=True would retrieve all tokens, including shareable ones.\n\nHowever, the user might not need the shareable ones, but since they asked for all API tokens, it's safer to include both. So the function calls would be to get_api_tokens and get_shareable_api_tokens, both with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired true.\n\nWait, but the user's ID is given as \"user123\", which is a string. The post_api_token function's user_id is an integer, but that's for creating a token, not retrieving. So for the get functions, the user_id is a string, which matches the provided ID.\n\nSo the correct approach is to call both get_api_tokens and get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to true. That way, the user gets all their tokens, including any expired ones and shareable ones."}

The enabled parameter is optional, but the user didn't mention enabling it, so maybe default to false or omit it. But the function's parameters say enabled is not required. So the required parameters are name, alert_type, threshold, and recipients. \n\nSo putting it all together: name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type is 'error_rate' (assuming), threshold is 0.05, recipients are the two emails. The enabled parameter is optional, so maybe leave it out. \n\nWait, but the user didn't specify the alert_type. Is that a problem? The function requires it, so I need to include it. Since the user mentioned error rate, I'll use 'error_rate' as the alert_type. \n\nSo the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. I think that's all. No other functions are needed here. The user didn't mention enabling it, so no need to call enable_global_application_alert_config. \n\nWait, but maybe the alert_type is different. For example, maybe it's 'threshold' or something else. But without more info, 'error_rate' seems logical. The user might have intended that. So proceed with that."}

Let me check the available functions. There's CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens and api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. The user provided their user ID, which is 12345. The get_shareable_api_tokens function requires a user_id and an optional include_revoked parameter. The get_api_tokens function has include_expired, page, and page_size parameters. Since the user wants all tokens, maybe I should use get_shareable_api_tokens first with include_revoked set to true to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But wait, the get_api_tokens function might be more comprehensive. However, the user's ID is needed for get_shareable_api_tokens. Let me confirm: the get_shareable_api_tokens function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens, which might be a subset. The get_api_tokens function might retrieve all tokens. But the user's ID is required for get_shareable_api_tokens. Since the user provided their user ID, maybe that's the right function. Wait, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter. So perhaps the user is supposed to use get_shareable_api_tokens with their user ID. But the user might not have the include_revoked parameter set, so including that as true would get all tokens. Alternatively, if the user wants all tokens, maybe multiple pages are needed with get_api_tokens, but since the user ID isn't a parameter there, maybe that's not the right function. So the correct function here is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked true. But the user might not have the include_revoked parameter, so maybe just call it with user_id. Wait, the function's parameters: user_id is required, include_revoked is optional. The user wants all tokens, so including revoked ones. So the function call should be get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked true. That's the best approach here."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's \"detail_experience_and_education\" and \"experiences_and_education\". The first one seems to get detailed info on a specific experience or education, while the latter lists all experiences and education. \n\nThe user specified \"education at UNS\", so maybe \"detail_experience_and_education\" is better because they want details on a specific education. The parameters for that function include \"experience_or_education_type\" and \"experience_or_education_name\". The type here would be \"education\", and the name is \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". \n\nWait, but the \"experiences_and_education\" function also has a parameter for include_education. But that function requires a person_id, which I don't have. The user didn't provide a person_id, so maybe that's not the right one. \n\nAlternatively, if I use \"detail_experience_and_education\", I need to set the type to \"education\" and the name to \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". That seems plausible. Let me check the parameters again. The \"experience_or_education_type\" is required, and \"experience_or_education_name\" is optional. Since the user mentioned UNS, including the name would help retrieve the specific education. \n\nSo the function call should be detail_experience_and_education with type \"education\" and name \"Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)\". That should get the details they need."}

The user wants to wake up early for a meeting tomorrow, which is 2023-12-1. They asked to set a reminder for 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are set_alarm and set_countdown. Since the user is asking for a specific time tomorrow, set_alarm seems appropriate because it's for specific times, either with date and time or just time of day. \n\nThe set_alarm function requires the alarm_time parameter. The user provided \"7:00 AM\" and mentioned the date as 2023-12-1. So I should combine the date and time into one string. The format should be 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM AM/PM'. Since the user specified the date, I'll use '2023-12-01 07:00:00' to include both date and time. \n\nAlso, the purpose parameter is optional, but the user mentioned a meeting, so including that would be helpful. The purpose would be 'meeting'. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which might be a typo for \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\". But the date given is 2023-12-1, which is December 1st. Assuming that's correct, the alarm time should be set for that date. \n\nSo the function call would be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'meeting'. \n\nI don't think set_countdown is needed here because the user isn't asking for a duration but a specific time. So the correct function is set_alarm."}
