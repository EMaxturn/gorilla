The problem is that the data_loading function might not return the columns correctly unless the CSV is structured properly. But since the user provided the dataset.csv, I'll assume that the columns are named as such. So I'll proceed with x and y as those columns.\n\nThen, the linear_regression_fit function needs x and y. The parameters are x (list) and y (list). So after loading the data, I need to pass x and y as lists. Also, the return_residuals parameter is optional, defaulting to 'false'.

However, the functions retrieve individual prices. Unless there's a way to combine them, but the functions don't have an average calculation.

The biological.calc_energy function has a default efficiency of 10%, so maybe I don't need to specify it unless required.

Then, calculating the probability for a poker game.\n\nStarting with the painting. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant. The user wants to change the size to 30x40 inches, medium to oil, and dominant color to red. So I need to call the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The current size is in inches, so that's fine. The medium changed from acrylic to oil, and the color from blue to red. So the function call should include these parameters.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The function prediction.evolution requires species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years 100, model 'Darwin'. So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The user wants the probability of getting a royal flush. The probability function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52 cards, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. So the function call here would be calculate_probability with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, check if the parameters are strings. The size is a string, medium and dominant color as strings. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years as an integer, model as a string. For the poker, total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes are integers, round_to is an integer. All parameters are provided, so the function calls should be correct."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The house has an area of 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. So I need to use the predict_house_price function. The parameters required are area, rooms, year, and location. All these are provided, so I can call that function with those values.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the default state is California, but the user specified San Francisco, maybe I should include that. Wait, the function's county is the jurisdiction, so San Francisco county would be the county parameter. So the function call would be lawsuit_search with entity=John Doe, county=San Francisco, state=California.\n\nThen, the probability part. The lottery has total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. The user wants the result rounded to 3 decimal places. So I'll call calculate_probability with total_outcomes=1000, favorable_outcomes=5, and round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly passed. Let me check each function's parameters again. Yes, the house price prediction uses area, rooms, year, location. Lawsuit search uses entity, county, state. Probability uses total, favorable, round_to. All required parameters are present. So I can generate the three function calls in the specified format."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of Apple Inc.'s lawsuits in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: get_collectables_in_season. The game is Animal Crossing, season is Summer, and item_type should be 'fish'. So that's one function call.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The function game_score.highest requires game, platform, and region. So game is Fortnite, platform is Playstation, region Asia. That's another call.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user didn't specify case_type, so maybe default to all. So company is Apple Inc., year 2018, case_type 'all'.\n\nLastly, binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So all parameters are given, so that's the third function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. Let me check each function's required parameters again. Yes, all are covered. No missing parameters. So the four function calls should be sufficient."}
