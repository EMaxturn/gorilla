It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and an optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. Rounding isn't specified, so maybe I can leave it out or set to a default. The function should handle that. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_displacement are all integers.

The function requires them as integers, and the user specified units, but the function doesn't mention units, just numerical values. So passing 7 and 10 as integers should be fine.

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are both given here: 20 meters and 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest, so initial_speed is probably set to 0 by default. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speed and time, but we don't have final speed here. So that's not the right one. \n\nSo the correct function is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4. The initial_speed is not needed since it's starting from rest. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The function's required parameters are distance (integer) and time (integer). The user provided both as 20 and 4, which are integers. So that's all set.

The available functions are dice_roll_probability, flip_coin_probability, and shuffle_card_probability. Since the question is about dice, the dice_roll_probability function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for dice_roll_probability: desired_sum is required, n_rolls is optional with a default of 1, and sides_per_die is required. The user mentioned two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The desired_sum is 7. But wait, the function's default for n_rolls is 1, so I need to explicitly set it to 2. Also, sides_per_die is required. The problem doesn't specify the number of sides, but typically dice have 6 sides. However, the function requires this parameter, so I should assume standard dice unless stated otherwise. So sides_per_die would be 6.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention the number of sides, but the function requires it. So I need to make sure to include that. Since it's not specified, I'll go with the standard 6-sided dice. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. That should cover all required parameters. Let me double-check the function's required fields: desired_sum and sides_per_die are required. Yes, n_rolls is optional. So the function call should include all three parameters.

The parameters required are location, art_form, month, and user_ratings. \n\nThe user specified \"modern sculpture\" as the art form, so art_form should be \"sculpture\". The location is New York. The month is upcoming, so maybe leave it as default or set it to the current month. But the parameter says the default returns upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is better. Also, they want top-rated, so user_ratings should be set to 'high' or the default, which is 'high'. \n\nWait, the user_ratings parameter's default is 'high', so even if not specified, it would default to that. So the function call would need location as \"New York, NY\", art_form as \"sculpture\", and maybe month as the upcoming month. But the user says \"upcoming month\", which might mean the next month. However, the parameter's default is to return upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is okay. Let me check the function's description again.

So the function call would be:\n\nfind_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", month=\"upcoming\", user_ratings=\"high\")? Wait, the month parameter's description says the default is upcoming events. So if the user says \"upcoming month\", maybe the month parameter should be set to the current month's name, but the function's default handles upcoming events. Hmm, maybe the user just wants the upcoming events, so not specifying the month would be better. So the parameters would be location: \"New York, NY\", art_form: \"sculpture\", and user_ratings: \"high\". \n\nI think that's all. The other functions don't seem relevant here.
