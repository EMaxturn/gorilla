We are not given a unit, so we can use the default (which is not specified in the function, but we can leave it out) or choose one. Since the user didn't specify, we can use the default or choose Celsius or Fahrenheit. However, in the US, Fahrenheit is common. But note: the function does not specify the default unit. To be safe, we can either not specify (so the function uses its default) or set to Fahrenheit. Since the locations are in the US, let's set unit to 'fahrenheit'. But note: the function description does not specify the allowed units. We'll assume it accepts 'celsius' and 'fahrenheit'. Alternatively, we can call without specifying and hope the default is Fahrenheit. However, the problem says if parameters are missing we must point it out, but here unit is optional. We'll set it to 'fahrenheit' to be explicit.\n\n We'll make two function calls: one for Boston, MA and one for San Francisco.\n\n Note: The function expects the location in the format 'City, State' with the state in short form.

The user mentioned two separate eating occasions.\n First occasion (earlier): two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\n Second occasion: 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea.\n\n We have a function `log_food` that can log each food item. We need to log each food item separately.\n\n Steps:\n 1. For the first occasion (earlier): \n    - Food: pepperoni pizza, portion: 2 slices.\n    - Food: coffee, portion: 1 [unit?]. The user didn't specify the amount for coffee, but we can assume one serving.\n\n 2. For the second occasion (current):\n    - Food: frozen mango, portion: 8 pieces.\n    - Food: chai tea, portion: 1 [unit?]. Similarly, we assume one serving.\n\n However, note that the function requires `portion_amount` and `portion_unit`. \n For pizza and mango, we have clear units: \"slices\" and \"pieces\". \n For coffee and chai tea, the user didn't specify the amount. Since it's common to log a single serving, we can use:\n    - coffee: 1 cup (or just 1 serving? but the function requires a unit). The function expects a unit. We can use \"cup\" for coffee and chai tea.\n\n But note: the function has an optional `meal_type` and `log_date`. The user didn't specify the meal type or exact time.\n\n We can do:\n   - For the earlier meal, we don't have a date, so we can leave `log_date` out. Similarly for the current one, we can leave it to default to now?\n   - The problem says: if the given question lacks parameters, point it out. However, the function allows `meal_type` and `log_date` to be optional.\n\n Approach:\n   We can log each food item with the information we have. For the coffee and chai tea, we'll assume 1 cup.\n\n However, note the user said \"a coffee\" and \"a chai tea\", so we can use:\n   - coffee: portion_amount=1, portion_unit='cup'\n   - chai tea: portion_amount=1, portion_unit='cup'\n\n But wait, the function requires the parameters to be provided. We have to make sure we have the required ones.\n\n We'll log each food item in two separate function calls for the two occasions.\n\n However, the function does not have a parameter to group the foods of the same meal together? So we can log each independently.\n\n But note: the function has an optional `meal_type`. We can set the meal_type for the foods of the same occasion to the same type? But the user didn't specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can log without meal_type.\n\n Since the user mentioned two separate occasions, we can set the `log_date` for the earlier one to be in the past? But we don't know exactly when.\n\n How about:\n   - For the earlier meal: we don't have a date, so we skip `log_date`. We also skip `meal_type`.\n   - For the current meal: we skip `log_date` (so it will default to now) and skip `meal_type`.\n\n However, the problem says: if the given question lacks the parameters, point it out. But note that `log_date` and `meal_type` are optional. So we can skip them.\n\n But to be more accurate, we can try to set the `log_date` for the earlier meal? The user said \"earlier\", but we don't know the exact time. We cannot invent a time. So we leave it out.\n\n Therefore, we will log four food items:\n\n 1. pepperoni pizza: portion_amount=2, portion_unit='slice'\n 2. coffee: portion_amount=1, portion_unit='cup'\n 3. frozen mango: portion_amount=8, portion_unit='piece'\n 4. chai tea: portion_amount=1, portion_unit='cup'\n\n We'll make four function calls.\n\n However, note: the function call format is XML.
