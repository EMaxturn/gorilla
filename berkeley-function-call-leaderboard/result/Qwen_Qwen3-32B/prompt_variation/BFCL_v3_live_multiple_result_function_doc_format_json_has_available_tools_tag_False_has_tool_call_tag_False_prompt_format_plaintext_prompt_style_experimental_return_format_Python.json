The user is asking for an Uber ride. They specified the type as 'Plus', the address as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', and a maximum wait time of 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. There are two functions listed: uber.ride and uber.ride2. Let me look at their parameters.\n\nFor uber.ride, the required parameters are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be in 'Street Address, City, State' format. The user provided '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. So that's all set.\n\nNow, uber.ride2 also has loc and type, but the loc is in 'City, State' format. The user's address includes the street, so ride2's loc format doesn't match. Also, ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user explicitly said 10. However, since ride requires all three parameters, and the user provided all, ride is the correct one here. So I should use uber.ride with the given parameters."}

The language isn't specified, but the default is EN. However, since the keyword is in Korean, maybe the user prefers results in Korean. But the function's language parameter options are EN, ES, FR, DE. Hmm, the user didn't specify language, so default to EN. But the search might still return Korean content if the keyword is in Korean. Wait, the function's description says it's for retrieving up-to-date info using keywords, so it should handle Korean keywords. The result_format is text, which matches the user's request. So the correct function call is HNA_WQA.search with keyword='\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format='text', max_results=10. The language parameter can be left as default unless specified, but the user didn't mention language preference.

The user is asking for an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for a specific period. They provided the account number, name, dates, and some financial figures.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The user mentioned U.S. Bank, the account number is given, the account type is checking, and the full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. For the transaction overview, they provided start_date, end_date, total_deposits, and total_withdrawals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dictionary that includes total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, and end_date. The user's numbers are $7,132.76 for deposits and $5,927.40 for withdrawals. The dates are October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. So I need to format those dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The start_date would be '2019-10-01' and end_date '2019-10-31'.\n\nAlso, the user wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function might be needed. It requires transactions, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But wait, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, just the totals. The Alltransactions function could retrieve the transactions for the statement period. The statement_period would be '2019-10', and include_pending might be False by default. But the user didn't specify if they want pending transactions, so maybe stick with the default.\n\nBut the user is asking for a summary that includes individual transactions. However, without the actual transaction details, maybe the Alltransactions function is needed first to get the list, then pass that to transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, perhaps the system can't generate them. Wait, the user might expect that the functions can retrieve the data. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe Alltransactions function retrieves a list of all transactions for a specified statement period. So if I call Alltransactions with statement_period '2019-10', that would get the transactions. Then, use that list in the transaction_summary.generate function. But the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the system can't generate them. However, the user is asking for a summary, so perhaps the functions are designed to handle that.\n\nBut looking at the parameters for transaction_summary.generate, it requires a list of transactions. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the assistant can't generate it. However, the user might expect that the Alltransactions function is used to get the transactions first. So first, call Alltransactions for October 2019, then use that data in the transaction_summary.generate. But the user's question is a single request, so maybe the assistant should generate both function calls in sequence.\n\nWait, the user's main request is to provide an overview using the given data. The BankStatementOverView function can handle the overview part. The transaction_summary.generate might need the transactions array, which isn't provided. But the user might have intended that the Alltransactions function is used to get the transactions. However, the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, so maybe the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the Alltransactions function to retrieve the transactions for the period, then pass that to the transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't know them. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user provided the total deposits and withdrawals, but not individual transactions. The Alltransactions function would need to be called to get the list. But since the user is asking for a summary that includes the transactions, perhaps the assistant should first call Alltransactions to get the transactions, then use that in the transaction_summary. However, in the absence of actual data, the assistant can't generate the transactions. So maybe the assistant should call Alltransactions first, then use the result in the transaction_summary. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't know them. Therefore, perhaps the assistant can only generate the BankStatementOverView and note that the transaction summary requires the Alltransactions data. But the user might expect that the functions are called in sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the transaction_summary can be generated with the totals provided. But the transaction_summary.generate function requires individual transactions. Since the user hasn't provided them, the assistant can't generate that part. Therefore, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView with the provided data and then call Alltransactions to get the transactions for the summary. But the user's question is a single request, so the assistant should generate both function calls.\n\nWait, the user's question is to provide an overview and include a summary of transactions. The overview can be done with BankStatementOverView. The summary of transactions would require the Alltransactions function to get the list, then pass that to transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the actual transactions, the assistant can't generate the summary. However, the assistant can call Alltransactions to retrieve the transactions for the period, then use that in the summary. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided data.\n2. Call Alltransactions for the statement period (October 2019) to get the transactions.\n3. Call transaction_summary.generate with the transactions and other parameters.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the transactions, so the assistant can't know them. Therefore, the assistant can only call the first two functions and then the third one if the transactions are available. However, in the context of the problem, the assistant is to generate the function calls based on the user's input. Since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't generate the transaction_summary.generate call without the transactions array. Therefore, the assistant should call BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions, and then perhaps note that the transaction summary can't be generated without the individual transactions. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should generate the function calls. So the assistant should generate the BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions calls. Then, once Alltransactions is called, the transactions can be used in the transaction_summary.generate. But since the user hasn't provided the transactions, the assistant can't proceed further. Therefore, the correct function calls are BankStatementOverView and Alltransactions."}

Alternatively, maybe the user didn't specify, so I need to handle that. But the function requires 'category' to be one of the listed options. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should make an assumption or maybe the function allows a default? Wait, the parameters don't mention a default for category. So this is an issue. The user's query is missing the category, which is required. How to handle this?\n\nWait, maybe the user didn't specify a category, so I need to ask for clarification, but since I have to generate a function call, perhaps I can use a general category like 'American' or 'Bistro'? But that's making an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the function allows a wildcard, but the enum doesn't have a 'any' option. Hmm. Since the function requires a category, and the user didn't provide one, perhaps I should pick a common one, but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave it out, but the function can't proceed without it. Wait, the user's original request is to find restaurants with intermediate pricing and outdoor seating in New York. Since category is required, perhaps the assistant should make a best guess. Maybe 'American' is a safe default? Or maybe the user expects a variety, but the function requires a single category. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to include the category. Since the function requires it, I need to include it. But without knowing, perhaps the assistant should proceed with a common category. Alternatively, maybe the function allows a blank, but according to the parameters, it's required. So perhaps the correct approach is to use a placeholder, but the enum requires a specific value. \n\nWait, maybe the user didn't specify the category, so the assistant can't proceed. But the user might expect that the category is optional. However, according to the function definition, 'category' is required. Therefore, the assistant needs to include it. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the assistant should make an assumption. For example, maybe the user is looking for a general restaurant, so perhaps 'American' is a safe bet. Alternatively, maybe the user wants a variety, but the function can only take one category. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can call the function with a default category, but the function doesn't have a default. So this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user intended to say 'any category' but the function requires a specific one. In that case, the assistant might need to make a choice. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should return an error, but the instructions say to generate function calls if possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's query is missing the category, so the assistant should proceed with a default. Wait, looking back at the function parameters for Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants, the 'category' is required and has an enum list. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the assistant should pick one. For example, maybe 'American' is a common choice. So I'll proceed with that. So the parameters would be category='American', location='New York, NY', price_range='moderate', has_seating_outdoors=True. The other parameters like has_vegetarian_options are optional and default to False, which is okay. \n\nSo the function call would be Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants with those parameters. That should fulfill the user's request."}

However, the user didn't specify the location or the place_name. The location is required, so I need to ask for that. Also, place_name is required but the user hasn't provided it.

Wait, maybe I should check if they need to search first using Hotels_4_SearchHotel to find available hotels, then reserve. But the user's message is to \"book\", so maybe they already have a specific hotel in mind. However, they didn't mention the hotel name or location. Without the location, I can't proceed with the reservation. So the correct step is to inform the user that the location and place_name are missing. But the user might not know the exact hotel yet. Perhaps they need to search first. But the user's instruction is to book, so maybe they expect me to use the reserve function. However, since required parameters are missing, I should indicate that. Wait, the required parameters for Hotels_4_ReserveHotel are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, and location. The user provided check_in_date (July 15th) and stay_length (5 days), but not place_name or location. So the function call can't be made without those. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the required parameters are missing. But the user might have intended to provide more info. Alternatively, maybe the location is implied by the studio sessions. But the user hasn't specified where the studio is. So I need to ask for the location and hotel name. Since the user hasn't provided them, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the required parameters are missing."}

But the function allows specifying artist, but since the user didn't mention it, maybe just use the album. \n\nNext, the release year. The user says around six years ago, which is 2017. The function's year parameter has an enum that includes '2017', so set that. Also, the genre isn't specified, so set to 'dontcare'. \n\nWait, the user wants songs similar to the album, so maybe the artist of that album is important. But since the user didn't mention the artist, maybe the function can still find based on album name. Alternatively, if the album 'The New Classic' is by a specific artist, but the user didn't specify. Hmm. The function's album parameter is a string, so inputting 'The New Classic' should work. \n\nSo the parameters would be album='The New Classic', year='2017', and others as default. Let me check the function's parameters again. The Music_3_LookupMusic function has parameters artist, album, genre, year. All can be set except required none. So the call would be Music_3_LookupMusic(album='The New Classic', year='2017'). \n\nWait, the user wants songs similar to the album, so maybe the function uses that to find similar ones. Also, the release year around six years ago is 2017. So combining both in one function call. That should cover both parts of the request. I think that's the correct approach."}

The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. \n\nLooking at Music_3_PlayMedia, it requires a track name, and optionally artist, device, and album. But the user hasn't specified a particular track; they want either from the album or from 2019. So maybe first, I should use Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs that match either the album 'High Expectations' or the year 2019.\n\nThe Music_3_LookupMusic function allows filtering by artist, album, genre, and year. The user specified the album 'High Expectations' and the year 2019. But how to handle the \"or\" condition? The function parameters don't have an explicit 'or' option. The parameters are separate fields for album and year. If I set album to 'High Expectations' and year to 2019, does the function interpret that as an OR or an AND? The description says \"match the user's specified preferences such as artist, album, genre, and release year.\" The wording \"such as\" suggests that the parameters can be combined, but it's not clear if it's OR or AND. However, since the user is saying \"or alternatively,\" they probably want songs that are either from that album or from that year. \n\nBut the function might not support OR logic directly. In that case, maybe we need to make two separate calls: one for the album and one for the year. However, the user might want a single list. Alternatively, perhaps the function allows multiple criteria, and the system combines them as OR. For example, if you specify both album and year, it might return songs that match either. But I'm not sure. The function's parameters don't specify how multiple filters are combined. \n\nAssuming that the function combines them as OR, then setting album='High Expectations' and year='2019' would return songs that are either from that album or from 2019. But if it's AND, then it would be songs from that album and from 2019. Since the user wants either, maybe we need to make two separate calls. However, the user might prefer a single call. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic are none, so we can specify both album and year. Let's proceed with that. \n\nSo, the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019'. The other parameters like artist and genre can be set to 'dontcare' as defaults. Then, once we get the list of songs from the lookup, we can use Music_3_PlayMedia to play one of them. But the user hasn't specified which track, so maybe after looking up, the system would need to present the options and then play one. However, the current task is to generate the function calls. Since the user hasn't specified a particular track, the first step is to look up the songs, and then perhaps play one. But the user's request is to \"hear a track,\" so maybe the assistant should first look up the songs and then play one. However, the user hasn't specified which one, so the assistant might need to choose, but the function requires a specific track. \n\nWait, the user's request is to \"hear a track from the album 'High Expectations', or alternatively, any song that came out in 2019.\" So the user is giving two options. The assistant needs to find songs that meet either condition and then play one. But since the user hasn't specified a particular song, the assistant might need to first retrieve the list using Music_3_LookupMusic and then select a track to play. However, the user's current input is a request to hear a track, so perhaps the assistant should first look up the songs and then play one. But the user hasn't specified which track, so the assistant might need to make an assumption or ask for clarification. However, the task here is to generate the function calls based on the user's input. \n\nGiven that, the first step is to use Music_3_LookupMusic with album='High Expectations' and year='2019' to get a list of songs. Then, once that list is obtained, the assistant can use Music_3_PlayMedia to play a specific track. However, since the user hasn't specified a track, the assistant might need to select one from the lookup results. But in the current step, the user hasn't provided enough information to call PlayMedia directly. Therefore, the correct function call is to first perform the lookup. \n\nSo the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic(album='High Expectations', year='2019'). The other parameters like artist and genre are set to their defaults ('dontcare'). Then, once the lookup is done, the system can proceed to play a track. But in this step, the user hasn't specified a track, so the assistant can't call PlayMedia yet. Therefore, the correct function call is the LookupMusic with the specified parameters."}

The event_type can be 'Music' or 'Theater', which matches the user's request. The city is New York, so I'll format it as 'New York, NY'. The date is March 10th, which should be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so '2024-03-10' (assuming the current year, but maybe the user meant this year or next? Well, the input is March 10th, so I'll go with that format).\n\nThe function's parameters have a default for date as 'dontcare', but the user specified a date, so I need to set it to '2024-03-10'. The event_type should be both 'Music' and 'Theater', but the function's enum only allows one at a time. Wait, the function's parameters require event_type to be either 'Music' or 'Theater', not both. So maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. But the user said \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so they might want either. However, the function can only take one event_type per call. \n\nHmm, the user might want both types, but the function can't handle multiple types in one call. So perhaps I should make two separate calls: one with event_type='Music' and another with event_type='Theater', both with the same city and date. That way, the user gets all possible events of both types. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle multiple function calls. Let me check the instructions again. The user says \"preferably a music concert or a play\", so they might be open to either. Since the function can't take both in one call, I need to make two separate calls. \n\nWait, but the user might not want to have to deal with two separate queries. However, according to the function's parameters, each call is for a specific event_type. So to cover both possibilities, two function calls are necessary. \n\nSo the first call would be Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Music', city='New York, NY', date='2024-03-10'), and the second call would be Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Theater', city='New York, NY', date='2024-03-10'). \n\nBut wait, the date parameter's default is 'dontcare', but the user specified March 10th, so we need to set date='2024-03-10'.

The user wants to book a house in Austin, TX for four men over 18 from May 12th to 18th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's Hotels_2_SearchHouse and Hotels_2_BookHouse. The user is asking to book a house, but before booking, they might need to search for available houses. However, the user's message directly says \"book a house,\" so maybe they already have a selection. But the system might need to search first to find available options. Wait, the user hasn't mentioned selecting a specific house, so the correct process would be to first search for available houses that meet their criteria, then book one. But the user's instruction is to generate function calls to fulfill the request. Since they mentioned booking, maybe the assistant should check if the necessary parameters for booking are present. \n\nLooking at the parameters for Hotels_2_BookHouse: where_to, number_of_adults, check_in_date, check_out_date. The user provided all these: where_to is Austin, TX, number_of_adults is 4, check_in is 05/12/2023, check_out is 05/18/2023. So technically, the booking function can be called directly. However, in real scenarios, you usually search first to select a house. But the user hasn't mentioned searching, just booking. Maybe they assume there's a selected house already. But since the functions are separate, the assistant might need to first search to find available houses before booking. However, the user hasn't indicated that they need to search; they just want to book. But without knowing which house to book, the system might need to search. But the user's message is a direct request to book, so perhaps the assistant should proceed with the booking function, assuming that the necessary house is already selected. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should first call the search function to find available houses and then book. But the user hasn't specified any additional criteria beyond the basic info. The search function has optional parameters like has_laundry_service, rating, etc., which the user didn't mention. Since the user didn't specify those, maybe the assistant can proceed directly to booking with the given parameters. Wait, the booking function requires the house to be selected, but the user hasn't provided a specific house. Hmm, maybe the booking function here is designed to book based on the criteria, not a specific house. But looking at the function descriptions: Hotels_2_BookHouse says \"Book the selected house for given dates...\" which implies that a house has already been selected. Therefore, the correct process would be to first search for houses using Hotels_2_SearchHouse, then book the selected one. But the user hasn't mentioned searching, so perhaps the assistant should first call the search function with the available parameters. However, the user's message is to book, so maybe they expect the booking to happen directly. This is a bit ambiguous. \n\nGiven the functions available, if the user wants to book, but hasn't selected a house, the assistant might need to first search. But the user hasn't provided any search criteria beyond the location, dates, and number of adults. The search function requires 'where_to' and has optional parameters like has_laundry_service, number_of_adults, rating. The user specified the number of adults (4), so including that in the search. The default rating is 3.0, which is acceptable unless the user wants a higher rating, but they didn't specify. So the assistant should call Hotels_2_SearchHouse with where_to='Austin, TX', number_of_adults=4. Then, once the search results are obtained, the user can select a house, and then book. But since the user's request is to book, maybe the assistant should proceed with the booking function, assuming that the house is already selected. However, the booking function doesn't take parameters like house ID or name, which is a problem. The function as described seems to require that the house is already selected, but the parameters don't include a house identifier. This is confusing. \n\nWait, looking back at the function definitions: Hotels_2_BookHouse's parameters are where_to, number_of_adults, check_in_date, check_out_date. It doesn't include a house ID, which suggests that the function might be designed to book any available house that matches the criteria, but that's not typical. Usually, booking requires selecting a specific house. The function's description says \"Book the selected house,\" which implies that the house is already selected. Therefore, the assistant might need to first search for houses, then book. But the user hasn't mentioned searching. Given that, perhaps the assistant should first call the search function with the available parameters, then proceed to book. However, the user's message is a direct request to book, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the booking function, even if it's not the typical workflow. Alternatively, the assistant might need to inform the user that a search is required first, but according to the problem statement, the assistant should generate function calls. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the parameters provided by the user, the booking function can be called with the given parameters. The user provided all required parameters for the booking function: where_to, number_of_adults (4), check_in_date, check_out_date. So the assistant can call Hotels_2_BookHouse with those parameters. However, in reality, this might not work because the booking function likely needs a specific house ID. But given the function definitions provided, the assistant must work with what's available. Therefore, the correct function call is Hotels_2_BookHouse with the provided parameters."}

So the function call would be Restaurants_2_ReserveRestaurant with restaurant_name='Balthazar', location='New York, NY', time='20:00', date='2023-10-13', number_of_seats=4. However, since the actual current date isn't provided, the assistant might not know the correct date. But the user is asking for \"this Friday,\" so the assistant must infer it. Therefore, the correct function call is to use the ReserveRestaurant function with the parameters as specified, converting the date to ISO format and time to 24-hour format."}

The Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function is for reserving tickets. The required parameters are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. \n\nThe user specified the date as May 15, 2023, but the journey starts one day before. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The date_of_journey is May 15, but the start time is one day before? Or does the journey start on the 15th, and the start time is the time on that day? The user says \"starting at one day before,\" which might mean the start time is the day before the journey date. But the date_of_journey is May 15, so maybe the journey starts on the 15th, and the start time is the time on that day. However, the user's wording is unclear. Maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14th? But that's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before.\" So the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before that date? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps they meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But the user says \"starting at one day before,\" which is ambiguous. Maybe they meant the start time is the day before the journey date? But the date_of_journey is May 15, so the start time would be May 14. But that's not possible because the date_of_journey is May 15. This is a problem. The function requires date_of_journey in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and journey_start_time in 'HH:MM'. \n\nAssuming the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 15, and the start time is a specific time on that day, perhaps they meant to say the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But the user's instruction is unclear. However, since the user mentioned \"starting at one day before,\" maybe they intended the journey to start on May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is the day before, which is not possible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Since the function requires date_of_journey as the date of the journey, and journey_start_time as the time on that date, I'll proceed with the given date, May 15, 2023, and assume the start time is a specific time on that day. However, the user's mention of \"one day before\" is confusing. Maybe they meant the check-in is a day before, but for train tickets, the start time is on the journey date. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and set the journey_start_time to a default time, perhaps 08:00, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the user didn't provide the actual start time, just \"starting at one day before.\" This is a problem because the function requires journey_start_time. Without that, the function can't be called. \n\nBut the user might have made a mistake. Maybe they meant the journey is on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. Since the user didn't specify the exact time, perhaps I should ask for clarification. However, the task is to generate function calls based on the given information. Since the user didn't provide the start time, but the function requires it, this is a missing parameter. \n\nWait, the user's query says \"starting at one day before,\" which might be a mistake. Maybe they meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is the day before, which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe they meant the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. This is conflicting. \n\nIn this case, since the required parameters are missing (journey_start_time), the function can't be called. However, the user might have intended to provide the start time but made an error. Since the user hasn't provided the start time, I can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameter journey_start_time is missing. \n\nBut wait, the user might have intended to say the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. Since the user didn't specify, but the function requires it, the function call can't be made. Therefore, the answer should state that the journey_start_time is missing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to say the journey is on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM, and the \"one day before\" is a mistake. In that case, I can proceed by assuming a default start time. However, the function doesn't have a default for journey_start_time. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user's instruction says to generate function calls if possible. If the required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this. \n\nSo, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), date_of_journey (May 15, 2023), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (True), and _class (Business). However, journey_start_time is missing. \n\nTherefore, the function call can't be made because journey_start_time is required. The user needs to provide the start time. \n\nBut the user's query says \"starting at one day before,\" which is ambiguous. Maybe they meant the start time is the day before the journey date, but that's not possible because the date_of_journey is May 15. So the start time would have to be on May 15. \n\nIn conclusion, the function call can't be made due to missing journey_start_time. However, the user might have intended to provide a specific time but made a mistake in the description. Since the user hasn't provided the start time, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the journey_start_time is missing."}

The user provided the user_id as 12345, so that's covered.

The user didn't specify anything about pages, but to get all tokens, we might need to paginate. However, the default page_size is 20, and the user might not know how many pages there are. But since the user wants all, maybe we should set a larger page_size, but the maximum allowed is 100. However, the function's default is 20. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just use the default parameters. Wait, but the user wants all tokens. If there are more than 20, the default page would miss some. But without knowing the total number of pages, the function might need to be called multiple times. However, the user is asking for all tokens now, so perhaps the system should handle pagination. But the current functions don't automatically handle that. Since the user can't specify page numbers, maybe the best we can do is retrieve the first page with default parameters. Alternatively, maybe set page_size to the maximum allowed (100) to get as many as possible in one call. But the user might need to handle pagination themselves. Since the user hasn't provided any info on how many pages, perhaps we proceed with the default parameters. However, the user wants all tokens, so maybe include_expired=True to include expired ones, and set page_size to 100 to maximize the number retrieved. But the user might not have that many. \n\nWait, the user's main goal is to get all their API tokens. So for both functions, we should use parameters that ensure we get as much as possible. For get_shareable_api_tokens, include_revoked=True to get all shareable tokens, including revoked. For get_api_tokens, include_expired=True to include expired tokens, and set page_size=100 to get the maximum per page. But the user might need to check multiple pages if there are more than 100 tokens. However, the user hasn't specified any page numbers, so maybe just retrieve the first page with the maximum page size. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\nCustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens(user_id=\"12345\", include_revoked=True)\napi_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens(include_expired=True, page=1, page_size=100)\n\nThis way, both functions are called with parameters that aim to retrieve all possible tokens. The user can then check the results and possibly make additional calls if there are more pages, but that's beyond the current scope. The user's immediate request is to get all tokens now, so these two calls should cover the available functions."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' which requires the 'experience_or_education_type'. The enum for that parameter includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. Perfect, that matches the user's query. \n\nThe parameters needed are 'experience_or_education_type' and optionally 'experience_or_education_name'. Since the user specified the education at UNS, I'll set the type to that. The name isn't mentioned, so it can default to 'Not specified' as per the function's default. \n\nI should call the 'detail_experience_and_education' function with the type set to 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. No other parameters are necessary here. Let me make sure there's no other function that might fit better. The 'experiences_and_education' function requires a person_id, which the user hasn't provided. So the correct choice is definitely 'detail_experience_and_education'."}
{"id": "live_multiple_1051-278-0", "result": "[set_alarm(alarm_time='2023-12-01 07:00:00', purpose='meeting')]", "input_token_count": 704, "output_token_count": 360, "latency": 18.970548391342163, "reasoning_content": "Okay, the user wants to set a reminder for 7:00 AM tomorrow, December 1, 2023. Let me check the available functions. There's set_alarm which takes an alarm_time and purpose. The alarm_time needs to be in a standard format. The user specified the date as 2023-12-1, which is a valid date format. Combining that with 7:00 AM, the full time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' in 24-hour format, but since the user used AM, maybe it's better to use '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. The function's parameters accept both 12-hour with AM/PM and 24-hour formats. The purpose is for a meeting, so I'll include that. The default purpose is 'reminder', but the user mentioned a meeting, so specifying 'meeting' makes sense. So the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time='2023-12-01 7:00 AM' and purpose='meeting'. I need to make sure the date is correctly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. The user wrote 'tomorro 2023-12-1', which I assume is a typo for tomorrow, December 1, 2023. Since the current date isn't provided, I'll take the user's input at face value. Alright, that should cover it."}
