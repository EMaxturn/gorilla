The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height is given as 150 meters. The initial velocity is specified as zero, which matches the default value in the function parameters. The gravity isn't mentioned, so it should use the default of 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, I should call the function with height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81.

Since the function's parameter is called start_date, it's likely that it's the starting point, so if the user wants after January 1, maybe the start_date is 01-01-2021 and the function's query would be >= that date. But the user's wording is \"after,\" which could mean strictly after. However, without more info, I'll proceed with the date as given by the user, using 01-01-2021 as the start_date.

Let me check the available functions. There's find_recipe which takes recipeName and maxCalories. The required parameter is recipeName, and maxCalories has a default of 1000. Since the user specified less than 500, I need to set maxCalories to 500. So I'll call find_recipe with recipeName='pasta carbonara' and maxCalories=500."}

The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel in Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function requires location, room_type, duration, start_date, and optional preferences. The parameters provided by the user include location (Manhattan, New York), room_type (single), duration (3 nights), start_date (March 10th, 2023), and preferences (pet_friendly). \n\nThe preferences parameter is an array of strings from the enum. The user specified \"pet friendly\", which matches the 'pet_friendly' enum value. So I should include that in the preferences array. The other preferences like gym, swimming_pool, etc., aren't mentioned, so only pet_friendly is needed. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. Location, room_type, duration, and start_date are all provided. The date format for start_date should be a string, probably in YYYY-MM-DD format. The user said March 10th, 2023, which would be '2023-03-10'. \n\nSo the function call should be hotel_booking with those parameters. Let me structure it correctly."}
