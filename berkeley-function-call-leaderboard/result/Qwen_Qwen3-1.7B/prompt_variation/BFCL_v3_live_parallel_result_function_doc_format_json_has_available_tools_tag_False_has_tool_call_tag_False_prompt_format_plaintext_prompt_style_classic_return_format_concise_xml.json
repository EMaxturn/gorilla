The user mentioned two cities, so I need to call each function once for each city.\n\nFirst, for Boston. The parameters are location and unit. The default unit is Fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify, so I can use the default. So call get_current_weather with location \"Boston\" and unit \"fahrenheit\".\n\nThen, for San Francisco. Same approach. Call get_current_weather with location \"San Francisco\" and unit \"fahrenheit\". \n\nI should make sure to use the correct function names and parameters. The user didn't mention snow, so maybe get_snow_report isn't needed here. But since the question is about weather in general, both functions could be relevant. However, the user didn't specify snow, so perhaps just current weather is sufficient. But the functions are separate, so I should call both if needed. Wait, the user asked for the weather in both cities, so both functions are applicable. So I need to call get_current_weather for each city. \n\nSo the function calls would be two separate calls: one for Boston and one for San Francisco using get_current_weather. The unit is default, so no need to specify unless the user wants it changed. Since the user didn't mention, stick with default."}

All the necessary parameters are mentioned in the user's query. \n\nFor the first reservation: hotel_name is Sheraton, location is New York, check_in is May 1, 2022, check_out is May 5, 2022.

Adults 1, children 2. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls. Each function call should have the parameters as specified. The dates need to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. Let me verify the dates. May 1, 2022 is 2022-05-01, and May 5 is 2022-05-05. Similarly, June 1 is 2022-06-01 and June 10 is 2022-06-10. \n\nNo parameters are missing here.

The user said \"8 pieces of frozen mango,\" so food_name is \"frozen mango,\" portion_amount is 8, portion_unit is \"piece.\" The meal_type is \"snack\" by default, but since they mentioned it as a snack, that's fine.

The user had two slices, so portion_amount is 2, portion_unit is \"slice,\" food_name is \"pepperoni pizza,\" meal_type is \"snack\" again. Log_date defaults to None.\n\nThen, the coffee.
