It's completely unrelated to exhibitions or sculptures.\n\n2. **find_exhibition**: This is for locating popular exhibitions based on criteria like location, art form, month, and user ratings. This seems relevant.\n\n3. **get_sculpture_info**: This retrieves information about a specific sculpture by an artist, including year and details. It's not about exhibitions; it's about individual artworks.\n\nThe most appropriate function is **find_exhibition** because it deals with exhibitions and allows specifying location, art form, month, and user ratings.\n\nLet's map the user's query to the function's parameters:\n\n- **location**: The user specified \"New York\". I can use that directly, e.g., \"New York, NY\" as per the example.\n\n- **art_form**: The user said \"modern sculpture\". Is \"modern sculpture\" an art form? The function description says e.g., \"sculpture\", so I can use \"sculpture\" and perhaps specify it's modern if possible. But the parameter is just \"art_form\", so I'll use \"sculpture\" as it's the closest match.\n\n- **month**: The user said \"in the upcoming month\". The function says \"month\" with default for upcoming events. It states: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, if I don't specify, it might return upcoming ones. To be precise, I could leave it out or specify if needed. Since it's \"upcoming month\", using the default should work.\n\n- **user_ratings**: The user said \"top rated\", which implies high user ratings. The function has \"user_ratings\" with default 'high'. So, I can use the default or specify 'high'.\n\nTo get the top rated, I should set user_ratings to 'high' or whatever threshold is appropriate. The description says \"Select exhibitions with user rating threshold. Default is 'high'\", so default should suffice for top rated.\n\nMy function call should include:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\"\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (assuming modern is a subset, but I'll go with this)\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will use default for upcoming events.\n\n- user_ratings: Default to 'high'\n\nI need to format this as a TOOLCALL.\n\nThe format is strict:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n\n<params>\n\n<param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<param name=\"art_form\" value=\"sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n\n<!-- If needed, add others -->\n\n</params>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should only include parameters that are necessary. Since month defaults to upcoming, I don't need to specify it. User_ratings defaults to 'high', which matches \"top rated\".\n\nSo, I'll call **find_exhibition** with location and art_form.\n\nIs \"modern sculpture\" exactly \"sculpture\"? The function might not have a specific field for \"modern\", so I'll use \"sculpture\" and rely on the other filters.\n\nThis seems to be the best match. I don't need to chain functions; this one should suffice.\n\nFinally, my response should ONLY be the TOOLCALL section."}
