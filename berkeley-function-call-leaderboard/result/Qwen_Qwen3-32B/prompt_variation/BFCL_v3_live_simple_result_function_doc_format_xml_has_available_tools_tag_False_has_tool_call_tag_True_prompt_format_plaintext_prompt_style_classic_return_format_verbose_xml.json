The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example has {ip} as a placeholder, so I should replace that with the actual IP provided by the user, which is 192.120.45.67.\n\nThe parameters for the GET request are a dict. The user's parameters are fabricName: Network1, nodeId: 12, podId: 10, interfaceType: Ethernet, infoType: Speed. These should be included in the params dictionary. \n\nI need to make sure that the URL is correctly formatted. The example in the function uses {ip}, so replacing that with the user's IP. The rest of the URL path seems to be fixed. So the url parameter would be 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nThen, the params dict should include all the user's parameters.

The keys should be the parameter names as specified, and the values as provided. \n\nWait, the user's parameters are Parameter_fabricName, Parameter_nodeId, etc. But in the function's params, the keys would just be the parameter names without the \"Parameter_\" prefix. Or does the API expect those exact names? The user mentioned the parameters as Parameter_fabricName, but maybe the actual parameter names in the API are fabricName, nodeId, etc. So I should use the names without the \"Parameter_\" part. For example, the key is \"fabricName\" and the value is \"Network1\".\n\nSo the params dict would be:\n{\n  \"fabricName\": \"Network1\",\n  \"nodeId\": 12,\n  \"podId\": 10,\n  \"interfaceType\": \"Ethernet\",\n  \"infoType\": \"Speed\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the function's params are of type dict, and the values can be of different types. The nodeId and podId are integers, others are strings. So in the function call, the params should be correctly formatted with the right types. The user provided nodeId as 12 and podId as 10, which are integers. The infoType is Speed, which is a string. InterfaceType is Ethernet, also a string. FabricName is Network1, a string.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function call would use the requests.get function with the url constructed with the IP and the params as the dictionary with those key-value pairs. I need to make sure that the URL is correctly formed. The example in the function's description shows the base path, so I don't need to add any query parameters to the URL.
