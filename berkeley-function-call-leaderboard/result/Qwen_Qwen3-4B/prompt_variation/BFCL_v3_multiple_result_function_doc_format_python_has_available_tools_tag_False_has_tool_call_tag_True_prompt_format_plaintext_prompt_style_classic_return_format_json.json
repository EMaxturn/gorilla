The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price, I should use store_price. The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided, so I can call store_price with these values. The other functions don't relate to price directly, so they aren't needed here.

Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the final speed. The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4. The initial_speed is optional and defaults to 0, so even if not provided, it's okay. But the user mentioned starting from rest, so explicitly setting initial_speed to 0 might be better, but the function's default is already 0. So the parameters would be distance=20, time=4. That should give the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, isn't needed here because we're not given initial and final speeds or time, but rather distance and time. So the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}
