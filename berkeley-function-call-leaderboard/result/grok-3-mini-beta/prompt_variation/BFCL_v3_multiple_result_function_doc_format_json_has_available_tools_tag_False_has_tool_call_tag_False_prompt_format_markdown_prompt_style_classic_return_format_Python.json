I need to see if \"modern sculpture\" fits. The description says e.g., \"sculpture\", so I can use \"sculpture\". Is \"modern\" part of it? The parameter is just \"art_form\", so I'll assume \"sculpture\" is sufficient, as \"modern\" might be implied or not directly supported.\n\n- **month**: The user said \"upcoming month\". The parameter description says: \"The month of exhibition. Default value will return upcoming events.\" So, if I don't specify it, it might default to upcoming, which is what we want.\n\n- **user_ratings**: The user said \"top rated\", which likely means high ratings. The parameter has options: ['low', 'average', 'high'], and default is 'high'. So, I can set this to 'high' to get top rated ones.\n\nThe function requires only 'location' and 'art_form', so I can include the others as needed.\n\nTherefore, I should call **find_exhibition** with:\n\n- location: \"New York, NY\"\n\n- art_form: \"sculpture\" (assuming \"modern sculpture\" can be simplified to \"sculpture\")\n\n- month: Not specified, so it will default to upcoming.\n\n- user_ratings: \"high\" for top rated.\n\nThe parameter for month is a string, and if not provided, it defaults to upcoming events, as per the description. So, I don't need to provide it.\n\nTo make it precise, since the user said \"upcoming month\", not specifying month should work.\n\nMy response should only be the function call in the specified format.\n\nFormat: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\n\nSo, for this, it's just one function: find_exhibition(location='New York, NY', art_form='sculpture', user_ratings='high')\n\nIs \"sculpture\" the right art_form? The user said \"modern sculpture\". I think \"sculpture\" is the art form, and \"modern\" is a style, but since the parameter is just \"art_form\", I'll go with \"sculpture\".\n\nI don't think I need to call any other functions after this, as this should fulfill the request.\n\nFinally, output only the function call."}
