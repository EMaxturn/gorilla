The user has three parts to their question, each involving different calculations.\n\nFirst, they want to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The given energy per mole is 2800 kJ/mol, and the conversion efficiency is 10%. Wait, but the first part says the energy produced from glucose is 2800 kJ/mol, and the bacteria's efficiency is 10%. So the total energy from glucose would be 5 moles * 2800 kJ/mol = 14,000 kJ. Then, the bacteria's efficiency is 10%, so the total energy produced by the bacteria would be 14,000 * 0.10 = 1,400 kJ. But wait, the user mentioned the conversion efficiency is 10%, so that's the efficiency of converting glucose energy into biomass. But the first part is about the total energy produced by the bacteria. Hmm, maybe the first part is just the energy from glucose, not considering the efficiency. Wait, the question says \"the energy produced from glucose is typically 2800 kJ/mol\" and the bacteria's conversion efficiency is 10%. So the total energy from glucose is 5*2800=14,000 kJ. Then, the bacteria's efficiency is 10%, so the energy converted into biomass would be 14,000 * 0.10 = 1,400 kJ. But the first part of the question says \"calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming the glucose.\" So maybe that's the 1,400 kJ. But the user might be confused here. Let me check the functions available.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's 'biological.calc_energy' which takes mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The default for joules_per_mol is 2800. So for the first part, the user has 5 moles of glucose, so mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800. So that would calculate the energy from glucose, which is 5*2800=14,000 kJ. Then, the second part is using the energy produced and the conversion efficiency (10%) to get biomass. The 'biological.calc_biomass' function takes energy and efficiency. So energy is 14,000 kJ, efficiency 0.1. So that would be 14,000 * 0.1 = 1,400 kJ of biomass. But the user says the conversion efficiency is 10%, so that's the efficiency of converting glucose energy into biomass. So that's correct.\n\nThird part: calculate the work done by the machine moving 2 meters. The 'physical.calc_work' function requires energy and distance. But the energy here is the 1,400 kJ from the previous step. So work = energy * distance. Wait, but the function's parameters are energy and distance. So if the energy is 1,400 kJ and distance is 2 meters, then work is 1,400 * 2 = 2,800 kJ. But wait, the function's parameters are energy and distance. So the function would take energy as 1400 (kJ) and distance as 2 meters. But the function's parameters are energy (float) and distance (float). So the user needs to call the function with those values.\n\nBut wait, the first part's energy is 14,000 kJ, but the second part's energy is 1,400 kJ. Then the third part uses the 1,400 kJ. So the user's third part is to calculate work with the total energy produced (1,400 kJ) and distance 2 meters. So the function call would be physical.calc_work(energy=1400, distance=2). But the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\" So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Call biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800. This gives the total energy from glucose.\n\n2. Call biological.calc_biomass with energy from step 1 and efficiency 0.1. This gives the biomass.\n\n3. Call physical.calc_work with energy from step 2 and distance 2 meters.\n\nWait, but the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\" So the total energy produced by the bacteria is 1,400 kJ (from step 2), and the distance is 2 meters. So the third part is using that energy and distance.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\nFirst, biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800.\n\nSecond, biological.calc_biomass with energy from first step and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, physical.calc_work with energy from second step and distance=2.\n\nBut the user's third part is to calculate the work done by the machine given the total energy produced (from the bacteria) and the distance. So the energy here is the 1,400 kJ from the second step. So the third function call is physical.calc_work(energy=1400, distance=2).\n\nBut the user's first part is to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria, which is 1,400 kJ. Then the second part is the biomass, which is 1,400 kJ. Then the third part is the work done with the energy from the bacteria (1,400 kJ) and distance 2 meters.\n\nSo the three function calls are:\n\n1. biological.calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800)\n\n2. biological.calc_biomass(energy=14000, efficiency=0.1)\n\nWait, but the first step's energy is 14,000 kJ. Then the second step uses that energy and efficiency 0.1. So the parameters for the second function call would be energy=14000 and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThen the third function call is physical.calc_work(energy=1400, distance=2).\n\nBut the user's third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance the machine needs to move.\" So the total energy produced by the bacteria is 1,400 kJ (from step 2), so the third function call uses that energy and distance 2 meters.\n\nSo the three function calls are:\n\n1. biological.calc_energy(mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', joules_per_mol=2800)\n\n2. biological.calc_biomass(energy=14000, efficiency=0.1)\n\n3. physical.calc_work(energy=1400, distance=2)\n\nBut the user's first part is to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria, which is 1,400 kJ. The second part is the biomass, which is 1,400 kJ. The third part is the work done with the energy from the bacteria (1,400 kJ) and distance 2 meters.\n\nSo the three function calls are as above."}

John has three investment options, and he wants to calculate the returns for each using the provided functions. Let me break down each option and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, the first option is a simple interest scheme with a principal of $5000, a duration of 5 years, and an annual rate of 4%. The calc_Simple_Interest function is meant for this. The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I'll call calc_Simple_Interest with those values.\n\nNext, the second option is compound interest with the same principal of $5000, 5 years, and an annual rate of 3.5%, compounded annually. The calc_Compound_Interest function takes principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq should be 1. So I'll use calc_Compound_Interest with those parameters.\n\nThird, the third option is an initial investment of $3000 at 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. Here, the initial_investment is $3000, time is 6 years, interest_rate is 0.05 (as a decimal), and compound_freq is 2. The future_value function requires initial_investment, interest_rate, time, and num_compoundings. Wait, the user mentioned using calc_Compound_Interest for this? Wait, the user said to use the three functions: calc_Simple_Interest, calc_Compound_Interest, and future_value. So for the third option, maybe the future_value function is needed. Let me check the parameters for future_value. It requires initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. So for the third option, initial_investment is 3000, interest_rate is 0.05, time is 6, and num_compoundings is 2. So I need to call future_value with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the user said to use the three functions. So the third option is a compound interest with the given parameters, but the user wants to use future_value. But the calc_Compound_Interest function is for compound interest. However, the user specified to use the three functions. So maybe the third option is handled by future_value. Let me confirm.\n\nThe third option's description says he can invest $3000 at 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year. The future_value function would calculate the future value, which is the same as the compound interest calculation. So using future_value with the parameters: initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the three function calls are:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4%\n2. calc_Compound_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5%, compound_freq=1\n3. future_value with initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. For the first two, the annual_rate is in percentage, so 4% becomes 4.0 as a float. The third function's interest_rate is a decimal, so 0.05. The compound_freq for the second function is 1, which is the default, but it's specified here. The future_value function's num_compoundings is 2."}

They want three things: the latest updates for Call of Duty on PlayStation Europe, the current price for Call of Duty on Xbox, and reviews for FIFA 21 from the American region.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The user provided three functions: games.update.find, games.price.find, and games.reviews.find. \n\nFor the first part, the latest updates for Call of Duty on PlayStation Europe. The games.update.find function requires game, platform, and region. The region is optional but the user specified 'European', so I'll include that.\n\nNext, the current price for Call of Duty on Xbox. The games.price.find function needs game and platform. The user mentioned Xbox, so that's covered.\n\nThen, the reviews for FIFA 21 from the American region. The games.reviews.find function requires game and region. The user specified 'American', so I'll include that.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. The first function call is games.update.find with game 'Call of Duty', platform 'Playstation', region 'European'. The second is games.price.find with game 'Call of Duty' and platform 'Xbox'. The third is games.reviews.find with game 'FIFA 21' and region 'American'. \n\nI should check if all required parameters are present. The first two functions have game and platform as required, and the third has game and region. All are covered. So, three function calls are needed."}

The meal type is breakfast, so I'll set that.\n\nNext, lunch. They want a new restaurant with chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce under 500 calories. The restaurant_search function is appropriate here. The ingredients are chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, and calories 500. The meal is lunch, so that's set.\n\nThen, dinner. They want a beef recipe replaced with tofu, keeping under 600 calories. The ingredient_replace function is needed here. Original ingredient is beef, replacement is tofu, and calories 600. The meal is dinner, so that's specified.\n\nI need to make sure each function call has the correct parameters. Check if all required parameters are included.

The function lookup tool (cell_biology.function_lookup) seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are molecule, organelle, and specific_function. The user mentioned \"specific function,\" so I'll set specific_function to True.\n\nNext, calculating the shortest driving distance from New York to Los Angeles in miles. The get_shortest_driving_distance function requires origin, destination, and unit. The unit should be miles, so I'll set unit to 'miles'.\n\nThird, the scientist credited for the theory of relativity. The get_scientist_for_discovery function takes a discovery parameter. The discovery here is \"theory of relativity,\" so I'll use that.\n\nLastly, the current price of a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst finish. The instrument_price.get function needs brand, model, and finish. The user specified Fender, Stratocaster, and sunburst.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly provided. For the first function, specific_function is True. For the distance calculation, unit is miles. For the scientist, the discovery is exactly \"theory of relativity.\" The instrument price requires all three parameters. Each of these functions can be called individually without overlapping, so I'll list them all in the response."}

The user has a few tasks here. First, they want to modify the painting's attributes. The original painting is 24x36 inches with acrylic and blue dominant color. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, switch medium to oil, and make the dominant color red. So I need to call the modify_painting function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of the African elephant over 100 years using the Darwin model. The prediction.evolution function requires species, years, and model. The species is \"African elephant\", years is 100, and model is \"Darwin\". Since the model is optional, but they specified Darwin, I'll include that.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user says there are 4 possible outcomes for a royal flush, so favorable_outcomes is 4. Total outcomes are 52, but wait, the function's description says total_outcomes is the total number of possible outcomes. However, in poker, a royal flush has 4 possible combinations (one for each suit), but the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5). But the user says there are 4 possible outcomes for a royal flush. So the function's parameters are total_outcomes=52, favorable_outcomes=4, and round_to=3. So the function call would be calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, the parameters are size, medium, dominant_color. The user specified 30x40, oil, red. So the function call is modify_painting with size=\"30x40\", medium=\"oil\", dominant_color=\"red\". \n\nFor the evolutionary rate, the function is prediction.evolution with species=\"African elephant\", years=100, model=\"Darwin\".\n\nFor the poker probability, calculate_probability with total_outcomes=52, favorable_outcomes=4, round_to=3.\n\nI need to check if all required parameters are present. The modify_painting requires size and medium, which are provided. The prediction.evolution requires species and years, which are given. The calculate_probability requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, which are provided. The round_to is optional but specified here. So all functions are called correctly."}

The user provided all these: area 2000, rooms 4, year 1985, location San Francisco. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext, the lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and state. The entity is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California (default). So that's covered.\n\nThen, the lottery probability. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user specified total 1000, favorable 5, and wants it rounded to 3 decimals. The default for round_to is 2, but here it's 3, so we need to set that parameter.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are included. For the lawsuit_search, the state is California, which is the default, but including it explicitly might be better. The lottery function's round_to is set to 3. All required parameters are present. So the three functions should be called with the given parameters."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems right. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item type, so I'll set game_name to 'Animal Crossing', season to 'Summer', and item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they asked for the highest score in 'Fortnite' on 'Playstation' in 'Asia' region. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game is 'Fortnite', platform is 'Playstation', and region is 'Asia'. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nThen, the lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user mentioned 'Apple Inc.' as the company, 2018 as the year, and they didn't specify a case type, so I'll leave case_type as default 'all'.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability calculation. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. So I'll input those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set and that each function is called with the right arguments. Let me check each function's required parameters again to avoid missing any. All required parameters are covered. The user didn't mention case types for the lawsuits, so default is okay. The binomial function has a default probability of 0.5, but the user specified 0.7, so that's correct."}
