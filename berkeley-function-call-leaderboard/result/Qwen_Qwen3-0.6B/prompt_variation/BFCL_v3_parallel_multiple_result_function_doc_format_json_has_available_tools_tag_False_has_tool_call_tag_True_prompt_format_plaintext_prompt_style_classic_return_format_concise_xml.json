Similarly, for Nepal and Malaysia, the get_projection function would be used with species 'tiger' and years 10.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"last 5 years\" and \"next 10 years\". So for Bangladesh and India, each call would be for 5 years. For Nepal and Malaysia, each call would be for 10 years. That makes sense.

There are two functions: get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nLooking at get_sculpture_details, it requires a museum location and a sculpture ID. The user provided the locations but didn't mention the IDs. The other function, get_artwork_price, requires the museum location, sculpture material, and dimensions (as an array of integers). \n\nThe user mentioned two sculptures. For the first one, the material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. The second is bronze, size 6x3 ft. But the problem is that the get_sculpture_details function needs the sculpture ID, which isn't provided. The get_artwork_price function can take the material and size, but the dimensions are an array. \n\nWait, the user didn't specify the IDs for the sculptures.

The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user provided the locations and materials, but the sizes are 4x4 and 6x3. So maybe I can use get_artwork_price for each. \n\nWait, the sculpture_size is an array of integers. So for the first sculpture, the size is [4,4], and for the second [6,3]. So I can call get_artwork_price with those parameters. But the problem is that the get_sculpture_details function requires the sculpture ID, which isn't provided. \n\nSo the steps would be: call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, using their respective materials and sizes. But since the user hasn't provided the IDs, maybe the answer is that the functions can't be used without the IDs. \n\nBut the user's question is to find the average price.

The first function is get_monarchs, which requires country and century. The user mentioned France and 17th century, so that's covered. The second function, get_events, is for historical events, but the user is asking about wars in England during the 18th century. Wait, the get_events function's description says it provides events based on country and century. But the user is specifically asking for major wars in England during the 18th century. However, the get_events function's parameters don't mention wars. The event_type parameter is optional, but the default is 'war'. So maybe I can use get_events with England and 18th century, but the user is asking for specific wars. But the function's description says it provides events, so perhaps it includes wars. But I need to confirm. The third function is get_culture, which provides cultural trends, art movements, etc. The user is asking about art movements in Italy during the 19th century.

The get_culture function's parameters are country, century, and aspect. The aspect is optional. So if I don't include it, it defaults to 'art'. But the user's question is about art movements, so including aspect might be better. However, since the aspect is optional, maybe it's safe to omit. But perhaps the function expects it. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the aspect is not required, so just call get_culture with country Italy, century 19. But the user's question is about art movements, so including aspect could help. But since the function allows for optional parameters, perhaps it's better to include aspect as 'art' to specify. But the user's question is about art movements, so maybe the aspect is 'art'. However, the function's parameters don't require it, so maybe it's optional. But to be precise, perhaps include it. But the user's question is about art movements, so maybe the aspect is 'art'.

The user wants to compare two values: one from the player's all-time goals and another from the top scorer.

The user has two main tasks here. First, modifying the painting's attributes, then predicting the evolutionary rate of an African elephant, and finally calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker. \n\nStarting with the painting modification. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant. The user wants to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, and red dominant. So I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size is 30x40, medium is oil, and dominant color is red. The previous parameters were blue, so I'll replace that.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The prediction.evolution function needs species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, model is Darwin. The default model is Darwin, so if not specified, it's already set, but I should include it to be safe.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The probability of a royal flush in a 52-card deck with 4 possible outcomes. The calculate_probability function requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. Total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4. The result should be rounded to 3 decimal places. So I need to call calculate_probability with those values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For the painting, the size is a string, medium is a string, dominant_color is a string. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years is an integer, model is a string. For the probability, total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes are integers. All parameters are correctly specified. No missing parameters here. So I'll list each function call accordingly."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, and built in 1985. The function predict_house_price requires area, rooms, year, and location. All these parameters are provided, so I can use that function.\n\nNext, they need information about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. The default state is California, so even if not specified, it's okay. So I'll call lawsuit_search with those parameters.\n\nThen, the probability part: total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user specified all these, so I'll use that function.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly with the right parameters. Let me check again: yes, all required parameters are present. No missing parameters. So the three function calls should cover all parts of the user's request."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: get_collectables_in_season. The game is 'Animal Crossing', season is 'Summer', and item_type should be 'fish'. So I need to call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The function game_score.highest requires game, platform, and region. So game is 'Fortnite', platform 'PlayStation', region 'Asia'. That's the second function call.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user didn't specify case_type, so default is all. So call that with company 'Apple Inc.', year 2018.\n\nLastly, binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. So use those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the parameters. Let me check each one again to ensure no missing parameters. All required parameters are included. So the final answer should have all four function calls in the specified format."}
