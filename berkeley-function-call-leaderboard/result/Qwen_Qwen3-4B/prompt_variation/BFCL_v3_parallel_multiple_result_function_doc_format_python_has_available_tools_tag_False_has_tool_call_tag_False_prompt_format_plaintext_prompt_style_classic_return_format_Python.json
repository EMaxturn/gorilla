The get_projection function's years parameter is the number of years into the future. So that's correct.\n\nCheck if all parameters are provided.

The file path is dataset.csv, and the delimiter is probably commas since it's a standard CSV. So I'll call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv' and delimiter=','.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y as lists. The user specified x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so after loading the data, I need to extract those columns. But since the functions are separate, I have to assume that after loading, the data is in a structure where 'sales' and 'future_sales' are available as keys. So I'll pass those as lists to the linear_regression_fit function. Also, the user wants residuals, so I need to set return_residuals=True.\n\nSo the steps are: load data, then fit the model with the specified variables and return residuals.

The available functions are get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nThe get_sculpture_details function requires the museum location and sculpture ID. But the user hasn't provided sculpture IDs, only the dimensions and materials. So maybe that function isn't directly useful here unless we first get the details to find the ID. But the user is asking for price, which is handled by get_artwork_price. \n\nLooking at get_artwork_price, it needs museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user provided both materials (marble and bronze) and dimensions for each sculpture, along with the museum locations. So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price with the respective parameters.\n\nWait, but the function's args are museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. The user has provided all these for both sculptures. So I can call the function twice: once for Philadelphia's marble statue and once for New York's bronze sculpture. \n\nBut the user is asking for the average price. So I need to get the price of each sculpture and then average them. However, the functions might return individual prices. So the plan is to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, collect the prices, then compute the average.\n\nBut the problem is that the function get_artwork_price might not take the sculpture ID, but rather the material and size. Since the user hasn't provided IDs, but the question is about the price based on size and material, which are given, the function can be called directly with the provided parameters.\n\nSo first, for the marble statue in Philadelphia: museum_location is \"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material is \"marble\", sculpture_size is [4,4]. Then for the bronze in New York: museum_location is \"New York\", sculpture_material is \"bronze\", sculpture_size is [6,3]. \n\nTherefore, two function calls are needed. The user's question requires both prices to calculate the average. So the answer will involve calling get_artwork_price twice with those parameters."}

The user has three parts to their question. \n\nFirst, they want to calculate the total energy from 5 moles of glucose. The function biological.calc_energy seems right here. The parameters are mols=5 and substance is \"C6H12O6\". The default joules_per_mol is 2800, which matches the given value, so maybe I don't need to specify that unless it's different. But the problem states the energy produced from glucose is 2800 kJ/mol, so I should include that. Wait, the function's default is already 2800, but since the user specifies it, maybe it's better to include it to be explicit. So call calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800.0.\n\nSecond, calculate biomass using the energy from the first step and efficiency of 10%. The function biological.calc_biomass takes energy and efficiency. So after getting the energy from the first step, pass that energy and efficiency=0.1 to calc_biomass.\n\nThird, calculate work done by the machine. The function physical.calc_work needs energy and distance. The energy here is the total energy from the glucose, which is the same as the first step's result. The distance is 2 meters. So use the energy from the first step and distance=2.0 in calc_work.\n\nWait, but the third part says \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria\". Wait, the total energy produced by the bacteria is the same as the energy calculated in the first step. So yes, use that value. So the work is calculated using that energy and distance 2 meters.\n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_energy(mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", joules_per_mol=2800.0)\n2. calc_biomass(energy=energy_from_step1, efficiency=0.1)\n3. calc_work(energy=energy_from_step1, distance=2.0)\n\nBut since the functions are called in sequence, the output of the first is needed for the second, and the first's output is needed for the third. So in the response, I need to chain these calls. However, the user's instruction says to return the function calls in the format. So the assistant should make each call in order, using the results from previous steps. But since the assistant can't store intermediate results, perhaps each function call is made in sequence, with the parameters passed as needed. So the first call is to calc_energy, then the second uses the energy from that, then the third uses the same energy. So the answer would be three function calls in order."}

So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest. Principal is $5000, duration 5 years, annual rate 3.5%, compounded annually. The calc_Compound_Interest function requires principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1.

Wait, the future_value function's interest_rate is a decimal. The third option's annual rate is 5%, so that's 0.05. The num_compoundings is 2. But wait, the function's time is in years? Wait, the function's description says time is the number of time periods. Wait, the function's parameters: time is an integer, num_compoundings is the number of times interest is compounded per time period. So if the time is 6 years, and compounded twice a year, then num_compoundings is 2. But the function's time is in years? Or is time the number of periods? Wait, the function's description says \"time (int): The number of time periods the money is invested for.\" So if it's compounded twice a year, then each year is a time period, but compounded twice. Wait, maybe the time is in years, and num_compoundings is the number of times per year. Wait, the function's parameters for future_value: initial_investment, interest_rate (as decimal), time (int), num_compoundings (default 1). So for the third option, the initial investment is $3000, interest rate is 5% (so 0.05), time is 6 years, and num_compoundings is 2. So the function call would be future_value with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the third option's description says \"annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year.\" So the time is 6 years, and compounded twice a year.

Wait, the description says for the 1700s, input '18'. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the century is an integer. So the 17th century is 17, but the example given is 18 for the 1700s. Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, the 1700s is the 18th century. So maybe the function expects the century as the number of the century. So 17th century is 17, 18th is 18, etc. So for France's 17th century, the century parameter is 17. So the first function call would be get_monarchs(country='France', century=17).\n\nNext, major wars in England during the 18th century.

So that's another function call.\n\nThen, the user wants the probability of winning a lottery with 1000 total outcomes and 5 favorable, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. So that's the third function call.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly provided. No missing parameters here. Each function is applicable to part of the query. So three function calls in total."}

They have four separate requests here, so I need to handle each one individually.\n\nFirst, they want to know the types of fish collectable in 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems appropriate here. The parameters required are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item_type, so I'll set that.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in 'Fortnite' on PlayStation in the Asia region. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. The user provided all three, so that's straightforward.\n\nThen, they need details on lawsuits against Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name and year. The case_type is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I'll leave it out.\n\nLastly, a binomial probability calculation with 10 trials, 3 successes, and a 0.7 success probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function takes number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided all these values.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. Let me check each function again to confirm. All required parameters are present, so I can proceed to call each function in order."}
