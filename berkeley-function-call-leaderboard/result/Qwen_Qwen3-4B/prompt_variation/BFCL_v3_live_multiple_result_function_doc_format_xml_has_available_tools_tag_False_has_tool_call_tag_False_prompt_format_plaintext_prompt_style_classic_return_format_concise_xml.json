The available functions don't include a direct way to look up personal information like birthdays from an external source. The functions provided are for sending messages, pausing heartbeats, interacting with ChatGPT, and managing memory.\n\nSince the user is asking for a specific piece of information (birthday), and none of the functions allow querying external databases or calendars, I might not have the capability to retrieve that data. However, maybe the user expects me to use the core_memory or archival_memory functions. But the core memory is initialized with the persona and user details, and the user hasn't provided any information about Shishir Patil in the initial context. The archival memory is for structured data, but again, without prior entries, I can't retrieve it.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to use the recall_memory_search function to search through conversation history. But the user hasn't mentioned Shishir Patil before, so there's no prior conversation to search. The functions available don't include a way to look up public information or external data sources. Therefore, I can't find Shishir Patil's birthday using the provided functions.\n\nNext, even if I could find the birthday, the user wants a congratulatory message. The send_message function can be used to send a message, but without knowing the birthday, I can't create a personalized message. The user might be testing if I can handle such a request, but given the functions available, I can't retrieve the birthday data. Therefore, I need to inform the user that I can't retrieve the birthday and can't send the message without that information. However, the user might have intended for me to use the core_memory or another function, but based on the given functions, it's not possible. So the correct response is to point out that the necessary parameters are missing and that I can't retrieve the birthday."}

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the period October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is given, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and maybe the individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dict. The BankStatementOverView function might require that, but the user hasn't given individual transactions. However, the user did mention the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. Maybe the transaction_overview can be constructed with those totals. But the function's description says it's a summary of transactions within the period, including totals and counts. So perhaps the transaction_overview is a dictionary that includes those totals.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to create that summary. However, the user is asking for the BankStatementOverView, which requires the transaction_overview. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate can be used to generate the transaction summary, which can then be passed to BankStatementOverView.\n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview that includes a summary of transactions. So perhaps the BankStatementOverView function is the right one, but the transaction_overview parameter needs to be filled. Since the user provided the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, maybe the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with those values. However, the function's parameters for transaction_overview are a dict, but the user hasn't provided individual transactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can be used to generate the transaction summary, which would then be used as the transaction_overview for BankStatementOverView. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe that's not possible. \n\nWait, the user's question includes the total deposits and withdrawals, starting and ending balances. The BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict that includes totals and counts. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be constructed with the totals provided by the user. However, the function's parameters for transaction_overview are a dict, but the user hasn't provided individual transactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to generate the summary, but the user hasn't provided the individual transactions. The user only provided totals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate can't be used here because it requires an array of transactions. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. The user is asking for an overview that includes a summary of transactions. The BankStatementOverView function requires the transaction_overview as a dict. Since the user provided the total deposits, withdrawals, starting and ending balances, maybe the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with those values. But the function's parameters for transaction_overview are a dict, so perhaps that's acceptable. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters: bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview as a dict containing the totals and balances.\n\nBut the transaction_overview is a dict that should include the transaction summary. The user provided the starting balance, ending balance, total deposits, and total withdrawals. So the transaction_overview could be a dictionary with keys like 'total_deposits', 'total_withdrawals', 'starting_balance', 'ending_balance', and maybe the number of transactions. However, the user hasn't provided the number of transactions, so maybe that's not included. \n\nAlternatively, the transaction_overview might be generated by another function. But since the user hasn't provided individual transactions, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function can't be used here. \n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview that includes a summary of transactions. The BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict that includes the summary. So perhaps the user's provided data can be used to construct that dict. \n\nSo, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\n\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\n\naccount_type: \"checking\"\n\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\n\ntransaction_overview: {\n    \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n    \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n    \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n    \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut the function's transaction_overview is a dict, so that's acceptable. However, the user might also need the individual transactions, but since they aren't provided, maybe the transaction_summary.generate isn't needed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the transaction_summary.generate to be called to generate the summary, but without individual transactions, that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters and the transaction_overview as a dict with the totals and balances provided by the user."}

Therefore, the function call should be get_tech_stack with employee_id=\"Adriel\". The other parameters can be omitted as they are optional. \n\nI need to make sure that the function is called correctly. The parameters should be in the format specified. The employee_id is a string, so it's \"Adriel\". The other parameters are optional, so they can be excluded. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\"."}

But the user's question is to find restaurants in New York with intermediate price and outdoor seating. Maybe the category is not specified, so I need to proceed with a general category. Alternatively, maybe the function allows an empty string, but the parameters say it's required. This is a bit of a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the category is optional, but the function says it's required. So perhaps the user's query is missing the category.

Therefore, I'll proceed with 'American' as a possible category, even though the user didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to leave it as a general search, but the function requires a category. This is a problem. However, given the constraints, I'll proceed with the available information. The user didn't specify the category, so maybe the function allows a default, but since it's required, I have to include a value. Therefore, I'll use 'American' as the category.

Since the user is asking about show times for a specific movie at a theater, the relevant function here is Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie. \n\nLooking at the parameters for Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie: it requires movie_name, location, show_date, and optionally theater_name and show_type. The user mentioned \"Imax film\" and the theater name \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\" in Danville. \n\nWait, the function needs the movie name. But the user hasn't specified a particular movie yet.

But the function Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie is for getting show times for a specific movie. So perhaps the user needs to first find the movies available (using Movies_1_FindMovies) and then get the times.

So maybe using that function first to find movies at Century Blackhawk Plaza in Danville with show_type as Imax. \n\nBut the user is asking for what's on, which could be the list of movies.

Then, once the movies are found, the user can get the times for each. But the user's question is to tell them what's on, so maybe the answer is the list of movies. \n\nBut the functions available don't have a function that directly lists all movies at a theater. The Movies_1_FindMovies function can search for movies based on location, theater, genre, and show type. So perhaps the correct approach is to call Movies_1_FindMovies with the location as \"Danville, CA\", theater_name as \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", and show_type as \"Imax\". That would return the list of movies showing at that theater in Imax. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is asking for show times of Imax films, but without a specific movie name, maybe the function can't be used. However, the user might not know the movie title, so the first step is to find the movies available. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call here is Movies_1_FindMovies with the parameters location=\"Danville, CA\", theater_name=\"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", and show_type=\"Imax\". That would retrieve the list of movies showing at that theater in Imax format. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking \"what's on\", which is the current schedule.

The parameters required are location, which is \"Danville, CA\", theater_name, and show_type. The user didn't specify a genre, so that's optional. \n\nSo the function call should be Movies_1_FindMovies with location=\"Danville, CA\", theater_name=\"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type=\"Imax\"."}

The user provided the origin as Atlanta, GA and destination as Boston, MA. The departure date is March 12, 2023.

The amount is $154, but the function expects the amount in USD. Since it's already in USD, I can input 154.00. The receiver is the landlord's email, so that's the receiver parameter.\n\nThe user also specified \"private\" payment. The function has a private_visibility parameter which is a boolean. So I need to set that to true.\n\nWait, the function's amount for MakePayment is in USD, but the user wrote $154. The function's description says \"specified in USD\", so entering 154.00 as a float makes sense. But maybe the function expects it as a float, so 154.00 is correct.\n\nPutting it all together: payment_method is \"debit card\", amount is 154.00, receiver is the landlord's email (assuming the user provides that, but the question says \"my landlord's email\", so maybe the user expects the system to know it, but since it's not provided, perhaps the user expects the function to be called with the email as a parameter. Wait, the user's question says \"to my landlord's email\", so the receiver is the email address. But the user hasn't provided the actual email. Hmm, but the function requires the receiver as a string. Since the user hasn't given the email, maybe the function call can't be made without that info. Wait, but the user is asking to initiate the payment, so maybe the email is known. But in the problem, the user hasn't provided the email address. Wait, the user's question is \"Could you initiate a private payment from my debit card to my landlord's email for $154?\" So the receiver is the landlord's email, but the actual email address isn't provided. However, the function requires the receiver as a string. So maybe the user expects that the email is known, but in the function call, we need to have the actual value. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the function can't be called. Wait, but the user is asking to perform the action, so maybe the email is a placeholder. But according to the problem, the user hasn't provided the email, so the function call would need that parameter. However, the user hasn't given it. Wait, but maybe the user is assuming that the system knows the email. But in reality, the function requires the receiver as a parameter. So perhaps the user's question is missing the email address. But the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the function call can't be made because the receiver parameter is required. But the user is asking to do it, so maybe the email is known. Wait, but in the problem, the user hasn't provided the email. Therefore, the function call can't be made. But the user is asking to initiate the payment, so maybe the email is a parameter that the user expects to be filled in. However, the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the function call is missing the receiver parameter. But the user's question says \"to my landlord's email\", so maybe the system is supposed to use that as the receiver. But without the actual email, the function can't be called. Therefore, the answer would be that the receiver parameter is missing. But the user hasn't provided the email. However, the user might be expecting that the email is known. But according to the problem, the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the function call can't be made. But the user is asking to do it, so maybe the email is a parameter that the user is supposed to provide. But in the question, the user hasn't given it.

Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe Events_3_FindEvents function seems relevant here. It retrieves cultural events in a specified city on a given date. The parameters needed are event_type, city, and date. The user mentioned \"music concert or a play,\" so event_type could be \"concert\" or \"play.\" The city is New York, and the date is March 10th. The date format should be YYYY-MM-DD, so 2023-03-10. \n\nWait, the user didn't specify the exact event type, just that it's a music concert or play. So maybe I should call the function with event_type as \"concert\" and \"play\" separately? But the function's event_type is a single string. Hmm, maybe the function can handle either, so I can set event_type to \"concert\" and \"play\" in separate calls? Or perhaps the function allows a list? But looking at the parameters, event_type is a string, not an array. So maybe I need to make two separate calls for each event type. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a general category like \"music\" or \"theater.\" But the user specified \"music concert or a play,\" which are both under cultural events. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate entries. But since the function's event_type is a single string, perhaps the user needs to make two separate function calls. However, the user might not know that. But according to the function definition, event_type is a single string. So maybe the best approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as \"concert\" and then again with \"play,\" both in New York on March 10th. But the user might not want to do that. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if they are combined. But the parameters don't allow for multiple values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"music\" or \"theater,\" which could encompass concerts and plays. But the user specifically mentioned concert or play. So perhaps the function is designed to take one type at a time. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the function twice: once for \"concert\" and once for \"play,\" both in New York on March 10th. However, the user might not know that. But according to the function's parameters, event_type is a single string. So the assistant should make two separate function calls. \n\nBut the user's question is to find events that are either a music concert or a play. So the assistant should check both types. Therefore, the correct function calls would be to invoke Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as \"concert\" and then again with \"play,\" both with city as \"New York, NY\" and date as \"2023-03-10\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the given function definition, event_type is a string. Therefore, the assistant needs to make two separate calls. However, the user might not have specified the exact event type, so maybe the assistant should first check for concerts and then plays. \n\nSo the answer would be two function calls: one for event_type \"concert\" and another for \"play\"."}

Then, if there are results, use PlayMedia with the track from that album.\n\nBut the functions need to be called in sequence.

However, the user might not have provided all the parameters. Wait, the user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\", so maybe the LookupMusic should include that album parameter. So the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\", album=\"Gotta Be Me\". Then, if that returns tracks, the next step is to play them.

But since the assistant can't know the track name, maybe the assistant should call PlayMedia with the album parameter, assuming that the system can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play the album, but the PlayMedia function requires a track name. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play a song from the album \"Gotta Be Me\" that is Hillbilly style from 2019.

So the assistant should first call LookupMusic with the given parameters, then, once that's done, call PlayMedia with the track from the result. But since the assistant can't process the response, maybe the assistant should make the first call and then the next call based on the result. However, the user's question is to make the function calls, so the assistant should make the first call, and then the next call if needed. But the user's message is a single turn, so the assistant should make the necessary function calls in that turn.\n\nWait, the user's message is: \"I want to hear a song. I'm in the mood for Hillbilly style from 2019. I had heard that the album Gotta Be Me is really good.\" So the user wants to play a song that is Hillbilly style from 2019, and the album \"Gotta Be Me\" is good.

Therefore, the assistant should first call LookupMusic, and then, in the next turn, call PlayMedia with the track name. But the user's question is to make the function calls in this turn. Therefore, the assistant should make the first call to LookupMusic, and then, if possible, the next call to PlayMedia. But the user hasn't provided the track name, so the assistant can't call PlayMedia without it. Therefore, the assistant should first call LookupMusic to find the track, then in the next turn, call PlayMedia with the track name.

Therefore, the assistant should call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\", album=\"Gotta Be Me\". Then, if that returns a track, the assistant would call PlayMedia with that track. But since the assistant can't know the track name, maybe the assistant can't make the PlayMedia call yet. Therefore, the assistant should only make the LookupMusic call in this turn. However, the user's intention is to play a song, so maybe the assistant should call PlayMedia with the album parameter, but that's not sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can call PlayMedia with the album and genre, but the PlayMedia function requires a track.

But since the assistant can't process the response, the assistant should make the first call. Therefore, the answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters."}

Let me look at the available functions to see which one can help.\n\nFirst, there's the get_websites function. It says it retrieves a list of all configured websites with their settings and metadata. The parameters include a status_filter, which can be set to \"active\". That seems exactly what the user needs. The user wants actively configured websites, so setting status_filter to \"active\" makes sense. Also, there's an include_metadata parameter, but the user didn't specify needing metadata, so maybe we can leave that as default (probably false unless specified). \n\nAnother function is website_configuration_api.WebsiteConfigurationApi.get_website, but that requires a websiteId, which the user didn't provide. Since the user wants all active websites, not a specific one, this function isn't suitable here. \n\nThe third function, ApplicationSettingsApi.get_service_configs, is about service configurations, which doesn't relate to websites. So we can ignore that.\n\nSo the correct function to use is get_websites with status_filter set to \"active\". The parameters required are status_filter, which is a string, and include_metadata, which is optional. Since the user didn't mention metadata, maybe we don't need to include it. But the function's parameters have include_metadata as optional, so maybe it's better to include it as false. Wait, but the default might already be false. The function's required fields are status_filter (optional) and include_metadata (optional). Wait, no: looking back, the get_websites function's parameters have status_filter as required=false, so it's optional. So the user can specify status_filter as \"active\" and include_metadata as false. But since the user didn't ask for metadata, maybe it's better to not include it. However, the function's description says that include_metadata is whether to include metadata like creation date. If the user just wants the list of websites, maybe metadata isn't needed. But the function's parameters don't require it, so we can omit it. Wait, but the parameters are required=false, so it's optional. So the function call would be get_websites with status_filter=\"active\". The include_metadata can be omitted, as it's optional.

Looking at the functions provided, there's the add_service_config function. Its parameters are service_name (string, required) and configurations (dict, required). \n\nThe service_name is clearly 'fdsa'. The configurations need to be a dictionary. The user specified several keys: timeout, retry_count, endpoint_url, and requires_authentication. The values are 30 (integer), 5 (integer), the URL as a string, and true or false for authentication. \n\nWait, the parameters for the configurations should be a dict. So I need to structure that. The timeout is 30 seconds, so maybe the key is 'timeout' with value 30. Retry count is 5, so 'retry_count':5. Endpoint URL is 'https://api.fdsa-service.com' as a string. Requires authentication is a boolean, so 'requires_authentication': true. \n\nSo the configurations dictionary would be {'timeout': 30, 'retry_count':5, 'endpoint_url': 'https://api.fdsa-service.com', 'requires_authentication': True}. \n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly typed. The service_name is a string, and configurations is a dict. The add_service_config function is the right one here. The other functions like get_service_configs or order_service_config don't apply here because the user is adding a new config, not retrieving or ordering. \n\nSo the correct function call is add_service_config with service_name 'fdsa' and the configurations dict as above.

But the user didn't specify, so maybe just call the function without include_expired. Wait, but the default might be to exclude expired. However, the user might not know if any are expired. Alternatively, maybe the function without include_expired would return active ones, but the user might need all. Hmm, but the user didn't specify, so perhaps just call the function without that parameter. Wait, the function's parameters: include_expired is required as false, so it's optional. So the function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and no include_expired. But maybe the user wants all tokens, including expired. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the function will return all by default? Wait, the description says \"include_expired\" is a flag to determine if expired tokens should be included. So if the user doesn't set it, the default is probably not to include them. But the user might need all tokens, so maybe set include_expired to true. But the user didn't mention that. However, the user is asking to \"remind\" them of all tokens, so maybe they want all, including expired. But since the parameter is optional, maybe the function can be called with include_expired=True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the assistant should assume that. Alternatively, maybe the function without include_expired would return only active tokens, but the user might need all. But the user's question is a bit ambiguous. However, the correct approach is to call the function with the user_id and possibly include_expired. Since the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, it's safer to include expired ones. So the function call would be get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=True. But wait, the function's parameters: include_expired is a boolean, required=False.

The functions available are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application\", the create_global_application_alert_config is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that function: name (string, required), alert_type (string, required), threshold (float, required), recipients (array, required), and enabled (boolean, optional). \n\nThe user provided the name, threshold as 5%, which is a float (0.05?), and recipients as two emails. The alert_type isn't specified, but the description says the threshold units depend on the alert_type. Since it's an error rate, maybe the alert_type should be 'error_rate'. But the user didn't mention it. Wait, the question says \"error rate threshold of 5%\", so maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' and threshold is 5.0 (as a float). But the function requires alert_type. The user didn't specify it, but maybe it's implied. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is 'error' or 'error_rate'. Hmm. The user might have to specify that, but since they didn't, perhaps the function expects it. Wait, the function requires alert_type as a parameter. So the user's question must include that.

So the parameters would be name: 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type: 'error_rate', threshold: 0.05, recipients: ['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], and enabled is optional.

Wait, the function's description says it retrieves shareable API tokens. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Hmm, maybe that's not the right function.\n\nLooking at the other function: api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. This one also retrieves API tokens for the user. The parameters are include_expired (boolean), page (integer), and page_size (integer). The user wants all tokens, so maybe we need to fetch all pages. But the user didn't specify page or page_size. The default page is 1, and page_size is probably 100. But since the user says \"all,\" maybe we need to handle pagination. However, the user might not know about pagination, so perhaps the system should retrieve all tokens in one call if possible. But the function's parameters don't have a way to get all tokens at once. So maybe the user needs to be informed that they have to handle pagination, but since the user is asking for all, maybe the function can be called with page=1 and page_size=100, and then subsequent pages if needed. However, the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the get_api_tokens function can be called without specifying page and page_size, which would default to a certain number. But the function's parameters are optional. \n\nWait, the user's user ID is 12345. But the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id parameter. It's possible that the user is authenticated, so the function can retrieve tokens for the current user. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the function requires it. Wait, looking at the function definitions again: the get_api_tokens function's parameters are include_expired, page, and page_size. There's no user_id parameter. So maybe the user is already authenticated, and the function is retrieving tokens for their account. But the user provided their user ID, which might be necessary. However, the functions listed don't have a user_id parameter in get_api_tokens. So perhaps the user's user ID is not needed here, and the function is designed to retrieve tokens for the current user. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function, which does require a user_id. But the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. So maybe the correct function is get_api_tokens, but the user's user ID is not a parameter for that function. Therefore, perhaps the user's user ID is not needed here, and the function can be called without it. But that seems odd. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"My user ID is 12345\". So maybe the user is expecting that the function requires the user_id. But looking at the functions, the get_api_tokens function doesn't take a user_id. The get_shareable_api_tokens function does take a user_id. So perhaps the user is confused between the two functions. \n\nThe user is asking for all API tokens. The get_shareable_api_tokens might only return shareable tokens, while get_api_tokens might return all tokens. But the user's user ID is 12345. So maybe the correct function is get_api_tokens, but the user's user ID is not a parameter for that function. Therefore, perhaps the user is not authenticated, and the function requires the user_id. But the functions don't have that parameter. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the functions. \n\nThe get_shareable_api_tokens function requires user_id. The get_api_tokens function does not. So if the user is asking for all API tokens, maybe the get_api_tokens is the right one. But the user provided their user ID, which is not a parameter for that function. Therefore, maybe the user is using the wrong function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is authenticated, and the user_id is not needed. But the user provided it, so maybe the system should use the get_shareable_api_tokens function with the user_id. But that function is for shareable tokens, not all tokens. \n\nHmm. The user is asking for all API tokens. The get_api_tokens function is the one that retrieves API tokens, but the user_id is not a parameter. So perhaps the user is authenticated, and the function can be called without the user_id. But the user provided it, so maybe the system should use the get_shareable_api_tokens function with the user_id. But that's for shareable tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the wrong function. The user might be confused between the two functions. \n\nIn this case, the user is asking for all API tokens. The get_api_tokens function is the correct one, but the user_id is not a parameter. Therefore, the function can be called without the user_id. But the user provided it, so maybe the system should use the get_shareable_api_tokens function with the user_id. However, that function is for shareable tokens. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The user's message is a bit ambiguous. But given the functions available, the get_api_tokens function is the one that retrieves API tokens, and the user_id is not a parameter. Therefore, the correct function to call is get_api_tokens. However, the user provided their user ID, which is not a parameter for that function. So maybe the user is authenticated, and the function can be called without the user_id. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the get_shareable_api_tokens function, which requires the user_id. But that function is for shareable tokens. \n\nThe user says \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So the user is probably expecting to get all their API tokens, which would be retrieved via the get_api_tokens function. But since the user_id is not a parameter for that function, maybe the system can proceed to call get_api_tokens without the user_id. However, the user provided it, so maybe the system should use the get_shareable_api_tokens function. \n\nBut the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Therefore, the correct function is get_api_tokens. But the user_id is not a parameter for that function. Therefore, the system should call get_api_tokens with the default parameters. \n\nBut the user provided their user ID, which is 12345. However, the function doesn't take that parameter. Therefore, maybe the user is not authenticated, and the system should use the get_shareable_api_tokens function with the user_id. But that function is for shareable tokens. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The user is asking for all API tokens, but the available functions don't have a way to retrieve all tokens for a specific user_id. The get_shareable_api_tokens function requires user_id and includes revoked tokens. The get_api_tokens function doesn't take user_id. \n\nWait, maybe the user is using the get_api_tokens function, and the user_id is not needed because the function is authenticated. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the system should use that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the get_shareable_api_tokens function, which requires the user_id. But that function is for shareable tokens. \n\nIn this case, the user is asking for all API tokens, so the correct function is get_api_tokens. However, the user_id is not a parameter for that function. Therefore, the system should call get_api_tokens with the default parameters. \n\nBut the user provided their user ID, which is 12345. However, the function doesn't take that parameter. Therefore, the system should proceed to call get_api_tokens. \n\nSo the function call would be to api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with parameters include_expired=True (to get all tokens, including expired ones?), but the user didn't specify. The user wants all tokens, so maybe include_expired is True. But the default is probably False. \n\nAlternatively, the user might not know about the include_expired parameter. So the function call would be to get_api_tokens without any parameters, which would return the default page and page_size. \n\nBut the user is asking for all tokens, so maybe the system should call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True, and then handle pagination. However, the user might not know about that. \n\nBut according to the function's parameters, include_expired is a boolean. The user wants all tokens, so including expired ones. Therefore, the function call would be to get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. \n\nBut the user's user ID is 12345, but the function doesn't take that. Therefore, the system should proceed to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. \n\nSo the correct function call is api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the get_shareable_api_tokens function with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. But that function is for shareable tokens. \n\nBut the user is asking for all API tokens, not just shareable ones. Therefore, the correct function is get_api_tokens. \n\nSo the final answer is to call get_api_tokens with include_expired=True. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the default is to not include expired. However, the user wants all tokens, so including expired. \n\nTherefore, the function call is:\n\n<function name=\"api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens\">\n  <param name=\"include_expired\" type=\"boolean\">true</param>\n</function>"}

So the time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. \n\nThe purpose parameter is optional, but the user mentioned it's for a meeting, so adding 'meeting' as the purpose makes sense. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The alarm_time is a string in the correct format, and the purpose is a string. \n\nNo need for set_countdown here because the user isn't asking for a timer, just a reminder at a specific time. \n\nSo the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time set to '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'meeting'."}
