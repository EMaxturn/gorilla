I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. The first one requires loc, type, and time. The second one has loc, type, and time with a default for time. \n\nThe user provided the location as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits the format required for both functions. The type is 'Plus', and the time is 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the second function's time has a default of 10, but the user specified 10, so maybe either function can work. But the first function's description says the time is the maximum wait time. The user's request matches the parameters for both. However, the first function's loc is a full address, which the user provided. The second function's loc is city and state, but the user's address includes the street. But the second function's loc parameter example is 'Berkeley, CA', so maybe the first function is more appropriate here because the user provided a full address. \n\nSo, using uber.ride with loc as the full address, type as 'Plus', and time as 10. That should be correct. The second function might not take the full address, but the first one does. So the correct function to call is uber.ride with the given parameters."}

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The functions available include recalling memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user hasn't provided any prior information about Shishir Patil, I should check the core memory first. The core memory has the 'human' section which stores user details. But wait, the user hasn't given any details about Shishir Patil yet. Maybe the user is referring to themselves? Or perhaps there's a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the recall memory search function to look up any previous conversations. But since this is the first interaction, there's no prior conversation. The core memory's 'human' section might not have Shishir Patil's info. So, I need to check if there's any data in the archival memory. But the user hasn't provided any data there either. \n\nWait, the user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday. Since there's no information available in the core or archival memory, I can't retrieve the birthday. The functions available don't include a way to look up external data like birthdays. So, I need to inform the user that I don't have that information. \n\nBut the user wants a congratulatory message. If I can't find the birthday, I can't send a message. So, I should first check if there's any data in the core or archival memory. If not, I need to tell the user I can't find the birthday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo or is referring to themselves. But the question is about Shishir Patil, so I should proceed under the assumption that it's a different person. \n\nSince the functions don't allow me to access external databases, I can't retrieve the birthday. Therefore, I should respond that I don't have that information. But the user might expect me to use the send_message function. However, without the birthday, I can't create a message. \n\nWait, maybe the user is testing if I can use the core_memory_search function. Let me check the functions again. The recall_memory_search function can search the conversation history. But since this is the first message, there's nothing to search. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that I don't have access to Shishir Patil's birthday. Therefore, I should inform the user that I can't find the birthday and can't send the message. But the user might expect me to use the send_message function with a default message. However, the function requires the message content. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for a general congratulatory message, but that's not clear. The question is specific to Shishir Patil's birthday. \n\nIn this case, I should respond that I can't find the birthday information and thus can't send the message. But the user might have intended for me to use the core_memory or archival memory functions. However, without any data, I can't proceed. \n\nSo, the correct step is to inform the user that the birthday isn't available in the memory and thus can't send the message. But according to the functions, I can't do that. The only way to send a message is via send_message. So, if I can't find the birthday, I can't create the message. Therefore, I need to point out that the required information is missing."}

The account number is given, along with the account name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. However, the transaction_overview parameter expects a dictionary. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned specific numbers: starting balance $5,532.01, ending $6,737.37, deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40. The BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dict, so I need to structure that. But the function's parameters don't include the individual transactions, only the totals. However, the user also asked for a summary of transactions, which might require another function. \n\nLooking at the functions again, there's transaction_summary.generate which takes transactions list, dates, totals, balances, and customer info. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the transaction_overview in BankStatementOverView can include the totals. \n\nSo, the BankStatementOverView function can be called with the provided account details and a transaction_overview dictionary containing the starting balance, ending balance, total deposits, and withdrawals. The user didn't mention individual transactions, so maybe that's all that's needed for the overview. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is BankStatementOverView with the given parameters. The transaction_overview would be a dictionary with the specified values. The other functions like TransactionsV2 or Alltransactions might not be needed here since the user is asking for an overview, not to process individual transactions or retrieve a list."}

{"id": "live_multiple_61-23-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"what movies are playing in Noida today?\" Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which function to use. The user wants to know the movies playing in a specific city (Noida) today. The function get_movies seems appropriate because it retrieves movies in a city and cinema hall, with options to filter by date, language, and format. \n\nThe parameters required for get_movies are city, cinema_hall, movie_date, movie_language, and movie_format. The user mentioned Noida as the city. The date is today, so I need to calculate today's date in India's format, which is DD-MM-YYYY. Since the user didn't specify a cinema hall, I can leave that as default or maybe set it to an empty string. The movie_language and movie_format are optional, but since the user didn't specify, I can use default values. However, the function's parameters have defaults for cinema_hall, movie_language, and movie_format. Wait, looking back at the function definition for get_movies, the cinema_hall is a parameter but has no default. Wait, no, the function get_movies has cinema_hall as a required parameter? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the function definition for get_movies: the parameters are city (required), cinema_hall (required), movie_date (required), movie_language (optional), movie_format (optional). Wait, no, the function's args list shows that cinema_hall is a required parameter? Wait, the function's args are: city (str), cinema_hall (str), movie_date (str), movie_language (str), movie_format (str, default='2D'). Wait, no, the function's parameters are:\n\nArgs:\n    city (str): required\n    cinema_hall (str): required\n    movie_date (str): required\n    movie_language (str): optional\n    movie_format (str, default='2D'): optional\n\nWait, but in the function definition, cinema_hall is a required parameter. But the user hasn't specified a cinema hall. So, how to handle that? The user is asking for movies playing in Noida today, but not specifying a cinema hall. So, maybe the function requires the cinema hall, but the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, I need to ask the user to specify which cinema hall they are interested in. However, the user might not know the specific cinema hall, so maybe the function can handle it by leaving cinema_hall as an empty string? Wait, looking at the function's parameters, cinema_hall is a required parameter. So, the function can't be called without it. Therefore, the user's question is missing the cinema_hall parameter. \n\nBut wait, the user might be asking for all cinema halls in Noida. However, the function get_movies requires a specific cinema hall. Therefore, the user's question is incomplete. So, I need to ask the user to specify which cinema hall they are interested in. But the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, I should respond by asking for the cinema hall name. However, the user might not know it, so maybe the function can be called with an empty string? But according to the function's parameters, cinema_hall is required. Therefore, the function can't be called without it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function allows an empty string for cinema_hall, but the function's parameters don't indicate that. The function's description says \"the name of the cinema hall, for example 'PVR Logix', 'SARV Cinemas', or 'Miraj Cinemas'.\" So, perhaps the user needs to specify a cinema hall.

Maybe the function can be called without specifying a cinema hall, but according to the function's parameters, it's required. Therefore, the user's question is missing a required parameter. So, I need to ask the user to provide the cinema hall name. However, the user might not know it.

Wait, the cinema_hall is a required parameter, but the function's parameters don't have a default.

So the function call should include host, database, username, password, and omit port since it's optional and defaults to 5432.\n\nWait, the function's args list says port is an int with default 5432. So the user didn't specify a port, so we can leave it out. The parameters in the function call should be host, database, username, password. The port is optional, so it's okay to not include it.\n\nSo the function call would be add_postgres_server with those parameters. Let me make sure all the required parameters are included.

But the user says 'intermediate', so I'll use that as per their request.\n\nThe location is New York. The function requires the format 'City, State', so 'New York, NY' would be correct.

Because in the function definition, it's listed as a required argument. But the user hasn't specified a category. So, maybe the function requires the category to be provided. But the user didn't mention it. Hmm, this is a problem. The user's query doesn't specify a cuisine category, so maybe the function can be called without it? Or perhaps the category is optional? Wait, in the function's parameters, category is listed as a required argument? Or is it optional? The function's Args section shows category as a required parameter?

But the user hasn't specified a category. So, how to handle this? The user's query is to find restaurants in New York with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category is not specified, so maybe the function can be called without it? But according to the function's parameters, category is required. Therefore, perhaps the user's request is missing a parameter. However, maybe the category can be left as default? Wait, no, the function's parameters don't have a default for category. So, this is a problem. The user hasn't provided a category, but the function requires it. Therefore, maybe the function can't be called without it. But the user didn't specify a category.

The function for reserving a hotel is Hotels_4_ReserveHotel. The parameters needed are place_name, check_in_date, stay_length, location, and number_of_rooms. The user didn't specify the hotel name, so maybe leave that as default. Check-in date is July 15th, which should be in YYYY-MM-DD format, so 2023-07-15. Stay length is 5 days. Location is mentioned as \"the studio sessions\"\u2014wait, that's probably the place they're going to, but the hotel is in the same city.

But the user didn't mention the city. Wait, the original question says \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe there's a typo. The user might mean check-in on the 15th, staying 5 days, so check-out on the 19th. But the function requires check_in_date and stay_length. The user didn't specify the location, so maybe the default is 'dontcare', but that's not helpful. Wait, the user might have intended to say that the location is where the studio sessions are. But without knowing the city, maybe the function can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a specific city, but they didn't mention it. The user's message is a bit unclear. But given the functions, the user needs to provide location. Since the user didn't specify, maybe the function can't be called. But the user might have intended to say that the location is the same as the studio sessions. However, without knowing the city, the function can't be called. Wait, maybe the user is referring to a specific city, but they didn't mention it. So perhaps the function can't be called because the location is missing. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a specific city, but they didn't state it. So the answer would be that the location is required. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a city where the studio sessions are, but that's not clear. So the function call would need the location. Since the user didn't provide it, the function can't be called. But the user might have intended to provide the location. Wait, the original question says \"book on the 15th of July, 2staying for 5 days?\" Maybe the user meant check-in on the 15th, staying 5 days, so check-out on the 19th.

But the user might have intended to provide the location. Alternatively, maybe the location is the same as the studio sessions, but without knowing the city, it's impossible. So the correct response is to call the function with the available parameters, but since location is required and not provided, the function can't be called. Wait, the function has location as a default 'dontcare', but that's not helpful. So the user needs to provide the location. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the location is required. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out.

The destination must be in the format 'Street, City', like '134 Springoak Street, Chicago'. The user provided '3236 Grand Avenue, Oakland', which fits the format. The number_of_seats defaults to 1, which is probably okay unless specified otherwise. The ride_type defaults to 'Regular', but the user mentioned the most comfortable mode. So I should check if there's a ride_type that's considered comfortable. Maybe 'Comfort' or 'Luxury'? The function's ride_type parameter has a default of 'Regular', but the user wants the most comfortable, so perhaps 'Comfort' or 'Luxury' is the correct value here. However, the function's parameters don't list those options. Wait, the function's ride_type default is 'Regular', but maybe the possible values include 'Comfort' or 'Luxury'? The description says \"preferred ride type\", so maybe the user can specify 'Comfort' or 'Luxury' if those are valid options. Since the user wants the most comfortable, I should use 'Comfort' or 'Luxury' if those are valid. But the function's parameters don't specify the possible values, so maybe 'Comfort' is a valid ride_type. \n\nSo, the function call would be RideSharing_2_GetRide with destination as '3236 Grand Avenue, Oakland', number_of_seats as default 1, and ride_type as 'Comfort' or 'Luxury'. But since the function's ride_type default is 'Regular', maybe the user's request for 'most comfortable' is best represented by 'Comfort' or 'Luxury'.

The user wants to find songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic' and also explore tracks released around six years ago. Since the current year is 2023, six years ago would be 2017.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned two things: finding similar songs to an album and tracks from a specific year. Looking at the available functions, Music_3_LookupMusic seems appropriate because it allows searching based on album, genre, year, etc.\n\nFor the first part, similar songs to 'The New Classic' album. The Music_3_LookupMusic function has an 'album' parameter. Setting album to 'The New Classic' and maybe leaving genre as default (dontcare) would find songs from that album. But wait, the function's description says it finds songs that align with the user's preferences based on artist, album, genre, and year. So if we specify the album, it might return songs from that album or similar ones. However, the user wants similar songs, so maybe the function can handle that by specifying the album and perhaps other parameters. But the function's parameters don't have a 'similar' option. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to find songs in the same album or related ones. Alternatively, maybe the user wants songs from the same album, but the query says \"similar to those on the album,\" which might mean songs that are similar in style or genre. But the function's parameters don't have a 'genre' parameter that's adjustable. Wait, the function allows specifying genre, so maybe if we set the album to 'The New Classic' and leave genre as default, it would find songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, not necessarily from the same album. Maybe the function is designed to find songs that are similar based on the album's genre. But the function's parameters don't have a 'similar' option. Maybe the user is looking for songs from the same album, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the function can be used with the album parameter to find songs from that album, and then the year parameter to find tracks around 2017.\n\nWait, the user also wants tracks released around six years ago. Since 2023 minus 6 is 2017, the year parameter should be 2017. So the second part is to look for tracks from 2017. But the user wants to explore tracks released around six years ago, which is 2017. So the year parameter would be 2017.\n\nBut the first part is about similar songs to the album 'The New Classic'. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can take the album parameter. If we set album to 'The New Classic', and maybe leave genre as default, it might return songs from that album. However, the user might want songs similar in style, not necessarily from the same album. But given the function's parameters, maybe that's the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the function can use the album to find similar ones. But the function's description says it finds songs that align with the user's preferences based on the given criteria. So if the user specifies the album, it might return songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, so perhaps the function isn't the right one. Wait, the function is called LookupMusic, which might be for finding songs based on the given criteria. So if the user wants similar songs to an album, maybe the function can be used with the album parameter, and perhaps the genre parameter to find similar genres. But the user hasn't specified a genre, so maybe we can leave it as default. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to find songs that are similar in terms of the album's genre. But without more info, perhaps the best approach is to use the album parameter and the year parameter.\n\nSo the user's request is two-fold: find songs similar to the album 'The New Classic' and tracks from 2017. So maybe two function calls. First, use Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'? Wait, but the user wants similar songs to the album, not necessarily from 2017. Wait, the user says \"Additionally, I'd like to explore tracks released around six years ago.\" So that's a separate query. So the first part is similar to the album, the second part is tracks from 2017.\n\nBut how to handle the first part. The function Music_3_LookupMusic can take the album parameter. If we set album to 'The New Classic', and leave other parameters as default (artist, genre, year), then it would return songs from that album. But the user wants similar songs, not necessarily from the same album. However, given the function's parameters, maybe that's the only way. Alternatively, maybe the function can be used with the album and genre parameters. But the user hasn't specified a genre. So perhaps the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic', and the second is Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017'.\n\nWait, but the user wants similar songs to the album. Maybe the function can be used with the album parameter and the genre parameter. But without knowing the genre of the album, it's hard to specify. So maybe the first function call is to look up the album 'The New Classic' and the second is to look up tracks from 2017. But the user might want songs similar in style to the album, which would require knowing the genre. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the function can't be used for that part. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to find songs that are similar based on the album's genre. But without knowing the genre, perhaps the function can't do that. So maybe the first function call is to look up the album, and the second is to look up the year. But the user's first request is to find similar songs to the album. If the function can't do that, then maybe the answer is that the function can't be used. But the user is asking to use the functions provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function Music_3_LookupMusic can be used with the album parameter to find songs from that album, and then the year parameter to find tracks from 2017. So two separate function calls. The first one would be to look up the album 'The New Classic', and the second to look up tracks from 2017. That seems to fit the user's request. So the two function calls would be:\n\n1. Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and other parameters as default (artist='dontcare', genre='dontcare', year='dontcare').\n\n2. Music_3_LookupMusic with year='2017' and other parameters as default.\n\nBut the user wants similar songs to the album, which might not be the same as songs from the album. However, given the available functions, this might be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the function can be used with the album and genre parameters. But since the user hasn't specified a genre, perhaps the default is used. So the first function call is to look up the album, and the second is to look up the year. That's the best possible with the given functions."}

The date format needs to be MM/DD/YYYY, so April 23rd, 2023 would be 04/23/2023. The departure time is 13:45, which is in 24-hour format, so that's correct. The number of adults is 1. The user mentioned not to have trip protection, so trip_protection should be False.

The function requires _from and to in 'City, State' format, which the user provided. The date is correctly formatted as MM/DD/YYYY. The time is in HH:MM. Number of adults is an integer.

Wait, the function's parameters show that _class has a default of 'Value', so if the user doesn't specify, it uses that. Since the user didn't mention a class, we can leave it as default. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with the provided parameters."}

The album \"Gotta Be Me\" might be part of the results, but the function parameters don't include album, so maybe that's just a hint. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to play a specific track from that album, but since they didn't specify the track name, maybe the lookup is the first step. Then, once we have the list, we can use Music_3_PlayMedia to play the track. But the user hasn't specified a particular track yet, so maybe the lookup is needed first. Wait, the user said they heard that the album is good, so maybe they want to play something from that album. But the functions don't have a direct way to play an album. So perhaps first, use LookupMusic to find songs in Hillbilly style from 2019, then play one of them. Alternatively, maybe the album is part of the lookup. But the LookupMusic function's parameters are artist, album, genre, year. The user mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me,\" so maybe set album=\"Gotta Be Me\" in the lookup. But the user also mentioned Hillbilly style and 2019. So maybe call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\", and album=\"Gotta Be Me\". That might narrow it down. Then, once the songs are found, use PlayMedia to play the track. But the user hasn't specified a track yet, so maybe the first step is to look up the songs.

Alternatively, maybe the PlayMedia function can be called with the album and genre, but the PlayMedia function's parameters are track, artist, device, album. The user didn't specify the track, so maybe the lookup is needed first. So the correct approach is to first use LookupMusic to find songs in Hillbilly style from 2019, possibly from the album Gotta Be Me, and then play one of them.

I need to figure out what date that is. Assuming today is, say, October 25, 2023, this Friday would be October 27, 2023. But since the current date isn't provided, maybe the function expects the user to input the exact date. Wait, the user said \"this Friday,\" so maybe the function can handle that, but the parameter requires an ISO date. So I need to convert \"this Friday\" into the correct date. However, without knowing the current date, perhaps the user expects me to use the current date's Friday. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept \"this Friday\" as a parameter, but according to the function's args, the date is a string in ISO format. So I need to determine the actual date.

But wait, the user didn't specify the year. However, the function requires the date in ISO format. So I need to use the current year. If the current year is 2023, then the date is '2023-10-27'. But since the actual current date isn't provided, maybe the user expects the function to handle \"this Friday\" as a parameter. However, the function's date parameter is a string in ISO format, so the user must provide the exact date. Therefore, the assistant needs to infer the correct date based on the current date. Since the user hasn't provided the current date, perhaps the assistant should use the current date's Friday. But in the absence of that information, maybe the function expects the user to input the exact date. However, the user's question says \"this Friday,\" so the assistant should figure out the correct date. But since the assistant can't know the current date, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the current date's Friday. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept \"this Friday\" as a parameter, but according to the function's definition, the date is a string in ISO format. Therefore, the assistant must convert \"this Friday\" into the correct date. Assuming the current date is October 25, 2023, then this Friday is October 27, 2023. So the date parameter would be '2023-10-27'.\n\nSo the function call would be to ReserveRestaurant with those parameters.

The location is New York, NY. The restaurant name is Balthazar. Therefore, the correct function call is to use Restaurants_2_ReserveRestaurant with those parameters."}

The functions available are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user mentioned \"global application\", the create_global_application_alert_config is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for create_global_application_alert_config: name (string), alert_type (string), threshold (float), recipients (list), and enabled (bool, default True). The user provided the name, threshold as 5%, and recipients. But wait, the threshold is a float. 5% would be 0.05? Or maybe the alert_type is 'error rate' and the threshold is 5.0? The function's threshold is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. But maybe the alert_type is specified as 'error_rate' or similar. The user didn't mention the alert_type, so maybe it's implied. Wait, the function requires alert_type as a parameter. The user didn't specify it, so I need to figure that out. The question says \"error rate threshold of 5%\", so the alert_type should be something like 'error_rate' or 'error_rate_threshold'. But the function's parameters don't have a default for alert_type, so it's required. The user didn't mention it, so maybe I need to infer it. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is 'error' and the threshold is 5. But the function's threshold is a float. So perhaps the alert_type is 'error_rate' and threshold is 5.0. But the user said 5%, so maybe 0.05. Hmm, but the function's threshold is a float, so maybe the user intended 5.0 as the threshold. Wait, the user says \"error rate threshold of 5%\", which is 5% = 0.05. But maybe the system expects the threshold as a decimal. So I'll use 0.05 as the threshold. But the function's threshold is a float, so that's okay.\n\nSo the parameters would be: name='UrgentAlert77f7', alert_type='error_rate', threshold=0.05, recipients=['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com'], enabled=True (default). But the user didn't specify the alert_type, so maybe I need to assume it's 'error' or 'error_rate'. Since the user mentioned error rate, maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate'. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is 'error' and the threshold is 5.0. But the user said 5% error rate, so maybe the threshold is 5.0 and the alert_type is 'error_rate'. But the function's threshold is a float, so 5.0 would be 5.0, but 5% is 0.05. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. However, the user might have intended the threshold as 5.0, assuming that the alert_type is set to something that uses percentage. But since the function's threshold is a float, perhaps the user intended 5.0 as the threshold. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is 'error_rate' and the threshold is 5.0, which would be 5.0%? Or maybe the threshold is 0.05. But the user said 5%, so 0.05 is correct. However, the function's threshold is a float, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo the function call would be create_global_application_alert_config with name, alert_type (maybe 'error_rate'), threshold 0.05, recipients as the list of emails, and enabled True by default. But the user didn't specify the alert_type, so maybe that's an issue. Wait, the function requires alert_type as a parameter. The user didn't mention it, so I need to include it. But how? The user's question says \"error rate threshold of 5%\", so the alert_type should be something like 'error_rate'. So I'll have to include that. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"create_global_application_alert_config\"><params><param name=\"name\" value=\"UrgentAlert77f7\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"alert_type\" value=\"error_rate\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"threshold\" value=\"0.05\" type=\"float\"/><param name=\"recipients\" value=\"['admin@example.com', 'support@example.com']\" type=\"array\"/><param name=\"enabled\" value=\"True\" type=\"boolean\"/></params></function>\n\nBut wait, the threshold is 5% which is 0.05. But maybe the system expects the threshold as 5.0, assuming that the alert_type is set to something that uses percentage. However, the user's question says 5%, so 0.05 is correct. Alternatively, maybe the alert_type is 'error' and the threshold is 5.0. But the user said error rate, so 'error_rate' is more accurate. So I think that's the correct approach."}

But the user provided a user ID, which is specific to the CustomDashboardsApi function. \n\nWait, the user's query is about getting all API tokens. The CustomDashboardsApi function is for shareable tokens, while the APITokenApi is for regular tokens. But the user's user ID is 12345. Let me check the parameters again. The CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens takes user_id and include_revoked.

However, the APITokenApi might not require a user ID, but instead uses username and password for creating tokens. Wait, the APITokenApi.get_api_tokens doesn't take a user_id parameter. So maybe the user is using the CustomDashboardsApi to get shareable tokens, but the user ID is 12345. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused between the two functions. But the user's main request is to get all API tokens, so perhaps the correct function is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens. But the default for include_revoked is False. However, the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the APITokenApi is the right one, but the user didn't provide a username or password. \n\nWait, the user provided their user ID, which is 12345. The CustomDashboardsApi function requires user_id, which is provided. The other function, APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, doesn't take a user_id. So perhaps the user is referring to the shareable tokens, which are managed by the CustomDashboardsApi. Therefore, the correct function to call is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True to get all tokens.

But the get_api_tokens function doesn't require authentication, perhaps? Wait, the get_api_tokens function is part of the APITokenApi, which might require authentication. But the user hasn't provided credentials. However, the user has a user ID, which might be used in the CustomDashboardsApi function. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to use the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id=12345 and include_revoked=True. That would retrieve all shareable tokens, including revoked ones. But the user might not know about the include_revoked parameter. However, the user's request is to get all tokens, so that's the right call. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, but without a username or password, which are needed for that function. But the user hasn't provided those. Therefore, the only function that can be called with the given user ID is the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens\"><params><param name=\"user_id\" value=\"12345\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"include_revoked\" value=\"True\" type=\"boolean\"/></params></function>"}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' and 'experiences_and_education'. The first one seems to retrieve detailed info about specific experiences or education, while the second gives a list of experiences and education. The user is asking for specific education, so maybe 'detail_experience_and_education' is the right choice. \n\nThe parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' are 'experience_or_education_type' and 'experience_or_education_name'. The user mentioned \"education at UNS\", so the type should be 'education' and the name would be 'Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. \n\nWait, the function's args say that 'experience_or_education_name' has a default of 'Not specified'. But in this case, the user is specifying a particular education, so I should provide the name. \n\nSo the function call should be to 'detail_experience_and_education' with the type as 'education' and the name as 'Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)'. That should retrieve the specific education details Adriel has there."}
{"id": "live_multiple_1051-278-0", "result": "<functions><function name=\"set_alarm\"><params><param name=\"alarm_time\" value=\"2023-12-01 07:00:00\" type=\"string\"/><param name=\"purpose\" value=\"wake up\" type=\"string\"/></params></function></functions>", "input_token_count": 752, "output_token_count": 867, "latency": 10.072513818740845, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to wake up early for a meeting tomorrow, December 1, 2023, and set a reminder for 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's set_alarm and set_countdown. The user is asking for a reminder at a specific time, so set_alarm seems appropriate here. The set_countdown is for a countdown timer, which isn't needed here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for set_alarm: alarm_time can be in 24-hour format or 12-hour with AM/PM. The user specified 7:00 AM, which is 12-hour format with AM. The date is December 1, 2023, so the alarm_time should include that. The format examples include 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', so I should use '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"tomorro\" which is probably a typo for \"tomorrow\". So the date is 2023-12-1, but in the correct format, it should be 2023-12-01. Also, the time is 7:00 AM, which in 24-hour format is 07:00. But the function allows both 12-hour with AM/PM and 24-hour. So either '2023-12-01 07:00:00' or '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' would work. However, the function's example includes '9:30 AM' as a valid format. So maybe using '2023-12-01 7:00 AM' is acceptable. But the user might have intended the date as tomorrow, which is December 1, 2023. Wait, the current date isn't given, but the user says \"tomorro 2023-12-1\", which might be a typo. Assuming that the correct date is 2023-12-01. \n\nSo the alarm_time parameter would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' or '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. The purpose is 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The user mentioned a meeting, so the purpose could be 'meeting'. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'meeting'. Alternatively, using the 12-hour format with AM. But the function's example includes '9:30 AM' as a valid format. So maybe the user's input can be directly used as '2023-12-01 7:00 AM'. However, the function's parameters require the alarm_time to be in a standard format. The example given in the function's docstring includes '2023-06-01 09:30:00' which is a full date and time. So including the date is correct here. \n\nSo the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time set to '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose 'meeting'. Alternatively, if the user's input is '7:00 AM' without the date, but the user specified the date as 2023-12-1, so the date should be included. Therefore, the function call should include the date and time."}
