Wait, the function's param description says to separate multiple requests with comma and no space. The user's input has \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space after the comma. Do I need to adjust that? The function's instruction says to use comma with no space between. But the user's request is verbatim. Hmm, but the function's parameter expects the modification_request to be formatted with commas and no space. However, the user's input includes a space. Should I follow the user's exact wording or format it as per the function's requirement?\n\nWait, the function's param says: \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So the modification_request should be formatted with commas and no space. But the user provided \"no onions, extra cheese\" with a space. Should I modify it to \"no onions,extra cheese\" when passing to the function? Or is the function able to handle spaces? The function's description says the modification_request is a specific request detailing changes, so maybe the exact wording is important. However, the user said \"verbatim\", so maybe I should pass exactly what they wrote. But the function's parameter expects the comma with no space. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the user says \"modification verbatim: no onions, extra cheese\". So they want the exact text. But the function's parameter expects that if there are multiple requests, they should be separated by commas with no space. However, the user's input has a space. Should I adjust it to fit the function's required format? Or is the function able to parse it regardless? The function's parameter description says to separate with comma and no space, so maybe the user's input is not properly formatted. But the user wants it verbatim. This is a bit of a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can handle both cases. But to comply with the function's parameters, perhaps I should format it as \"no onions,extra cheese\" even if the user included a space. But the user specified \"verbatim\", which might mean they want the exact text. However, the function's parameter requires the comma with no space. So maybe the user's input is not properly formatted, but I have to follow the function's requirements. \n\nIn this case, the user's modification request is \"no onions, extra cheese\". The function expects the modification_request to be a string with multiple requests separated by commas with no space. So the correct format would be \"no onions,extra cheese\". But the user wrote \"extra cheese\" with a space. Should I adjust it? The user might have made a typo, but the function's parameter requires the comma with no space. Therefore, I should format it as \"no onions,extra cheese\" to meet the function's requirements, even if the user included a space. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle the space. But the function's parameter description says to use comma with no space. So I should follow that. \n\nTherefore, the modification_request should be \"no onions,extra cheese\". So the function call would be change_food with food_item \"burger\" and modification_request \"no onions,extra cheese\"."}
