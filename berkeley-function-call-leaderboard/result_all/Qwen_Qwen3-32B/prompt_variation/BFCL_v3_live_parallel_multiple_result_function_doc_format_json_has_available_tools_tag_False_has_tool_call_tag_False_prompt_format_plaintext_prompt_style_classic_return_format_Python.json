The user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. So for the food part, I need to use the ChaFod function. The parameters required are foodItem, and optionally newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients mentioned, so that can be default or empty. No special instructions mentioned either.\n\nThen for the drink, they mentioned order ID 123. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences is a dictionary with size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type, etc. The user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. So size is 'large', temperature is 'hot', sweetness_level 'regular', milk_type 'almond'. The drink_id is '123'. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For ChaFod, the removeIngredients is a comma-separated string, but here it's just one item. So \"anchovies\" is fine. For the drink, the new_preferences should be a dict with those parameters. Let me check the enum values to make sure they match. Size 'large' is valid, temperature 'hot' is allowed, sweetness_level 'regular' is correct, and milk_type 'almond' is in the enum. \n\nSo the function calls should be two separate ones: one for the food and one for the drink. The user didn't mention any new ingredients or special instructions for the salad, so those can be omitted or set to default. For the drink, all specified parameters are present. I think that's all. Let me structure the function calls accordingly."}

The user is asking to execute two commands: turn on the air conditioner in the living room and stop the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The ControlAppliance.execute function is designed for controlling home appliances. The parameters require a command in Korean, specifying the room, appliance, and action. The examples given include commands like '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the AC in the living room and '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping a washing machine. \n\nThe user's first command is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', which matches the example exactly. The second command is '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918'. The function's parameters mention that the command must be a string in Korean with room, appliance, and action separated by commas. The example for stopping uses '\uc911\uc9c0', so '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' should work. However, the user added '\ud574\uc918' at the end, which is a polite request, but the function's examples don't include that. I need to check if the function's parameters allow for such variations. The description says the command must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start' for control commands, and for checking status, include '\ud655\uc778'. Since '\uc911\uc9c0' is the correct command for stopping, even with '\ud574\uc918' appended, the function might still process it if it's in the correct format. However, the enum in the parameters lists specific examples, but the actual allowed values might be more flexible. The parameters' 'command' field has an enum with three examples, but the description says the command must be specified as a string in Korean with the structure. Since the user's commands fit the structure, even if not in the enum examples, it's acceptable. \n\nWait, the parameters for ControlAppliance.execute have an enum for 'command' with three specific strings. But the user's commands are different. For example, the user's second command is '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918', which isn't in the enum. However, the enum might just be examples, and the actual function might accept any string that follows the format. The description says the input must clearly specify the actions. So even if it's not in the enum, if it follows the structure, it should work. But the enum is part of the parameters, which might restrict it. Wait, looking back, the parameters for 'command' have an enum with three options. So the function expects one of those exact strings. The user's commands don't match those exact strings. The first command is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', which is in the enum. The second is '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918', which isn't. The enum entries are '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', and '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0'. So the second command's format is different. The room is specified, but the appliance is '\uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30' (air purifier) and the action is '\uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918'. The enum examples don't include air purifier or '\uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918'. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The function's parameters for 'command' have an enum that only includes specific commands. The user's second command isn't in the enum. Therefore, the function might not accept it. But maybe the enum is just examples, and the actual function allows any command that follows the structure. The description says the command must be specified as a string in Korean with room, appliance, and command. The enum might not cover all possibilities. For example, the user can specify any room, appliance, and action as long as they follow the format. However, the parameters' enum restricts it to the three examples. Wait, the parameters for 'command' have an enum with three specific strings. So the function can only accept those exact strings. Therefore, the user's second command isn't valid because it's not in the enum. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. The enum is probably just examples, not the only allowed values. The description says the command must be in the format of room, appliance, command. The enum is there to show examples, but the actual allowed values are any strings that follow that structure. The parameters' enum might be a mistake in the function definition. So, assuming that the function accepts any command that follows the format, even if not in the enum, I should proceed. \n\nTherefore, the two commands would be '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' and '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'. The '\ud574\uc918' part is just a polite ending and can be omitted. So the function calls would be two separate ControlAppliance.execute commands. However, the function's parameters require the 'command' to be a single string. So each command is a separate function call. \n\nSo the correct function calls are:\n\nControlAppliance.execute(command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'), ControlAppliance.execute(command='\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0')"}

The location is specified as 'Seoul, South Korea', which is in the enum, and units should be 'metric' for Celsius. So that's the first function call.\n\nNext, they want to turn on the air conditioner in the living room. The ControlAppliance.execute function requires a command in Korean. The example given is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', which translates to 'Living room, air conditioner, execute'. That should work here. So the second function call is ControlAppliance.execute with that command.\n\nThen, the user is asking about the Imjin War and wants up-to-date information. The HNA_WQA.search function can search the web. The keyword here would be 'Imjin War'. The parameters include keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user didn't specify language, so default to 'EN'. Result format can stay as default text unless specified, and max_results is 10 by default. So the third function call is HNA_WQA.search with keyword 'Imjin War'.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set and that the functions are called in the right order.

The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination is optional, but since the next steps refer to the repo directory, maybe I should clone it to a specific directory. Wait, the default is the current directory, so maybe just use that. So call clone_repo with repo_url.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory (assuming default destination), the directory_name would be the repo's root. Let's say the repo is cloned into a directory named 'nodejs-welcome'. Wait, but the clone_repo function's destination is '.', so the repo is cloned into the current directory. So the directory_name for analysis would be 'nodejs-welcome'? Or maybe the function expects the directory where the repo is cloned. Hmm, the user didn't specify a different directory, so probably the root. So call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, create/update Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. So after analysis, assuming the directory is 'nodejs-welcome', call that function with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen create Kubernetes YAMLs.

The user didn't specify, so use defaults. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nAfter modifying files, need to push changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name. Again, the repo is in 'nodejs-welcome'? Or maybe the current directory. Wait, the clone was done to '.', so the directory_name for push would be the repo's directory. But the user might have cloned it into a subdirectory. Wait, the initial clone_repo's destination is default '.', so if the repo is cloned into the current directory, then the directory_name for push would be the name of the cloned repo's directory. Assuming the repo URL git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git would clone into a directory named 'nodejs-welcome', so directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo the steps in functions would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs')\n\nWait, the user step 2.1 says create/update Dockerfile based on analysis. The analyse_repo_contents function's output (like the programming language) might influence the Dockerfile creation. But the functions provided don't pass that info; the create_a_docker_file just takes directory_name. So maybe the analysis is just to determine the language, and the Dockerfile is created accordingly. But the functions don't have parameters for language, so perhaps the create_a_docker_file is a generic one. The user's instruction says to create/update based on analysis, but the function just creates it. So assuming that the function can handle the language based on the directory's contents, which was analyzed. So proceed with the functions as they are.\n\nAlso, step 3 says to add all changed files to git. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So the push_git_changes_to_github function handles adding, committing, and pushing. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile and YAML, then push.\n\nSo the function calls in order would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nEach with the appropriate parameters. The directory_name for all except clone_repo is 'nodejs-welcome', assuming that's the directory name after cloning. The clone_repo's repo_url is given."}

First, they want updated information on significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021, but only including information published after 2022. The user specified \"verbatim,\" so I need to make sure I follow that exactly. The first function that comes to mind is the search_engine.query. The parameters required are 'prompt', and optionally 'include_after_year' and 'source'. Since they want info after 2022, I should set include_after_year to True. The prompt should be their query string.\n\nNext, they want a digital painting of a masked woman with specific details. The generate_image function seems appropriate here. The prompt parameter needs to capture all the details they mentioned: masked woman, peacock feathers, complex and elegant, green lines, cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha style. I'll need to structure that into a coherent prompt for the image generation. Also, check the parameters like resolution, color mode, etc. The user didn't specify those, so use defaults unless they mentioned something else. They didn't, so stick with the defaults for resolution and color mode.\n\nWait, the generate_human_image function is tailored for human subjects. But the user's description includes specific artistic elements like cyberpunk and Alphonse Mucha's style. The generate_image function might be more flexible for artistic styles beyond just human demographics. So I should use generate_image instead of generate_human_image here. The generate_human_image is more for basic human images, while generate_image allows for more creative and stylistic elements. That makes sense.\n\nSo, two function calls: one to search_engine.query with the prompt and include_after_year=True, and another to generate_image with the detailed artistic prompt. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the search, the prompt is \"significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021\", and include_after_year is True. For the image, the prompt includes all the specified elements. I think that's it. No other functions are needed here. The user didn't ask for multilingual support or anything else, so the other functions aren't necessary."}

The function 'recall_memory_search' can be used here. The query parameter should be \"Shishir's birthday\". Let me check the parameters: query is required, page defaults to 0. So I'll call that function with query=\"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nOnce I get the search results, if there's a match, I can note the date. Then, use 'send_message' to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir. The recipient would be Shishir's identifier, but the user hasn't provided it. Wait, the 'send_message' function has a default recipient of 'default@example.com', but that's probably not Shishir. The user might expect me to know the recipient, but since it's not given, maybe I should assume it's Shishir's actual contact info. However, since I don't have access to that, maybe the user expects a placeholder. But the function requires the recipient parameter. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to proceed with the available info. Alternatively, if the search result includes the recipient, maybe that's part of the data. But since the search is for the birthday, perhaps the recipient is known from context. Wait, the user mentioned \"our previous conversations\", so maybe Shishir is a user they've talked to before, and the recipient is stored in the memory. But without the actual data, I can't retrieve that. So perhaps the user expects me to proceed with the message, assuming the recipient is known. But the function requires the recipient parameter. Since it's not provided, maybe the default is used, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to proceed with the message, and the recipient is Shishir's actual contact, which I don't have. This is a problem. But since the user is asking to send the message regardless, maybe I should proceed with the message function, using the recipient as Shishir's known contact. However, since I don't have that info, perhaps the function call would need to include a placeholder. But the user might have intended that the recipient is already known. Alternatively, maybe the 'recall_memory_search' would return the recipient info. But without knowing the actual data, I can't be sure. So, perhaps the correct approach is to first perform the search, then based on the results, send the message. But since I can't execute the search here, I have to make the function calls step by step. So first, call recall_memory_search, then based on the result, call send_message. But in the current setup, I can only output the function calls. So the first step is to search, then send the message. But the user wants both actions. However, the system will process each function call in sequence. So the assistant should first call recall_memory_search, then send_message. But the send_message requires the recipient. If the search result includes the recipient, then that's good. Otherwise, maybe the user expects to use a default. But since the user hasn't provided the recipient, maybe the function call for send_message would have to use a placeholder, but that's not valid. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that Shishir's contact is already known, so the recipient is specified. But since I don't have that info, perhaps the user is expected to provide it. However, the user hasn't, so maybe the function call can't be completed. But the user says \"regardless\", so maybe proceed with the message even without the recipient? But the function requires 'message' as required, and 'recipient' has a default. Wait, looking at the send_message parameters: 'recipient' has a default of 'default@example.com'. So if the user hasn't provided the actual recipient, the function will use the default. But that's probably not Shishir. However, the user might have intended that the recipient is Shishir, but the system doesn't have his contact. So in this case, the function call would send the message to the default, which might not be correct. But the user's instruction is to send it regardless, so perhaps proceed with the function call. So the steps are: first, recall_memory_search to find the birthday, then send_message with the message. But the send_message requires the recipient. Since the user hasn't provided it, but the function has a default, maybe proceed with that. However, that's probably not the intended recipient. But given the constraints, the assistant can only use the functions provided. So the assistant would first call recall_memory_search, then send_message with the message and the default recipient. But the user might not want that. However, the user's instruction is to send the message regardless, so perhaps proceed. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\n[recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"shishir@example.com\", urgent=True)]\n\nBut since the recipient isn't provided, maybe the assistant should use the default.

But in the current setup, the assistant can only output the function calls. So the first function call is recall_memory_search, and then the next step would be send_message once the search result is known. However, the user is asking for both actions in one turn. Since the system processes each function call in sequence, the assistant should first call recall_memory_search, and then in the next turn, after receiving the search results, call send_message. But the user is asking to do both in one go. Since the assistant can't execute the search, it can only output the function calls. Therefore, the correct answer is to first call recall_memory_search, then send_message. But the send_message requires the recipient. Since the user hasn't provided it, but the function has a default, the assistant can proceed with the default. However, that's probably not correct. Alternatively, the assistant might need to ask for the recipient, but the user hasn't provided it. Given the constraints, the assistant can only proceed with the functions available. So the answer would be:\n\n[recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"default@example.com\")]\n\nBut the user might expect the recipient to be Shishir's actual contact. Since that's not provided, the assistant can't know. Therefore, the correct function calls are to first search, then send with the default recipient. However, the user might have intended that the recipient is Shishir, but without the actual contact info, the function can't be properly called. Therefore, the assistant should proceed with the available functions, even if the recipient is default. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the recipient is known from the search result. But since the search result isn't available, the assistant can't know. Therefore, the correct approach is to first perform the search, then send the message once the recipient is known. But in the current setup, the assistant can only output the function calls. So the first step is to call recall_memory_search, and then in the next step, after the search result is obtained, call send_message with the appropriate recipient. But since the user is asking to do both in one turn, the assistant can only output the first function call. However, the user's instruction says to send the message regardless, so maybe the assistant should proceed to send the message even without knowing the recipient. But the function requires the recipient parameter. Since it has a default, the assistant can proceed. Therefore, the function calls would be:\n\n[recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"default@example.com\")]\n\nBut this might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should only call the send_message if the search result is found. But since the assistant can't execute the search, it can't know. Therefore, the correct answer is to first call the search function, then the send message function with the default recipient. However, the user might have intended that the recipient is Shishir, but without the actual contact info, the function can't be properly called. Therefore, the assistant should proceed with the available functions, even if the recipient is default. So the final answer is the two function calls as above."}

They're working on a Java project and encountering a compilation error related to the 'StringNumberHandler' class extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The specific issue is that 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and since they didn't mention case sensitivity, I'll default to case-insensitive.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides. For this, the 'get_signature' function is the right choice. Each method requires the class name, method name, and optionally 'include_private'. Since these are public methods (as they're being overridden), 'include_private' can stay as default (False). I'll call 'get_signature' twice, once for each method.\n\nI should make sure all required parameters are provided. The 'class_name' and 'method_name' are required, so I'll include them. Also, the user mentioned Java, but the functions don't specify language, so I assume the functions are language-agnostic or the parameters are handled elsewhere. \n\nNo parameters are missing here.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd that takes two integers. The parameters required are a and b, both non-negative integers. Since 36 and 48 are both non-negative, I can use this function. So I'll need to call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, or does it matter which is which? The description says a is the first and larger integer. So I should make sure a is the larger one. 48 is larger than 36, so a=48 and b=36.\n\nNow the second part: the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. That's the derivative of the function at that point. The user mentioned \"how steep the curve is,\" which translates to finding the derivative. The function provided is f(x) = x\u00b2, so the derivative f'(x) = 2x. At x=5, that would be 10. But the user might want a numerical estimation using the estimate_derivative function. \n\nLooking at the parameters for estimate_derivative: it requires the function, x, and optionally dx and method. The default method is central, and dx is 0.0001. So I need to pass the function f(x) = x\u00b2, x=5. But how to represent the function? Since the function is a mathematical expression, I need to define it as a callable. In Python, that would be a lambda function or a defined function. The user's function is x squared, so I can represent it as lambda x: x**2. \n\nPutting it all together, the first function call is math_gcd(a=48, b=36). The second is estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5). The dx and method can be omitted since they have defaults. \n\nWait, but the user might not need the numerical estimation if they just want the exact derivative. However, the problem says \"how steep the curve is,\" which is the derivative. Since the function is simple, the exact derivative is 10, but the user might be expecting the numerical method's result. However, the estimate_derivative function is designed for cases where the exact derivative isn't easily computable. But since the user is asking for an estimation, perhaps using the central difference method with a small dx would give a value very close to 10. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call both functions as described. First, get the GCD, then estimate the derivative. The user might not know that the exact derivative is 10, so providing the numerical estimation via the function is appropriate here."}

So perhaps I should call the function twice, once with 'Music' and once with 'Theater'. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both if I use a different approach, but according to the parameters, it's a single string. So the correct approach is to make two separate calls. Wait, but the user's question is to find any events in either category. Since the function can only take one event_type at a time, I need to call it twice. However, the system might not allow multiple function calls in one turn. Wait, the instructions say to make one or more function calls. So I can list both function calls. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters are event_type and city. So first call: event_type='Music', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10'. Second call: event_type='Theater', same city and date. That way, both types are covered. The default for date is 'any', but the user specified March 10th, so setting date to '2023-03-10' is necessary. Therefore, the correct function calls are two instances of Events_3_FindEvents with the respective event types."}

First, they want to find a music event in New York on May 21, 2023. Looking at the available functions, the Events_3_FindEvents function seems appropriate. It requires event_type, city, and date. The user specified \"music event\" and \"New York\" with the date. So I'll use event_type='Music', city='New York, NY', and date='2023-05-21'.\n\nNext, they need a direct bus itinerary from Boston, MA to New York on the same date for 2 people. The Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice here. The required parameters are from_city, to_city, departure_date. They also mentioned direct, so category='direct' and num_passengers=2. The date is the same as the event, so departure_date='2023-05-21'.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For Events_3_FindEvents, event_type, city are required, and date is optional but provided. For Buses_3_FindBus, from_city, to_city, departure_date are required, with category and num_passengers as optional but specified by the user. Everything checks out. No missing parameters, so both functions can be called."}

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex (optional). The city should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so Sunnyvale, CA fits. The is_unisex can default to 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify.\n\nThen, for booking the appointment, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is required. It needs stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user provided all three: 'Elegant Styles', 15:00, and 2023-05-10. So both functions can be called with the given parameters. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The date is already in 'YYYY-MM-DD' and time in 'HH:MM'. So both functions are applicable here. No missing parameters. So the answer should include both function calls."}

So I can call get_current_weather with location='Boston, MA' and unit='fahrenheit' to be explicit.\n\nNext, San Francisco. The user just said 'San Francisco', but the function requires the state abbreviation. San Francisco is in CA, so I should format it as 'San Francisco, CA'. The user also mentioned 'fahr', which is short for Fahrenheit. So the unit parameter should be 'fahrenheit' again.\n\nI need to make two separate function calls for each location. Let me make sure there are no typos in the parameters. The function names are correct, and the parameters are properly formatted. No other functions are needed here since the user is only asking about weather."}

Hmm, looking at the available functions, there's user.mandates which fetches mandates for a user based on name and status. The parameters required are name and status. The status can be active, pending, or inactive. The default is active.\n\nSo for each user, Parath and Bhanu, I need to get both pending and active mandates. But the function allows only one status at a time. Wait, the user wants both pending and active. How to handle that? Maybe make two separate calls for each user: one with status 'active' and another with 'pending'. But that would be four calls in total. Alternatively, check if the function can accept multiple statuses, but looking at the parameters, the status is a single string with enum values. So no, it can't handle multiple statuses in one call.\n\nSo the correct approach is to call user.mandates for each user and each status. So for Parath, first get active, then pending. Same for Bhanu. So four function calls. Let me list them:\n\n1. user.mandates(name='parath', status='active')\n2. user.mandates(name='parath', status='pending')\n3. user.mandates(name='bhanu', status='active')\n4. user.mandates(name='bhanu', status='pending')\n\nThat should cover all the required mandates. The partner.mandates function isn't needed here because the user is asking about specific users, not the partner's mandates. So the answer should be these four function calls."}
