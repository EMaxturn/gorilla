The province is Chiang Mai, so province_id 2. The district is Sankampang, and the subdistrict is Ton Pao. The rating is 4.5, which is a float. The start and end dates are not provided, so maybe they are default or not needed. The has_late_check_in is a boolean, but the user didn't mention it, so maybe leave it as default.\n\nSo the parameters should be service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', rating=4.5. The other parameters like start and end dates can be omitted since they aren't provided. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required fields are service_id and province_id. The user didn't mention start or end dates, so those can be left out. The has_late_check_in is optional, so it's not necessary. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be getDataForProfessional with those parameters."}
