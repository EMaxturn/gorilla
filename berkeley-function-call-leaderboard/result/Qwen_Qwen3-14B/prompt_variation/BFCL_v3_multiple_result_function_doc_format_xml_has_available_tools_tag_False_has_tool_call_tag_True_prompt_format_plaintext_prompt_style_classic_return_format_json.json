It requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. Rounding isn't specified, so maybe I can leave it out or set to a default. The function should handle that. \n\nWait, the parameters in the function are all integers. The user's inputs are all integers, so that's fine. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed.

The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, and region is United States. So I need to call store_price with these parameters. There's no mention of needing to check if it's on sale first, but since the question is about the selling price, store_price should give the current price, which might be on sale or not.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, but maybe the function assumes that if not provided. The parameters required are distance and time, which are both given here: 20 meters and 4 seconds. So I can call this function with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed isn't needed here because the function's description says it starts from rest. \n\nAlternatively, there's another function 'calculate_acceleration' but that requires initial and final speed, which we don't have. But since the user is asking for speed, not acceleration, the first function is the right choice. \n\nSo the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20 and time 4. The initial_speed isn't provided, but since the function's description says it starts from rest, maybe it defaults to 0. So the parameters are distance=20, time=4. That should give the final speed."}

The month is upcoming, so maybe leave it as default or set it to the current month. But the parameter says the default returns upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is better. Also, they want top-rated, so user_ratings should be set to 'high' or the default, which is 'high'. \n\nWait, the user_ratings parameter's default is 'high', so even if not specified, it would default to high ratings. So the function call would need location: \"New York, NY\", art_form: \"sculpture\", and maybe month as the upcoming month. But the user says \"upcoming month\", which might mean the next month. However, the parameter's default is to return upcoming events, so maybe not specifying the month is okay. Let me check the function's description again. The month parameter's default is to return upcoming events. So if we don't specify the month, it should handle it. \n\nSo the function call would be find_exhibition with location \"New York, NY\", art_form \"sculpture\", and user_ratings \"high\" (though default is already high, but maybe specifying it to be safe).
