The function data_loading is available for that. The parameters required are file_path and an optional delimiter, which defaults to ','. So I should call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. Assuming the data is a dictionary or similar structure, x would be data['sales'] and y data['future_sales'].\n\nThen, use the linear_regression_fit function. The parameters x and y are required, and return_residuals should be set to True. So the call would include x, y, and return_residuals=True.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the data from the loaded file into the linear regression function? The user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so I need to make sure that after loading the data, those columns are correctly passed as parameters. Since each function call is separate, I need to first load the data, then use that data in the linear regression. But in the system's setup, each function call is separate, so maybe the data_loading function returns the data structure, which can then be used in the next function. However, the way the functions are structured here, each function call is standalone. So perhaps the user expects me to first load the data, then call the linear regression with the appropriate columns. But since the functions don't have memory between calls, maybe the parameters for x and y need to be the actual arrays from the data. So the correct approach is to first call data_loading to get the data, then extract the x and y arrays from it, and then pass those into the linear_regression_fit. However, in the current setup, each function call is separate, so the assistant needs to make two separate function calls: first to load the data, then to fit the model using the loaded data's columns. But the problem is that the parameters for x and y in the linear regression would need to be the actual arrays from the data. Since the assistant can't execute code, it can only generate the function calls. Therefore, the correct sequence is to first call data_loading, then use the returned data to get x and y, and then call linear_regression_fit with those arrays and return_residuals=True. However, the user's instruction is to generate the function calls. So the first step is to load the data. Then, assuming that the data is loaded into a variable called data, the next step is to call the linear regression function with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True. But since the assistant can't know the actual data structure, it's up to the user to have the data in the correct format. Therefore, the assistant should generate two function calls: first data_loading, then linear_regression_fit with the appropriate parameters. However, the parameters for x and y in the linear regression would need to reference the data from the loaded file. Since the assistant can't execute code, it can only generate the function calls as per the user's instruction. Therefore, the correct answer is to first call data_loading to load the dataset, then call linear_regression_fit with x and y as the respective columns and return_residuals=True."}

For the first one, it's a 4ft x 4ft marble statue in Philadelphia. The second is 6ft x 3ft bronze in New York. The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nSo, for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with their respective parameters. The size needs to be an array of integers. Let me convert the feet measurements. Assuming 4ft x 4ft would be [4,4], and 6ft x 3ft would be [6,3]. \n\nBut wait, the function parameters for sculpture_size is an array of integers. Does that mean height, width, depth? The user provided two dimensions, so maybe it's 2D? The function might expect three dimensions, but the user only gave two. Hmm, maybe the third is optional or assumed to be 1? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Since the function requires an array, I'll use the given two values as the size.\n\nSo first call for Philadelphia marble [4,4], then New York bronze [6,3]. Then average the two prices. But the functions don't calculate averages, so I need to get both prices and compute the average externally. Since the user is asking for the average, I need to make two separate function calls for each sculpture's price and then average them. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call get_artwork_price twice with each set of parameters, then compute the average.

So I'll call calc_energy with mols=5 and substance=\"C6H12O6\".\n\nSecond, calculating biomass using the energy from the first step with 10% efficiency. The function biological.calc_biomass requires energy and efficiency. Since efficiency defaults to 0.1 (10%), I just need to pass the energy value from the first calculation.

Again, using the same energy from the first step and distance=2. So calc_work(energy=energy_result, distance=2).\n\nWait, but in the function calls, I can't reference previous results directly. Each function call must be independent. So for the second and third steps, I need to use the same energy value calculated in the first step. However, since the user wants each step done in order, the actual implementation would use the output of the first function in the subsequent ones. But in the response format, I need to list each function call with the parameters as they would be when called, assuming previous results are available.
