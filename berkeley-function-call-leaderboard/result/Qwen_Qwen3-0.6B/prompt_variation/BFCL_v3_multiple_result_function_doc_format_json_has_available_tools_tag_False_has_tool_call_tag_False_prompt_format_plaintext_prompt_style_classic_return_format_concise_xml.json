The functions available are kinematics.calculate_displacement and kinematics.calculate_final_speed. \n\nThe question is about displacement, so I should use calculate_displacement. The parameters needed are initial_speed, acceleration, and time. The user provided all three: 20, 10, and 5. The required parameters are all present. The function requires initial_speed as an integer, acceleration as an integer, and time as an integer. The user's values fit here. There's no mention of rounding, so maybe the default of 2 decimals is okay. \n\nWait, the parameters in the function have default for rounding. The user didn't specify rounding, so maybe we don't need to include it. So the function call should be calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. That should give the displacement. I don't see any missing parameters here. The other function is for final speed, which isn't needed here. So the correct function call is to use calculate_displacement with those values."}

The formula for speed when starting from rest is probably the one that relates initial velocity, acceleration, and time. \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. The user provided all three: distance is 20, time is 4, and initial_speed is 0. So I can use this function. The function's required parameters are distance and time, and initial_speed is optional. Since the user mentioned starting from rest, initial_speed is 0. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as an integer with a default of 0.

That should give the speed. \n\nI don't need to use the other function because the question is specifically about speed starting from rest.
