The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The user provided the height as 150 meters and the initial velocity as zero. The gravity parameter has a default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2, so if the user doesn't specify it, we can use that.\n\nSince the initial velocity is given as zero, I can set that in the parameters.

For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance. Multiplying them together gives (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. But wait, the user mentioned a six-sided die, so the die_sides parameter is 6.

The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", but the function's start_date is the start of the range. So using 01-01-2021 would include lawsuits filed on or after that date.

Since assumeMajor is true, it will look for a major key first. The answer should be the key that fits this progression. The user probably wants the most likely key, so the first valid one returned by the function. No errors here; the parameters are sufficient. The function should handle it as is."}

The user is asking for the schedule of Manchester United for the next 6 games in the Premier League. I need to use the sports_team.get_schedule function. Let me check the parameters required.\n\nThe function requires team_name, num_of_games, league, and optionally location. The user provided team_name as Manchester United, num_of_games as 6, and league as Premier League. There's no mention of a specific location, so I can omit that parameter. \n\nWait, the league argument is optional? The function's docstring says that if league isn't provided, it fetches all games regardless of league. But the user specified Premier League, so I should include that. All the required parameters are present. So the function call should have team_name=\"Manchester United\", num_of_games=6, league=\"Premier League\". Location isn't needed here. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The team name is a string, number of games is integer, league is a string. Yep, that's all set. So the function call should be correct."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the boardgame.get_info function. The parameters needed are name, parameters, and language. The name is given as 'Ticket to Ride'. The parameters they want are rating and player count, which I think correspond to 'rating' and 'players' in the function's parameters list. The language is default English, so I don't need to specify that unless they want another language. So I should call the function with name=\"Ticket to Ride\" and parameters=[\"rating\", \"players\"]. Let me make sure those are the correct parameter names. The function's args say 'parameters' is a list of game characteristics, so including those two should work."}

The user didn't mention a custom deck, so the default standard deck will be used. I need to call the function with rank 'Queen' and suit 'Hearts'. Since deck isn't provided, the function will use the standard one. So the correct function call is find_card_in_deck with those parameters. No other parameters are needed. I'll make sure to format it correctly as per the instructions."}

Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The preference here is pet-friendly. The function's preferences parameter is a list, so I should include \"pet friendly\" in that list.\n\nWait, the start_date format might need to be a string. The example doesn't specify the format, but March 10th, 2023 could be written as \"2023-03-10\" to be unambiguous. \n\nSo putting it all together: location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is \"single\", duration is 3, start_date is \"2023-03-10\", and preferences is [\"pet friendly\"]. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires location, room_type, duration, start_date. The user provided all of these.
