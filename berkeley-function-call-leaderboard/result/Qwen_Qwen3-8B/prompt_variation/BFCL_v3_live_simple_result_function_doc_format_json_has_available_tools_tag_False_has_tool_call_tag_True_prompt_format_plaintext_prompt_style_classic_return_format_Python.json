There's the uber.ride function. The parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc should be in 'Address, City, State' format. The user provided the address as 123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704. Wait, the state is CA, which is correct. But the address format might need to be in English. The example given was '123 Main St, Springfield, IL'. The user's address uses Vietnamese, but maybe the function can handle it. However, maybe the system expects English addresses. But the function's description doesn't specify that, so I should use the address as provided.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which matches the enum values (plus, comfort, black).
