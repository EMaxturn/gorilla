However, the user might not have provided them, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the available info and assume dates? But according to the function's definition, those parameters are required. \n\nWait, looking back at the function's Args, the start_available_date and end_available_date are listed without default values. So they are required. Therefore, the user's question is missing these parameters. But the user might not know they are required. So the assistant should point out that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might not have provided them, so maybe the assistant should proceed by setting them to some default or omitting? But according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. \n\nBut the user's question is to find a housewife, so maybe the availability dates are not specified. However, the function requires them. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might not have provided them, so the assistant should mention that. But the problem says to make function calls if possible. If the parameters are missing, the assistant can't call the function. So in this case, the assistant should point out that the start_available_date and end_available_date are missing. \n\nBut the user's question doesn't mention dates. So the assistant should inform the user that those parameters are required but not provided. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, point it out.
