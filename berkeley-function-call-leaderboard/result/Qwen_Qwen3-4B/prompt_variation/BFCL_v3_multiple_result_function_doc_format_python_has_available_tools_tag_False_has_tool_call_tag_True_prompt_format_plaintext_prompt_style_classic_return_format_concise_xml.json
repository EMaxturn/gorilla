Since the question is about displacement, I should use the calculate_displacement function.\n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_displacement: initial_speed (int), acceleration (int), time (int), and rounding (optional int). The user provided all the required parameters: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. Rounding isn't specified, so maybe use the default of 2 decimals.

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price, I should use store_price. The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided, so I can call store_price with these values. The other functions don't relate to price, so they aren't needed here.

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, both integers.

Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the final speed. The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I can use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That should give the final speed.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they are the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they are the same gas, the formula simplifies.\n\nThe formula is: (quantity1 * temperature1) + (quantity2 * temperature2) = (quantity1 + quantity2) * final_temperature. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (2 * 300) + (3 * 400) = (2 + 3) * T. Calculating the left side: 600 + 1200 = 1800. Then 1800 divided by 5 (since 2+3=5) gives 360 K. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. So I need to call that function with the given values. The parameters are all integers here. So the function call should be calculate_final_temperature with quantity1=2, temperature1=300, quantity2=3, temperature2=400. \n\nI don't need to use the calculate_mass function here because the question is about temperature mixing, not mass.

So I need to call sort_list with elements=['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order='asc'. Wait, but the default is already 'asc', so maybe I can omit the order parameter. But to be explicit, maybe include it. The function's parameters say order is optional with default 'asc'. So the correct call would be sort_list with elements and order set to 'asc'.

So I need to call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7 and n_rolls=2. Wait, the sides_per_die is optional, right? Since the user didn't specify any other type of dice, like 10-sided, I can assume 6. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, and sides_per_die=6.
