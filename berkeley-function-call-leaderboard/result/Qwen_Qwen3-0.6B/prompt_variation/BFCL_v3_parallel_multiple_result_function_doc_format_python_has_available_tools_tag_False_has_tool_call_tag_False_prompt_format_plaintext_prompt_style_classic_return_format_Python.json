Then the area is sqrt(12*(12-7)*(12-10)*(12-5)) = sqrt(12*5*2*7) = sqrt(840). Let me check if that's correct. Yes, Heron's formula works here.\n\nNext, the triangle with base 8 and height 6.

The default for efficiency is 10%, so maybe I don't need to specify it, but since the user provided it, I should include it. Wait, the function's efficiency is a default of 0.1, but the user mentioned 10%, so I should set it explicitly.\n\nSecond part: Calculate biomass given energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step is the total energy, and the efficiency is 10%. So, I need to use biological.calc_biomass with the energy value and efficiency. The default for biomass is 100%? Or maybe the function expects a specific value. Wait, the function's description says it calculates biomass from energy with the given efficiency. So, the energy parameter is the total energy, and the efficiency is applied. So, the biomass would be energy * efficiency / 100? Or maybe biomass = energy / efficiency? Wait, the efficiency is the percentage of energy converted into biomass. So, if the efficiency is 10%, then biomass is (energy * 0.1). So, yes, biomass = energy * efficiency / 100.\n\nThird part: Calculate work done by the machine. The machine moves 2 meters, and the energy is from the first step. The work done is energy * distance.

The formula is principal * rate * time. So, principle is 5000, rate 4% which is 0.04, time 5. So that's 5000 * 0.04 * 5. Let me calculate that. 5000 * 0.04 is 200, times 5 is 1000.

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The house has an area of 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985. The function predict_house_price needs those parameters. So I'll call that function with area=2000, rooms=4, year=1985, location=San Francisco.\n\nNext, they want to know about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function requires entity, county, and state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. So I'll call lawsuit_search with entity=John Doe, county=San Francisco, state=California.\n\nThen, the probability part: total outcomes 1000, favorable 5, rounded to 3 decimals. The calculate_probability function takes total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. So I'll use that with round_to=3.\n\nWait, are all the parameters provided? The user mentioned all the details, so each function call should have the correct parameters. Let me check again. Yes, all required parameters are there. No missing info. So three function calls: predict_house_price, lawsuit_search, calculate_probability."}

They have four different requests, each requiring a function call. I need to check which functions are available and ensure all parameters are correctly provided.\n\nFirst, the user wants to know the types of fish in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. The function get_collectables_in_season is suitable here. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they want the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function can handle this. The parameters are game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia, so I'll input those.\n\nThird, the lawsuits details for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function requires company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided Apple Inc. and 2018, but the case_type isn't mentioned. Since it's optional, I'll leave it out as the default is all.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function needs number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. All parameters are there.\n\nI need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the parameters. No missing parameters, so all four function calls should be valid. Let me structure them properly."}
