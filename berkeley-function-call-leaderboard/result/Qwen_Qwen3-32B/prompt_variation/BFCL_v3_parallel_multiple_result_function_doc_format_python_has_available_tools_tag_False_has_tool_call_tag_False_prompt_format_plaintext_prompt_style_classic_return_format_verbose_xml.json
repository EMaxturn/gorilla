The user wants to use data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model where x is 'sales' and y is 'future_sales', and also calculate residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data. The data_loading function can do that. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The user mentioned dataset.csv, so file_path is \"dataset.csv\". Delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which is fine.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. But the function parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as lists. Assuming the data_loading returns a data structure like a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame, I need to make sure that the columns are accessible. However, the exact structure isn't specified here. The user says x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so I'll assume that after loading, those columns are available as lists.\n\nSo the steps are: first call data_loading with the file path. Then, use the returned data to get x and y. Then call linear_regression_fit with those x and y, and set return_residuals to True.\n\nWait, but the functions are supposed to be called in sequence. The problem is that the linear_regression_fit depends on the output of data_loading. However, in the current setup, each function call is independent. So how does the system handle passing data between functions? Since the user is expecting me to generate the function calls in order, I need to make sure that the output of data_loading is available for the next step.\n\nBut in the current format, each function call is separate. So the assistant would first call data_loading, then linear_regression_fit. The system would execute them in order, so the data from the first call would be available for the second. But how are the variables named? The user says x=data['sales'], so maybe in the second function, the x and y parameters would be the lists extracted from the loaded data.\n\nWait, but the parameters for linear_regression_fit are x and y as lists. So the data_loading function must return a data structure where we can extract those columns. Let me think. If the data is loaded into a dictionary or a DataFrame, then the user's code would be something like data = data_loading(...), then x = data['sales'], y = data['future_sales'].\n\nBut in the function calls, how do I represent that? The problem is that the user's instruction requires multiple steps: load data, process it to get x and y, then fit the model. However, the available functions are only data_loading and linear_regression_fit. There's no function to extract columns, so I have to assume that the data_loading function returns a structure where the columns can be accessed directly.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first call data_loading to get the data, then call linear_regression_fit with x and y as the respective columns, and return_residuals set to True.\n\nSo the first function call is data_loading with file_path=\"dataset.csv\". Then, the second function is linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the function call syntax, how do I reference the data from the previous step? The problem is that the parameters for the second function depend on the output of the first. However, in the current setup, each function call is standalone. The user's system must handle passing data between them. So the assistant just needs to generate the correct sequence of function calls, assuming that the output of the first is available in the second.\n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are:\n\n1. data_loading with file_path=\"dataset.csv\"\n2. linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], return_residuals=True\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. For the linear_regression_fit, x and y are lists (arrays), and return_residuals is a boolean. The user specified to calculate and return the residuals, so return_residuals must be True.\n\nSo the final answer should be two function calls in order."}

They mentioned glucose (C6H12O6) and the default joules_per_mol is 2800, which matches the given value. So I'll call calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and since the default is already 2800, maybe I don't need to specify it, but to be safe, I can include it explicitly.\n\nSecond, calculating biomass using biological.calc_biomass.

John has three investment options, and I need to calculate the returns for each using the given functions. Let me break down each option one by one.\n\nFirst option: simple interest. The problem states $5000 principal, 5 years, 4% annual rate. The function provided is calc_Simple_Interest, which requires principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. All parameters are present here. The annual rate is given as a percentage, so I can input 4 directly as a float.\n\nSecond option: compound interest. Here, the principal is $5000, duration 5 years, annual rate 3.5%, compounded annually. The function calc_Compound_Interest needs principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq should be 1. The annual rate is 3.5, so I'll use that as a float.\n\nThird option: initial investment of $3000, 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. The problem mentions using the future_value function here. Let me check the parameters for future_value. It needs initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The annual rate is 5%, so as a decimal that's 0.05. Time is 6 years, and compounding twice a year means num_compoundings is 2. Wait, but the function's num_compoundings is per time period. Since the time is in years, and it's compounded twice a year, that's correct. So the parameters are initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2.\n\nWait, but the third option's function is specified as future_value. Let me confirm. The user says to use future_value for the third option. The third option's details: $3000 initial, 5% annual rate (so 0.05 as a decimal), 6 years, compounded twice a year. So yes, future_value's parameters fit here. The other two options are to use calc_Simple_Interest and calc_Compound_Interest. So the three functions are each for the three options.\n\nNow, I need to make sure all parameters are correctly converted. For the first two functions, annual_rate is in percentage (so 4 and 3.5), while future_value's interest_rate is a decimal (so 0.05). That's important. Also, for the compound interest, the compound_freq is 1 for annually. \n\nSo the three function calls would be:\n\n1. calc_Simple_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4.0\n2. calc_Compound_Interest with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5, compound_freq=1\n3. future_value with initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2\n\nI need to check if all parameters are present. For the first two, yes. The third has all required parameters. The future_value function has a default for num_compoundings, but since it's provided here, we include it. All set."}

The user has multiple tasks here. First, they need to modify a painting's attributes. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, red. The function modify_painting can handle that. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. So I'll call modify_painting with those new values.\n\nNext, they want to predict the evolutionary rate of African elephants for 100 years using the Darwin model. The function prediction.evolution requires species, years, and model. So I'll set species to \"African elephant\", years to 100, and model to \"Darwin\".\n\nThen, calculate the probability of a royal flush. The function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes. In poker, a deck has 52 cards, and there are 4 possible royal flushes. The total possible 5-card hands is C(52,5) which is 2,598,960. So total_outcomes is 2598960, favorable_outcomes is 4. They also want it rounded to 3 decimal places, so round_to=3.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the painting, the size is a string like \"30x40\", medium is \"oil\", color is \"red\". For the evolution, species is a string, years 100, model \"Darwin\". For probability, the numbers are correct. All functions are applicable here, so I can proceed to call them all in one turn."}

The user has three main requests here. First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco with specific details. Then, they need information on lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco County. Lastly, they want the probability of winning a lottery with given numbers rounded to three decimals.\n\nStarting with the house price prediction. The function predict_house_price requires area, rooms, year, and location. The user provided all these: 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, 1985, and San Francisco. So I can call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The function lawsuit_search needs entity, county, and state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and since the state isn't specified, it defaults to California. So that's covered. I'll use the function with those parameters.\n\nFor the lottery probability, calculate_probability needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The user mentioned 1000 total, 5 favorable, and rounding to 3 decimals. The default for round_to is 2, but here it's specified as 3, so I'll include that.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped. No missing parameters in any of the functions. So three separate function calls should handle each part of the query. Let me structure them properly in the required format."}

First, they want to know the collectable fish in Animal Crossing during summer. The get_collectables_in_season function seems right. I need to set game_name to 'Animal Crossing', season to 'Summer', and item_type to 'fish'. \n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. So game is 'Fortnite', platform 'Playstation', region 'Asia'.\n\nThen, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name 'Apple Inc.', year 2018. Case_type isn't specified, so maybe leave it out or default.\n\nLastly, binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, 0.7 probability. The calculate_binomial_probability function takes those parameters directly. Check if all required args are there. All set.
