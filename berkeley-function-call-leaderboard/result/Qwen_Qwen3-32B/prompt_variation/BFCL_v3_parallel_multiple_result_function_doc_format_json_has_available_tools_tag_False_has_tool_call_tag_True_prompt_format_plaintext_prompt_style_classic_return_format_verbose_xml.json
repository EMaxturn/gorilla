Each requires a separate function call because the country parameter is specific. The species is the same (tiger), but the country and time frame (years) differ.

The user wants to use data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model where x is data['sales'] and y is data['future_sales'], and also calculate the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data from the CSV file. The function data_loading is available for that. The parameters required are file_path and an optional delimiter. The user mentioned dataset.csv, so the file_path is 'dataset.csv'. The delimiter defaults to comma, which is fine unless specified otherwise.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. But the functions provided don't include a data extraction tool. Wait, the functions given are data_loading and linear_regression_fit. The user is supposed to use these functions. So after loading the data, I have to assume that the data structure (like a DataFrame) allows accessing columns via keys like data['sales'].\n\nSo the next step is to call linear_regression_fit with x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], and set return_residuals to True. But how do I pass those columns as arrays? The parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as arrays of floats. So the data_loading function should return a data structure where we can index those columns. But since the user is writing code, maybe they know how to extract those columns. However, in the function calls, I can only use the provided functions. So the user must have to load the data first, then pass the appropriate columns to the regression function.\n\nBut in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to chain the function calls. So first, call data_loading to get the data. Then, use the output of that (assuming it's stored in a variable like 'data') to extract the columns. However, the function calls are separate. Wait, the problem is that the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y to be arrays. But how does the assistant know that data['sales'] is an array? The user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so the assistant needs to first load the data, then pass those columns to the regression function.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is:\n\n1. Call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv' to load the data into a variable (let's say 'data').\n2. Then, call linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the tool call format, how do we represent this? Each function call is separate. The assistant needs to output both function calls in order. So the first tool call is data_loading, then the second is linear_regression_fit using the data from the first call.\n\nBut the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as arrays. The data_loading function's output is a data structure (probably a dictionary or DataFrame) that has 'sales' and 'future_sales' keys. So the assistant must assume that after loading, those columns are accessible as arrays.\n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are:\n\nFirst, data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'. Then, linear_regression_fit with x=data['sales'], y=data['future_sales'], and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the tool call format, how to reference the data from the first call? The problem is that the assistant can't reference previous outputs directly in the parameters. Wait, the user's instruction is to use the data from dataset.csv and set x and y accordingly. The assistant needs to generate the necessary function calls in order. So the first step is to load the data, then the second step is to fit the model using that data. The parameters for the second function would be based on the data loaded in the first step. However, in the tool call format, each function is called independently. So the assistant must generate both function calls, assuming that the data is available after the first call.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to first call data_loading, then call linear_regression_fit with the appropriate parameters. The parameters for x and y would be the columns from the loaded data. The assistant must represent this as two separate function calls in the tool_call section."}

For the first one, it's a 4ft x 4ft marble statue in Philadelphia. The second is 6ft x 3ft bronze in New York. The get_artwork_price function requires museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nSo for each sculpture, I need to call get_artwork_price with those parameters. The size needs to be an array of integers. The first sculpture's size is 4x4, so [4,4]. The second is 6x3, so [6,3]. The materials are marble and bronze.

The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I'll plug in 5000, 5, and 4.

The user has multiple tasks here. First, they need to modify a painting's attributes. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue. They want to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, red. The function modify_painting requires size, medium, and dominant_color. So I'll call modify_painting with size \"30x40\", medium \"oil\", and dominant_color \"red\". \n\nNext, predict the evolutionary rate for African elephants over 100 years using the Darwin model. The function prediction.evolution needs species and years. So species is \"African elephant\", years 100, model \"Darwin\". \n\nThen, calculate the probability of a royal flush. There are 4 favorable outcomes in 52 cards. The function calculate_probability requires total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, and round_to 3. So total_outcomes 52, favorable_outcomes 4, round_to 3. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. The painting modification has all required parameters. The evolution prediction has species and years, model is optional but specified. The probability calculation has all required parameters and the round_to is set to 3. All functions are called in order."}

The user has three main requests: predict the house price, find lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county, and calculate the probability of winning a lottery.\n\nFirst, for the house price prediction, the function predict_house_price is needed. The required parameters are area, rooms, year, and location. The user provided all these: area is 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, built in 1985, and location is San Francisco. So I can call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, the lawsuits. The function lawsuit_search requires entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and since the state isn't specified, it defaults to California. So I'll use those parameters.\n\nLastly, the probability calculation. The function calculate_probability needs total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes, with an optional round_to. The user specified 1000 total and 5 favorable, wanting it rounded to 3 decimals. So I'll set round_to=3 here.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. Each function's required fields are met. No missing parameters. Now, structure the tool calls accordingly."}

The user has four questions, so I need to handle each one in order.\n\nFirst, they want to know the collectable fish in Animal Crossing during Summer. The function get_collectables_in_season is needed here. Parameters are game_name: 'Animal Crossing', season: 'Summer', and item_type: 'fish'. That should get the list.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The game_score.highest function requires game: 'Fortnite', platform: 'Playstation', and region: 'Asia'. The region is specified, so include that.\n\nThird, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name: 'Apple Inc.' and year: 2018. They didn't mention case_type, so leave that out.\n\nLastly, binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, 0.7 probability.
