The URL should be the base endpoint without query parameters. The example given in the function's description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function which takes directed_by, genre, and cast as parameters. The user specified the director as James Gray, so I should set directed_by to \"James Gray\". They didn't mention genre or cast, so I'll use \"dontcare\" for those parameters to ensure they don't filter out any results. That should retrieve a list of movies directed by James Gray without restricting by genre or cast."}
