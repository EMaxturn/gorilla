But note the format: the function call expects a dict.\n\n However, the format we are using in the response is XML-like. We cannot nest complex types arbitrarily. We must represent the dictionary as a string? But the type for new_preferences is dict.\n\n But note the instruction: the type fields of the parameters must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n How to represent a dict? We can use a string in JSON format? But the function expects a dict. The tool that interprets the function call will have to parse the string as JSON? \n\n Alternatively, the system might handle the conversion. However, looking at the function definitions, the new_preferences is of type dict. But in the XML-like format, we can only have simple values? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"You should only return the function calls in your response\" and the format is as shown. The type of the parameter is dict, so we must pass a dict. But how?\n\n Since we are in an XML-like format, we might represent the dict as a string in JSON? But note that the function expects a dict. The system that runs the function might know how to parse it.\n\n Alternatively, we can break down the dict? But the function definition does not allow that. The function expects one parameter of type dict.\n\n We have to pass the entire dict as a string? But the type is dict. The system might require that we pass a string representation that can be evaluated? That is not safe.\n\n Let me look at the function definition again: \n   \"new_preferences\": { \"type\": \"dict\", ... }\n\n How would we represent a dict in the XML? We can use a string that is a JSON representation and set the type to \"dict\", but then the system must parse it.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact serialization. But note: the function call is being represented in XML. We cannot have nested elements because the format is:\n   <param name=\"...\" value=\"...\" type=\"...\"/>\n\n So we cannot have nested parameters for the dict. Therefore, we must pass the entire dict as a string? But then the type would be string? That's not what the function expects.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might allow for a different representation? But the instruction says: the type must be one of the listed, and dict is allowed.\n\n How about we pass the dict as a string in JSON format and set type to \"dict\"? But that would be ambiguous.\n\n After re-examining the problem: it says the type must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. But when the type is dict, how is the value represented? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n Given the constraints of the format, we have to pass the value as a string that represents the dictionary. For example:\n\n   value='{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\", \"special_instructions\": \"\"}'\n\n and type='dict'\n\n But note: the value attribute is a string. So we are effectively passing a string that the function implementation must parse as a dictionary? That's not ideal.\n\n Alternatively, the system might have a way to represent complex types? But the problem does not specify.\n\n However, looking at the function definitions, the new_preferences is a dict with properties. The function ChaDri.change_drink expects a dictionary. Since the format of the function call is limited, we have to pass the entire dictionary as a string and hope the system can parse it? Or perhaps we are allowed to represent it as a JSON string and mark the type as dict? That seems to be the only way.\n\n Alternatively, the function ChaDri.change_drink might be called by passing the dictionary as a string in JSON format? But the function expects a dict. The system that executes the function call will have to convert the string to a dict? \n\n Given the ambiguity, we have to make a decision. Since the problem states that the type is dict, we will pass the value as a string that is the JSON representation of the dictionary and set the type to dict. The system on the other end will parse it.\n\n Therefore, for the drink:\n\n   drink_id: \"123\" (type string)\n   new_preferences: \n        value: '{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\", \"special_instructions\": \"\"}'\n        type: dict\n\n But note: the value must be a string. So we are passing a string that is the JSON representation of the dictionary.\n\n Alternatively, we might use a different serialization? But JSON is standard.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the serialization. But since the function expects a dict, and we are passing a string, it might break.\n\n Let me re-read the function description: \n   \"new_preferences\": { \"type\": \"dict\", ... }\n\n How is this intended to be passed in the function call? The example format does not show a complex type.\n\n Given the instructions, I think we have to pass it as a string and set the type to dict. The system will then interpret the string as a JSON string and convert to a dict? Or maybe the system expects a Python dict string representation? That is not safe.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the function call representation does not support nested dicts? But the function definition includes a dict.\n\n Since we are stuck, we have to do the best we can. We'll represent the dict as a JSON string and set the type to dict.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the dict into multiple parameters? But that is not what the function expects. The function expects one parameter named new_preferences of type dict.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n   <param name=\"new_preferences\" value='{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\", \"special_instructions\": \"\"}' type=\"dict\"/>\n\n But note: the value must be in quotes. We are using single quotes for the XML attribute value, so the inner string must be double quoted. Also, we have to escape any quotes? But the inner string uses double quotes and we are wrapping in single quotes, so it should be okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes for the XML attribute and escape the inner double quotes? But the problem does not specify. Let's use single quotes for the outer and double inside.\n\n However, the problem does not specify how to escape. We'll assume the system can handle it.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   value=\"{&quot;size&quot;: &quot;large&quot;, ...}\"\n\n But that is messy.\n\n Given the constraints, I think the best is to use single quotes for the outer and double inside without escaping? But the XML specification says that inside an attribute value delimited by single quotes, we can have double quotes without escaping.\n\n So:\n\n   value='{\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\", \"special_instructions\": \"\"}'\n\n This should be acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes for the outer and escape the inner double quotes? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem says \"You should only return the function calls in your response\", and the format is XML-like, we'll assume that the system can parse the value appropriately.\n\n Let's write the function calls.\n\n However, note: the function ChaFod has a parameter 'removeIngredients' which we set to \"anchovies\". But what if there are multiple? The function expects a comma-separated string. So we are passing one item.\n\n For the drink, we are passing the entire dictionary as a string of a JSON object.\n\n We'll do two function calls.\n\n But note: the function name for the drink is \"ChaDri.change_drink\", but in the function list it's given as the 'name' in the json: 'ChaDri.change_drink'. So we use that full name.\n\n Now, write the response."}

The description says:\n   - Format: 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. \n   - For Paris, we have \"Paris, France\" (which is a country, so that's acceptable).\n   - For Letterkenny, Ireland: we use \"Letterkenny, Ireland\".\n\n Also, note that the function has parameters:\n   - location (required): string in the format above.\n   - category: optional, but we want 'Technology' for Letterkenny and default 'General' for Paris.\n   - language: optional, we want 'en' for both.\n\n We are to make two separate function calls, one for each location.\n\n However, note that the function call must be in the specified XML format.\n\n We cannot combine two locations in one call, so we will make two function calls.\n\n Let's structure:\n\n First call for Paris, France:\n   location: \"Paris, France\"\n   category: default is 'General' (so we can omit or specify as 'General')\n   language: 'en'\n\n Second call for Letterkenny, Ireland:\n   location: \"Letterkenny, Ireland\"\n   category: 'Technology'\n   language: 'en'\n\n But note: the function description says for location: \"If state not available use 'City, Country'\".

We are specifying the same as the default? \n However, the user specifically asked for technology for Letterkenny and for Paris no category was specified (so General is fine). \n Also, the language for both is English, which is the default? But the default for language is 'en'. So we could omit the language and category for Paris? \n However, the instruction says: if we decide to invoke, we must put in the format. And the function allows optional parameters. \n But the instruction also says: if the given question lacks the parameters, we should point it out? However, we are not lacking because the function has defaults.\n\n However, to be explicit and since the user requested English, we can include it.\n\n But note: the problem says we must output the function calls in the specified format. We are allowed to include optional parameters.\n\n We'll include all parameters to be explicit.\n\n Alternatively, we could omit the parameters that are set to their default? But the function definition says the default for category is 'General' and for language is 'en'. \n Since we want the default, we can omit? However, the format does not require to include optional parameters. But the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n Here, the function requires only the location. The rest are optional.\n\n But in the user request, for Paris the category is not specified -> we can use default. For Letterkenny, the category is specified as 'Technology'. \n The language is specified for both as English, which is the default. So we can omit the language? But the user explicitly said \"in English\", so including it is also acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n We have the required parameter (location) for both, so we are safe.\n\n We have two options: \n   Option 1: Only include the required parameters and the ones that are not default? \n   Option 2: Include all the parameters we are setting, even if they are the same as the default.\n\n The instruction does not specify. But note: the example format includes all parameters. Also, the function definition in the provided list includes the optional parameters.\n\n Since the user explicitly asked for English and for technology in one of them, we will include all.\n\n But note: the function `get_news_report` has an enum for category. We are using 'General' and 'Technology', both in the enum.\n\n So, let's write the function calls accordingly.\n\n Important: The type for each parameter must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, tuple. \n Here, all parameters are strings.\n\n We are going to output:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"get_news_report\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"location\" value=\"Paris, France\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"category\" value=\"General\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"language\" value=\"en\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"get_news_report\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"location\" value=\"Letterkenny, Ireland\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"category\" value=\"Technology\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"language\" value=\"en\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nHowever, note that the XML must be well-formed.

But note: the step does not explicitly require us to call `analyse_repo_contents` because the step says \"analyse the contents\", but we don't have a function that both analyses and then creates the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML. We must break it down.\n\n However, looking at the functions, we have:\n   - `analyse_repo_contents`: which returns the predominant language. But the step says \"analyse the contents\" and then create the files. The creation of Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML might depend on the analysis? But note the descriptions of the creation functions:\n        - `create_a_docker_file`: only takes a directory name. It doesn't take the language. So it must be that the function `create_a_docker_file` internally analyses the directory? Or it is designed to work without explicit language? The function description says: \"Generates a Dockerfile ... to enable containerization of the application.\" It does not specify that it does analysis. So we must rely on the step 2: we are to analyse and then create. But the step does not say we have to use the analysis result in the creation? It just says \"based on the analysis\", meaning we might have to do the analysis first and then use that information to create the files? However, the provided functions do not allow passing the analysis result to the Dockerfile creation. Therefore, we must assume that the `create_a_docker_file` function will do its own analysis? Or we have to do:\n\n        Actually, the step 2.1 says: \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\". So we are expected to do the analysis and then create the Dockerfile accordingly. But our function `create_a_docker_file` does not take the language as a parameter. So how can we use the analysis?\n\n        We have two options:\n        Option 1: The function `create_a_docker_file` might internally call the analysis? But the description doesn't say so.\n        Option 2: We are supposed to call `analyse_repo_contents` and then use the result to call a function that creates the Dockerfile? But there is no function that takes the language to create the Dockerfile.\n\n        Since we don't have a function that creates a Dockerfile with a language parameter, we must assume that `create_a_docker_file` does the analysis internally? Or maybe the step expects that we do the analysis and then conditionally create the Dockerfile? But we don't have conditional creation based on language? Actually, the step doesn't specify what to do if the language is not supported? We are only given these functions.\n\n        Given the constraints, we will proceed as follows:\n          - We will call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the predominant language? But note: the step says \"analyse the contents\", so we should call `analyse_repo_contents` and then use the result to decide the next steps? However, the step does not require us to change the creation based on the language? It just says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\", meaning the analysis is a prerequisite to know how to create the Dockerfile? But the function `create_a_docker_file` does not require the language. So we can skip explicitly calling `analyse_repo_contents` and rely on `create_a_docker_file` to do the right thing? Or we are required to do the analysis and then pass the result? We don't have a function that takes the language.\n\n        Let me reexamine the function list: there is no function that takes the language to create the Dockerfile. Therefore, we must assume that `create_a_docker_file` will do the analysis internally? Or the step might be broken.\n\n        Since we are constrained by the functions we have, we will do:\n          - Step 2.1: call `create_a_docker_file` with the directory name. We assume it will do the analysis internally? The description says: \"Generates a Dockerfile ... to enable containerization of the application.\" without mentioning analysis. But it must be that it does the analysis internally? Otherwise, how would it know?\n\n        Similarly, for step 2.2: `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` also does not take a language? So we can just call it with the directory name and the default parameters? But note: the step says \"based on the analysis\", so again we are relying on these functions to do the analysis? Or we are expected to do the analysis first and then use the result to set parameters? But we don't have parameters for language.\n\n        Therefore, we will skip explicitly calling `analyse_repo_contents` and rely on the creation functions to do the necessary analysis? Or note: the step 2 says \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\", meaning we must do the analysis? But what for? It doesn't specify that we have to use the result. So we can do:\n\n          Step 2: \n            - First, call `analyse_repo_contents` to get the language? But we don't have a function that uses that language? So it might be for our own information? But the step says \"based on the analysis\", so we must do the analysis? But we don't have a way to pass the result.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, and since the step does not specify that we have to conditionally create the files, we will do:\n\n          Step 2.1: call `create_a_docker_file` with the directory name.\n          Step 2.2: call `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` with the directory name and use default parameters for the rest? Because the step doesn't specify the deployment name, image name, replicas, port, or service type.\n\n        However, note that the step says \"create/update\", meaning if the file exists, update it? But the functions are named \"create\", but they might update? The descriptions say \"generates\", so we assume they will overwrite if exists? Or create if not exists? We don't know, but we must use the functions we have.\n\n Step 3: Add all changed files to git changes. But note: the function `push_git_changes_to_github` automatically adds all changes (according to its description: \"automatically git add all changes\"). So we don't need a separate step for adding.\n\n Step 4: Commit and push. We have the function `push_git_changes_to_github` for this.\n\n Therefore, we break down:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo with repo_url = \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\"\n   Step 2.1: create_a_docker_file with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\" (since we cloned without a destination, it will be in the current directory under the folder named after the repo)\n   Step 2.2: create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\", and use default for the rest? But note: the step does not specify any of the optional parameters, so we use the defaults.\n\n   Step 3: This is handled by the push function (it does git add all).\n\n   Step 4: push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name = \"nodejs-welcome\", and we must provide a commit message? The step says \"commit / push\", but doesn't specify the message. The function has a default for commit_message: \"Update changes\". We can use that. Also, the branch is default to \"main\", and force_push is false.\n\n However, note: the step 2.2 says \"kubernetes yamls\", plural, but the function `create_kubernetes_yaml_file` creates a single YAML file? We don't know, but we use the function.\n\n But wait: the step 2.1 and 2.2 require the directory name. We must know the name of the directory where the repo was cloned. Since we didn't specify a destination, the default is the current directory and the repo will be in a folder named by the last part of the URL without the .git? So \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n However, note: the URL is `git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git` -> the folder will be `nodejs-welcome`.\n\n But what if the destination was changed? We didn't change it, so we use \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\n Now, we must note: the function `clone_repo` returns nothing? So we assume it succeeds and the directory is created.\n\n We are going to call:\n\n   Step 1: clone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\", destination=\".\", recursive=False, depth=None) [but note: the default for destination is '.' and we are using that, so we don't need to specify? Actually, the function has a default for destination ('.') and for recursive (False) and depth (None). So we can just specify the repo_url.\n\n   Step 2.1: create_a_docker_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\")\n   Step 2.2: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\") -> using all defaults for the other parameters.\n\n   Step 4: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message=\"Update changes\", branch_name=\"main\", force_push=False) -> but we can omit the parameters that have defaults? However, in the XML format we must include only the ones we want to set? Actually, the function call format requires that we only include the parameters we are setting? But the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We are required to set the required parameters and can omit the optional ones that we want to use as default.\n\n   However, note: the function `push_git_changes_to_github` has a required parameter `directory_name`. We are setting that. The rest are optional and we are using the defaults.\n\n But the step 4 says \"commit / push to repo\", so we are pushing to the same repo we cloned? But we cloned from a URL that is using SSH (git@github.com:...). The push function will push to the remote that is already set? Since we just cloned, the remote is set. So it should work.\n\n However, note: the function `push_git_changes_to_github` does not take a remote name? It just pushes to the remote associated with the branch? So we assume it will push to 'origin'.\n\n Now, we must output the function calls in the required XML format.\n\n But note: we are to do multiple function calls? The problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" and we are to put all in one response? Actually, the example format shows multiple function calls in one <functions> block.\n\n So we will output:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"clone_repo\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"repo_url\" value=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"create_a_docker_file\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"create_kubernetes_yaml_file\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"push_git_changes_to_github\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"directory_name\" value=\"nodejs-welcome\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n However, note: the step 2 says \"analyse the contents\", but we did not call `analyse_repo_contents`? We are skipping it because the creation functions might do the analysis? Or because we don't have a way to use the result? The step says \"based on the analysis\", so we must do the analysis? But we don't have a function that uses the analysis result? So we have a problem.\n\n Let me reconsider: the step 2 is \"analyse the contents of the repo and create following\". It implies we must do the analysis and then create. But the creation functions do not take the analysis result. Therefore, we must do the analysis for the purpose of knowing what to do? But we are not given conditional steps. So we must do:\n\n   Step 2: call `analyse_repo_contents` and then based on the result, we might call different functions? But we don't have conditional functions? We are constrained by the functions we have.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the analysis is done by the creation functions? Then we don't need to do it separately? The step might be interpreted as: \"analyse (by creating the dockerfile and kubernetes yamls, which internally do analysis)\".\n\n But the step says \"analyse the contents ... and create following\", which suggests two separate actions: first analyse, then create. However, without a way to pass the analysis result, we cannot conditionally create. So we must do the analysis and then ignore the result? That seems odd.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the step does not specify what to do with the analysis result, and the creation functions do not require the result, we will omit the explicit call to `analyse_repo_contents`. We assume that the creation functions will do the necessary analysis.\n\n Alternatively, if we are required to do the analysis step, we can do:\n\n   Step 2: call `analyse_repo_contents` with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\", and then we do nothing with the result? Then proceed to create the files? That satisfies the step? But the step says \"based on the analysis\", so we are not using the result? That is inconsistent.\n\n Since we cannot use the result, we decide to skip the explicit analysis step and rely on the creation functions to do the analysis.\n\n Therefore, we stick to the plan without the analysis function call.\n\n But note: the function `create_a_docker_file` might require the analysis? It doesn't say in the description. We are taking a risk. But we have no alternative.\n\n So the final set of function calls is as above.\n\n However, one more point: the step 2.1 says \"create/update\", meaning if a Dockerfile exists, we update it? The function `create_a_docker_file` might overwrite an existing Dockerfile? We assume that is the intended behavior.\n\n We are ready to output."}
