The functions provided include 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Let me check the parameters for that function. The function requires distance and time, which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed has a default of 0, so even if it's not specified, it's okay.

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same gas at different temperatures. The problem states 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing gases, especially if they're the same, the final temperature can be found using the formula based on conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. Since they're the same gas, the specific heat capacity should be the same for both, so it might cancel out.\n\nWait, the formula for the final temperature when mixing two quantities of the same substance is (quantity1 * temp1 + quantity2 * temp2) divided by the total quantity. So like (n1*T1 + n2*T2)/(n1 + n2). Let me check if that's correct. Yeah, because the total internal energy is conserved. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature and quantity. So adding the internal energies and dividing by total quantity gives the final temperature.\n\nSo in this case, quantity1 is 2 moles, temp1 is 300 K, quantity2 is 3 moles, temp2 is 400 K. Plugging into the formula: (2*300 + 3*400)/(2+3) = (600 + 1200)/5 = 1800/5 = 360 K. So the final temperature should be 360 K.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. So I need to call that function with the given values. The parameters are all integers, which matches the input. So the function call should include those four parameters with the respective values. The molar mass isn't needed here since the function doesn't require it. So the correct tool call is to use calculate_final_temperature with the provided quantities and temperatures."}

The user mentioned a roll of two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default for sides_per_die is probably 6, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the problem says \"a roll of two dice\" without mentioning different sides. So I can assume standard dice with 6 sides each. So sides_per_die is 6. \n\nThe desired_sum is 7. So the function call should have desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, and sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the function's parameters have defaults? Let me check the function definition again. The parameters are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int) with default 1, and sides_per_die (int). Wait, the default for n_rolls is 1? But the user is rolling two dice, so n_rolls should be 2.
