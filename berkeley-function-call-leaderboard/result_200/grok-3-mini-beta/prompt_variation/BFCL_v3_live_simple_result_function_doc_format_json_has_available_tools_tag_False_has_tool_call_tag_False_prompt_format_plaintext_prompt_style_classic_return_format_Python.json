'unit' is optional, but the user specified it.\n\nOnce I make this function call, that should fulfill the user's request. The system will handle the response after this.\n\nMy response should be solely: [get_current_weather(location='Shanghai, China', unit='celsius')]\n\nMake sure the format is precise: It's in square brackets, with the function name and parameters in parentheses, separated by commas if needed."}

So, I should use 'no onions,extra cheese' without the space.\n\nThe description: \"separate using comma with no space between comma\" \u2013 it's a bit unclear, but I believe it means to separate items with commas and no spaces, like \"a,b,c\".\n\nTo be precise, I'll format it as: 'no onions,extra cheese'\n\nNow, is this the only function I need?

It calculates the sum of all numbers provided in a list. The parameters require a 'numbers_list', which is an array of floating-point numbers.\n\nThe question involves summing two numbers: 133 and 34. I can put these into a list and pass it to the function.\n\nThe function expects a list of floats, so I need to convert these integers to floats or ensure they are treated as such.\n\nIn Python, integers can be summed as floats, but the description specifies 'items': {'type': 'float'}, so I should provide them as floats.\n\nTo use this function, I need to call it with: sum_numbers(numbers_list=[133, 34])\n\nBut the items should be floats, so better to use: numbers_list=[133.0, 34.0]\n\nMy response should only include the function call in the specified format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this, it would be: [sum_numbers(numbers_list=[133.0, 34.0])]\n\nThat seems straightforward. I don't need to call any other functions.\n\nOnce I make this call, the system will execute it and provide the result in the next turn, I assume.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nIn this case, calling sum_numbers should fulfill the request, as it will compute the sum.\n\nI think that's it for this turn.\n\nThe question doesn't lack any parameters; I have the numbers needed.\n\nSo, my response should be just: [sum_numbers(numbers_list=[133.0, 34.0])]"}

They've provided details like version, IP, API name, and various parameters.\n\nI have only one function available: 'requests.get'. This is for sending a GET request to a network telemetry API.\n\nLet me check the function's description: It's for sending a GET request to retrieve specified information for an interface from a network telemetry API. The URL should be something like 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nThe user has given an IP: 192.120.45.67, and parameters like fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType.\n\nThe function requires 'url' and 'params'. The 'url' should be the base path without query parameters, and 'params' is a dictionary of query parameters.\n\nFrom the function's parameters:\n\n- url: e.g., 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\n- params: a dict with keys like fabricName, nodeId, etc.\n\nThe user specified:\n\n- Parameter_fabricName: Network1\n\n- Parameter_nodeId: 12\n\n- Parameter_podId: 10\n\n- Parameter_interfaceType: Ethernet\n\n- Parameter_infoType: Speed\n\nI need to map these to the function's params.\n\nIn the function's params properties:\n\n- fabricName: string\n\n- nodeId: integer\n\n- podId: integer\n\n- interfaceType: string, with enum ['gigabitethernet', 'fastethernet', 'ethernet', 'serial']\n\n'Ethernet' is not exactly in the enum. The enum has 'ethernet', which might be a match (case-sensitive? Probably not, but it's lowercase in the enum).\n\n- infoType: string, with enum ['statistics', 'status', 'config', 'Speed']\n\n'Speed' is in the enum, capitalized.\n\nSo, all parameters seem to match.\n\nNow, for the URL: It should be based on the IP. The example is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\nThe user mentioned the API name: \"get information of an interface\", which aligns with this.\n\nI need to construct the URL using the provided IP: 192.120.45.67\n\nSo, url = 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\nAnd params = {\n\n    'fabricName': 'Network1',\n\n    'nodeId': 12,  # This is an integer\n\n    'podId': 10,   # Integer\n\n    'interfaceType': 'Ethernet',  # But enum has 'ethernet' \u2013 I should use lowercase as per enum? The description says 'ethernet', but user said 'Ethernet'. I'll use what the user provided, assuming it's case-insensitive.\n\n    'infoType': 'Speed'\n\n}\n\nIn the function's parameters, interfaceType enum is ['gigabitethernet', 'fastethernet', 'ethernet', 'serial'], all lowercase. I should probably convert 'Ethernet' to 'ethernet' to match.\n\nBut the function call should use the value as is, and let the API handle it. To be precise, I'll use 'ethernet' based on the enum.\n\nThe user said 'Ethernet', but the enum is 'ethernet'. I should correct it or use exactly as in enum. In my response, I have to use the values from the user's input unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls\". I should use the provided values.\n\nTo make it work, I'll assume we need to match the enum. But for now, I'll use 'ethernet' as it's likely a typo.\n\nIn the user's message: \"Parameter_interfaceType: Ethernet\" and enum has 'ethernet'. I'll proceed with 'ethernet'.\n\nSimilarly for infoType: 'Speed' matches the enum.\n\nSo, I can make a function call to 'requests.get' with:\n\n- url: 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'\n\n- params: {'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'}\n\nThe user wrote 'Ethernet', but I'll adjust to 'ethernet' for correctness.\n\nIn the response format, I need to output exactly: [requests.get(url='https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', params={'fabricName': 'Network1', 'nodeId': 12, 'podId': 10, 'interfaceType': 'ethernet', 'infoType': 'Speed'})]\n\nThe format specified: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nYes.\n\nIs this the only function call needed? Yes, as this directly addresses the user's request.\n\nThe user asked: \"How to generate a RESTful API request\", but I'm supposed to make the function call, which will perform the request.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\"\n\nSo, I should just output the function call.\n\nFinally, ensure the response is only the function call in the specified format."}

Assuming it's DD/MM/YYYY as per the context (e.g., 12/03/2024 might be 12th March 2024), but to be safe, I'll use the format as is.
