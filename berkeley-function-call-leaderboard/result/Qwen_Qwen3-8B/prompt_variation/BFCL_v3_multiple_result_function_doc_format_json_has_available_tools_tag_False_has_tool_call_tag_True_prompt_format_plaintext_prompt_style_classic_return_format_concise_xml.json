The user is asking to calculate the displacement of a car. The car has an initial speed of 20 m/s and accelerates at 10 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. They mentioned it's straight-line motion, so I should use the kinematics function for displacement.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_displacement' which requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The parameters are all integers except maybe acceleration and time, but the function expects integers. Wait, the parameters for 'calculate_displacement' have initial_speed, acceleration, and time as integers. The user provided 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. All are integers, so that's good. The rounding is optional with a default of 2 decimals. Since the user didn't specify, I can leave it out or set it to 2. \n\nSo I need to call calculate_displacement with initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. The formula used in the function is probably s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Let me check the parameters again. Yes, the required ones are there. No missing parameters. So the function call should be straightforward. I don't need to use the other function because the question is about displacement, not final speed. Alright, I'll structure the tool call with those parameters."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified the US, I don't need to adjust the region. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. \n\nWait, but the question mentions \"cheapest\". Does the function return the lowest price or the current price? The description says \"selling price\", which might just be the current price. However, since there's no other function that checks sales or discounts, maybe the store_price function will return the discounted price if it's on sale. The user might be implying that the cheapest price is the sale price. \n\nAlternatively, there's the video_games.on_sale function to check if it's on sale. But the user isn't asking if it's on sale, but rather the cheapest price. So maybe I should first check if it's on sale using on_sale, and if it is, then get the price from store_price. But the user is asking for the cheapest, which could be the sale price. However, the functions available don't have a way to compare prices over time or different sales. \n\nGiven the functions provided, the best approach is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region. That should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available unless there's a sale. But since the user didn't mention checking sales, maybe the store_price function is sufficient. \n\nWait, the on_sale function can check if it's on sale. If it is, then the store_price would return the sale price. So maybe the user wants to confirm if it's on sale and then get the price. But the question is straightforward: the cheapest selling price. So the store_price function should return the current price, which might be the lowest. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is video_games.store_price with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', and region 'United States'. The region is optional and defaults to US, but since the user specified it, we include it. \n\nNo other functions are needed. The on_sale function isn't necessary here unless the user wants to know if it's currently discounted, but the question is about the price, not the sale status. So the answer is to call store_price with the given parameters."}

The second is calculate_speed_from_rest, which requires distance and time, and initial_speed is optional with a default of 0. \n\nSince the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The question is asking for the final speed. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest.

The user provided distance as 20 meters and time as 4 seconds. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (default 0).

All the required parameters are provided in the question: 2 moles and 300 K for the first, 3 moles and 400 K for the second. So I should call that function with these values.
