So we can pass:\n   movie = [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time = [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n But note: the function description says it finds local movie theatres and their schedule for a specific movie. \n It seems to be designed to handle multiple movies and their corresponding times.\n\n However, the requirement says: \"Find two movie theatres\" that have availability for:\n   - Tenet at 5 pm\n   - No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\n\n The function does not specify that it returns exactly two theatres, but we can call it and then in the response we can pick two.\n\n But note: the function does not have a parameter to limit the number of theatres. We are to return the function call as required.\n\n Important: The function requires all three parameters: location, movie, and time.\n\n We have:\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: an array of two movies: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: an array of two times: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n However, note that the function might interpret the arrays as: for each movie, we are providing a time? \n But the description says: \"Find ... for a specific movie\". It might be that the function expects one movie and one time? \n But the parameters are arrays. \n\n Looking at the parameters:\n   - movie: array of string (with enum) -> meaning we can pass multiple movies?\n   - time: array of string -> meaning we can pass multiple times?\n\n The function description says \"for a specific movie\" (singular) but the parameters are arrays. \n\n Since the function is not well documented, we have to assume that the arrays are for multiple movies and multiple times. \n And the intended use is to search for multiple movies at multiple times? \n\n But note: the question asks for two separate movies at two different times. We can pass both.\n\n However, the requirement says: \"Find two movie theatres\" that have both showings? Or one theatre that has both? \n The question: \"Find two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\"\n\n This could be interpreted as:\n   Option 1: Find two theatres such that one theatre has Tenet at 5 pm and another theatre has No Time To Die at 7:30 pm? \n   Option 2: Find two theatres that each have both showings?\n\n The question does not specify. But note the conjunction \"and\": it might be that we are looking for theatres that have both showings? \n However, the requirement says \"two movie theatres\", so it might be two separate theatres.\n\n But the function call as designed might return theatres that have at least one of the showings? \n\n Since the function is not clear, we will call it with both movies and both times and then in the result we can look for two theatres that together cover both showings? \n But note: the system will run the function and then we can process the result in the next step? \n\n However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" \n And we are only allowed to output function calls until we have fulfilled the request.\n\n Since we are limited to one function call per tool call, and we have one function, we call it once.\n\n We are to find two theatres. The function might return more than two. We can then in the next step (if we are allowed) process the results to pick two.\n\n But note: the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" \n And then the system will consider the turn complete when we have no more functions to call.\n\n Since we have only one function and we are calling it once, we will output the function call.\n\n However, the function requires the parameters. We have all the required parameters.\n\n Let's form the call:\n\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n But note: the function expects the time array to have the same length as the movie array? Because each movie has a time? \n We are providing two movies and two times. \n\n But what if the function expects one time per movie? That seems to be the case.\n\n So we call:\n\n   find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"])\n\n However, the problem: the function might return theatres that have Tenet at 5 pm OR No Time To Die at 7:30 pm? \n But we want theatres that have both? Or we want two theatres: one for each? \n\n The question is ambiguous. But note: the function does not have a parameter to specify that we want both showings in the same theatre.\n\n Since we cannot change the function, we call it with the two movies and two times and then in the next step (if we are allowed to do more processing) we can filter.\n\n But the instruction says: we are to output function calls until we have fulfilled the request. And we are only allowed to output function calls.\n\n We have only one function, so we call it and then the turn ends. The system will run the function and then we will get the result.\n\n Then in the next turn, we can process the result? But note: the instruction says we are to output the function call in the specified format and then the system will run it and then the next turn we can see the result.\n\n However, the current instruction is to output the function call for this turn.\n\n So we output:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n   <function name=\"find_movie_showing\">\n     <param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">San Diego, CA</param>\n     <param name=\"movie\" type=\"array\">['Tenet', 'No Time To Die']</param>\n     <param name=\"time\" type=\"array\">['5 pm', '7:30 pm']</param>\n   </function>\n   </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the type for the array parameters. We are passing an array of strings. The function expects:\n   - movie: array of string (with enum) -> so we are passing an array of two strings.\n   - time: array of string -> we are passing an array of two strings.\n\n However, the XML format requires that we represent the array in a way that is valid. We cannot use Python list representation? \n But note the instruction says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n How to represent an array in the XML? We can use a string representation? But the system that runs the function will parse it.\n\n Since the function is in Python, we can use the Python list representation? But the tool that parses the XML might not be Python.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent each element individually? But the function expects an array.\n\n The instruction does not specify the exact serialization. But note that the example in the instruction does not show an array.\n\n However, the function definition says the type is array. We must represent it as an array.\n\n We can use a comma-separated string? But that would be a string, not an array.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a JSON string? But the type is array, so the tool should be able to parse an array.\n\n Since the system is designed to handle these types, we can use:\n\n   <param name=\"movie\" type=\"array\">[\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]</param>\n\n But note: the XML might require escaping. However, the values do not have special characters.\n\n Similarly for time: <param name=\"time\" type=\"array\">[\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]</param>\n\n But wait: the function expects the time as an array of strings. We are providing two times. \n\n However, the function might require the times to be in a specific format? The description doesn't specify. We use the format given: \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\".\n\n But note: the function might not understand \"5 pm\" and might require \"17:00\". However, we are not told, so we use the user's format.\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly.\n\n However, note: the function's enum for movie only includes \"Tenet\" and \"No Time To Die\", so we are safe.\n\n But the function requires the parameters. We have provided all required parameters.\n\n So we write:"}

HCF of (72, 96)\n\nThe results from these will be used in the next turn to compute:\n- HCF of the result from (45,60) and the result from (90,120)\n- HCF of the result from (36,48) and the result from (72,96)\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n<function name=\"math.hcf\">\n<param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">45</param>\n<param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">60</param>\n</function>\n<function name=\"math.hcf\">\n<param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">90</param>\n<param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">120</param>\n</function>\n<function name=\"math.hcf\">\n<param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">36</param>\n<param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">48</param>\n</function>\n<function name=\"math.hcf\">\n<param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">72</param>\n<param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">96</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>", "input_token_count": 490, "output_token_count": 4316, "latency": 210.1754117012024, "reasoning_content": "We are given two main tasks. Let's break them down.\n\n Task 1:\n   Step 1: Find the highest common factor (HCF) of (45, 60). Let this result be R1.\n   Step 2: Then find the HCF of (90, 120) and let this result be R2.\n   Step 3: Then find the HCF of R1 and R2? But note the question says: \"use that result (R1) to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". This is ambiguous.\n\n However, reading carefully: \n   \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\"\n\n It might mean:\n   Step 1: HCF(45,60) = R1\n   Step 2: Then we are to compute HCF(R1, 90, 120) ? But our function only takes two numbers.\n\n Alternatively, it might mean:\n   Step 1: HCF(45,60) = R1\n   Step 2: Compute HCF(90,120) = R2\n   Step 3: Then compute HCF(R1, R2)\n\n But note the question says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair\". This phrasing is unclear.\n\n However, the function we have only takes two numbers. Therefore, we must break it down:\n\n   - First, we compute HCF(45,60) -> R1\n   - Then, we compute HCF(90,120) -> R2\n   - Then, we compute HCF(R1, R2) -> R3\n\n Similarly, the second task:\n\n   Step 1: HCF(36,48) = R4\n   Step 2: HCF(72,96) = R5\n   Step 3: Then compute HCF(R4, R5) = R6\n\n But note: the question says \"then find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72,96)\" - this is also ambiguous.\n\n However, we can interpret:\n\n   Step 1: HCF(36,48) = R4\n   Step 2: Then we are to compute HCF(R4, 72, 96)? Again, we can only take two at a time.\n\n So we do:\n\n   Step 1: HCF(36,48) = R4\n   Step 2: Compute HCF(72,96) = R5\n   Step 3: Then compute HCF(R4, R5) = R6\n\n Therefore, we need to make multiple function calls:\n\n   Call 1: math.hcf(45,60) -> result1\n   Call 2: math.hcf(90,120) -> result2\n   Call 3: math.hcf(result1, result2) -> final_result1\n\n   Call 4: math.hcf(36,48) -> result3\n   Call 5: math.hcf(72,96) -> result4\n   Call 6: math.hcf(result3, result4) -> final_result2\n\n However, note that the function only takes two numbers. Therefore, we cannot pass three numbers at once.\n\n But the problem is that we cannot chain the function calls arbitrarily because the function only takes two numbers. We have to break the problem into two-number steps.\n\n Since the tool only allows two numbers at a time, we have to compute:\n\n   For the first chain:\n      Step1: HCF(45,60) -> R1\n      Step2: HCF(90,120) -> R2\n      Step3: HCF(R1, R2) -> R3\n\n   For the second chain:\n      Step4: HCF(36,48) -> R4\n      Step5: HCF(72,96) -> R5\n      Step6: HCF(R4, R5) -> R6\n\n However, note that the function 'math.hcf' can actually take more than two numbers? But the provided function signature only has two parameters. Therefore, we must do it step by step.\n\n But the problem: the tool call function only has two parameters. So we must break the problem accordingly.\n\n We are allowed to make multiple tool calls. So we can do:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n      <functions>\n        <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">45</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">60</param></function>\n      </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n Then we get a result, say R1.\n\n Then we can do:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n      <functions>\n        <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">90</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">120</param></function>\n      </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n Then we get R2.\n\n Then we do:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n      <functions>\n        <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">R1</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">R2</param></function>\n      </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n Similarly for the second chain.\n\n However, the system expects that in one turn we output all the function calls we want to make? But note the instruction says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". So we can output multiple function calls in one go? But the example format allows multiple <function> tags inside one <TOOLCALL> block? Actually, the format is:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n      <functions>\n        ... multiple function elements ...\n      </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n But note: the system will execute the functions in the order given? And we can use the results of previous functions in the same block? Actually, no. Because we don't have a way to refer to the results of previous function calls in the same block. Therefore, we must break the process into multiple turns? However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until ...\".\n\n Since we are in one turn, we can only output the first step? But then the next turn we get the result and then output the next? But the problem is that the user expects one response.\n\n Alternatively, the system might support multiple independent function calls in one block? But note: the functions are independent if they don't depend on each other's output. In our case:\n\n   The first two calls (for 45,60 and 90,120) are independent. Then the third call depends on the results of the first two.\n\n   Similarly, the next two (36,48 and 72,96) are independent, and then the sixth depends on the fourth and fifth.\n\n But the problem is that we don't have the results of the first two when we are making the third call. Therefore, we cannot do it in one block.\n\n How about we break the entire process into multiple blocks? But the instruction says we can output multiple function calls until we have fulfilled the request. However, we cannot use the results of previous calls in the same block.\n\n Therefore, we must do:\n\n   First block: \n        call1: (45,60) -> we get R1\n        call2: (90,120) -> we get R2\n\n   Then in the next block, we can do:\n        call3: (R1, R2)\n\n   Then next block:\n        call4: (36,48) -> R3\n        call5: (72,96) -> R4\n\n   Then next block:\n        call6: (R3, R4)\n\n But the problem is that the user expects one response? Actually, the system is designed for multiple turns. We are to output one block of function calls per turn.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and we can output multiple independent function calls in one turn.\n\n But note: the third call depends on the results of the first two. Therefore, we cannot include the third call in the same turn as the first two because we don't have the results yet.\n\n So we must do:\n\n   Turn 1: \n        We output the first two independent calls (for the first chain) and the next two independent calls (for the second chain) are also independent of the first chain? Actually, we can compute both chains independently? But the third call of the first chain depends on the first two of the first chain, and similarly the sixth call of the second chain depends on the fourth and fifth.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n        Turn 1: \n            Call1: (45,60)\n            Call2: (90,120)\n            Call3: (36,48)\n            Call4: (72,96)\n\n        Why? Because these four are independent. Then we get four results.\n\n        Turn 2:\n            Then we do:\n                Call5: (result1, result2)   [for the first chain]\n                Call6: (result3, result4)   [for the second chain]\n\n   But note: the instruction says \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL> ...\". And we can put multiple function calls in one TOOLCALL block? Yes, the example shows multiple function tags.\n\n   However, the system might run them in parallel and we don't know the order? But the functions are independent. But the problem is that the third call of the first chain requires the results of the first two. Similarly, the sixth requires the results of the fourth and fifth.\n\n   But if we put four calls in one block, we get four results. Then we can use them in the next block.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break into two blocks:\n\n        Block 1: \n            function1: (45,60)\n            function2: (90,120)\n            function3: (36,48)\n            function4: (72,96)\n\n        Then we get results for all.\n\n        Block 2:\n            function5: (result1, result2)   [for the first chain: HCF of the two results from the first chain]\n            function6: (result3, result4)   [for the second chain]\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the function names must be exactly as given. We have only one function: math.hcf.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>\n          <functions>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">45</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">60</param></function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">90</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">120</param></function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">36</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">48</param></function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">72</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">96</param></function>\n          </functions>\n        </TOOLCALL>\n\n   Then in the next turn, we will have the results for these four. Let the results be:\n\n        result1 = HCF(45,60)\n        result2 = HCF(90,120)\n        result3 = HCF(36,48)\n        result4 = HCF(72,96)\n\n   Then we can do:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>\n          <functions>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">result1</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">result2</param></function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">result3</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">result4</param></function>\n          </functions>\n        </TOOLCALL>\n\n   But note: we must use the actual integer values of the results. However, we don't know the results until we run the first block.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot put the second block until we have the results.\n\n   The system is designed to handle multiple turns. So we will do:\n\n        Turn 1: output the first block of four independent calls.\n\n        Then the system will run and return the results.\n\n        Then Turn 2: we output the second block of two calls, using the results from the first block.\n\n   However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until ...\". So we are allowed to use multiple turns.\n\n   But the problem: the user's request is given in one message. We are to break it into two turns.\n\n   However, the instruction does not require to do everything in one turn. So we can break it.\n\n   But note: the example format only allows one TOOLCALL block per turn? And the turn ends when we output the TOOLCALL block? Then the system will run the functions and return the results, and then we get a new turn.\n\n   Therefore, we are going to do:\n\n        Turn 1: \n            We output the first TOOLCALL block with the four function calls.\n\n        Then the system will run and return four results: r1, r2, r3, r4.\n\n        Then we are in Turn 2: we output the second TOOLCALL block with two function calls: \n            math.hcf(r1, r2) and math.hcf(r3, r4)\n\n   However, the system will not know which result corresponds to which call? Actually, the system will return the results in the same order as the function calls.\n\n   But the problem: we are required to output the function calls in the format. We don't have the actual values for r1, r2, etc. until the first block is executed.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot write the second block in the first turn. We must wait until we have the results.\n\n   How does the system work? \n\n        We are only to output the function calls for the current turn. The system will then execute and give us the results in the next turn.\n\n   So in the first turn, we can only output the first block. Then in the next turn (after we receive the results), we output the second block.\n\n   But the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" - in the first block, we have all the parameters. So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, we will do:\n\n        First turn: \n            <TOOLCALL>\n                <functions>\n                    ... the four function calls for (45,60), (90,120), (36,48), (72,96) ...\n                </functions>\n            </TOOLCALL>\n\n        Then the system runs and returns the four results.\n\n        Second turn:\n            We have the results. Then we output:\n            <TOOLCALL>\n                <functions>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">[value of result1]</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">[value of result2]</param></function>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\"><param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">[value of result3]</param><param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">[value of result4]</param></function>\n                </functions>\n            </TOOLCALL>\n\n   But note: we are in the first turn now. We don't know the results. Therefore, we cannot output the second block in the first turn.\n\n   So we must only output the first block in the first turn.\n\n   Therefore, the response for the first turn should be:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>\n          <functions>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n              <param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">45</param>\n              <param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">60</param>\n            </function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n              <param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">90</param>\n              <param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">120</param>\n            </function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n              <param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">36</param>\n              <param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">48</param>\n            </function>\n            <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n              <param name=\"number1\" type=\"integer\">72</param>\n              <param name=\"number2\" type=\"integer\">96</param>\n            </function>\n          </functions>\n        </TOOLCALL>\n\n   Then the system will run these and return the results. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to compute the final two.\n\n   However, note that the instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL> ...\". And we are only allowed to output the TOOLCALL block. So we do exactly that.\n\n   But wait: the user might not want to wait for two turns? However, the system is designed for multiple turns.\n\n   Alternatively, if we are allowed to do the entire process in one turn by using the function multiple times and then using the results in the same turn? But the tool call format does not allow using the output of one function as input to another in the same block. Therefore, we must break.\n\n   Therefore, we output the first block of four calls.\n\n   Note: the system will run all four in parallel? But that's acceptable because they are independent.\n\n   Then in the next turn, we will have the results and then we can output the next block.\n\n   So for the first turn, we output:\n\n        [The TOOLCALL block with the four function calls as above]\n\n   And then we stop.\n\n   We do not output the second block until the next turn.\n\n   Therefore, the answer for this turn is only the first block.\n\n   We do not know the results of the first block until the next turn, so we cannot compute the second block now.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let's write the TOOLCALL block for the first turn."}

We are providing kg.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The chemist repeats the experiment with the same substance, but this time the initial temperature is 10 degrees Celsius and the final temperature is 50 degrees Celsius.\" So we have two sets.\n\n We are to return two function calls in the same <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n But note: the function call format allows multiple function elements within the <functions> tag.\n\n Let's write the two calls:\n\n First function call for experiment 1:\n   name: entropy_change.calculate\n   parameters:\n      substance: \"A\"\n      mass: 2\n      initial_temperature: 25\n      final_temperature: 75\n\n Second function call for experiment 2:\n   name: entropy_change.calculate\n   parameters:\n      substance: \"A\"\n      mass: 2\n      initial_temperature: 10\n      final_temperature: 50\n\n We omit pressure because it is the same as the default (1 atm) and the function has a default.\n\n However, note: the function expects the temperatures in \u00b0C and we are providing them as integers.\n\n We are not told any other parameters, so we assume the function can handle substance A.\n\n Let's write the XML accordingly."}

A detailed description of the structure and functioning of a neuron cell.\n 2. A less detailed description of a muscle cell.\n\n We have one function available: biology.get_cell_info\n The function takes:\n   - cell_type (string, required): the type of cell\n   - detailed (boolean, default false): whether to get a detailed description\n\n For the neuron cell, we want detailed = true.\n For the muscle cell, we want detailed = false (which is the default).\n\n However, note that the function only returns information about one cell at a time.\n Therefore, we need to make two separate function calls.\n\n Steps:\n 1. First call: get detailed info for neuron cell.\n    - cell_type: \"neuron\"\n    - detailed: true\n\n 2. Second call: get less detailed (default) info for muscle cell.\n    - cell_type: \"muscle cell\" (or perhaps more specifically, but the question says \"muscle cell in the human body\")\n    - detailed: we can omit because the default is false, or set to false.\n\n But note: the function expects a cell type. We must be cautious about the exact string.\n\n However, the function description does not specify exact names. We have to use our best judgment.\n\n For muscle cell, we can use \"muscle cell\" or perhaps more specific? But the question says \"muscle cell\", so we'll use that.\n\n We'll make two tool calls in one <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n Important: The output must be in the exact XML format.\n\n Let's write the function calls:\n\n First function:\n   name: biology.get_cell_info\n   params:\n      cell_type (string): \"neuron\"\n      detailed (boolean): true\n\n Second function:\n   name: biology.get_cell_info\n   params:\n      cell_type (string): \"muscle cell\"\n      detailed (boolean): false   (or we could omit because default is false? But the function allows to set. To be explicit, we set to false)\n\n However, note that the function has a default for detailed (false). We are allowed to omit it? But the problem says: \n   \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\n We are not lacking any required parameters. We have cell_type for both.\n\n But the instruction says: we should only include parameters that are required or that we want to set. Since for the muscle cell we want non-detailed, and the default is non-detailed, we can omit.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" - but we are not lacking because the default will be used.\n\n But to be explicit and clear, we can set detailed=false for the muscle cell. Alternatively, we can omit.\n\n How should we decide? The function definition says the default is false. So omitting detailed for muscle cell would be acceptable.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: ...\". We are going to include only the required parameters? Or we can include optional ones? The function call format allows optional parameters.\n\n Since the user asked for \"less detailed\" for muscle cell, we can set detailed=false to be explicit.\n\n But note: the function call format does not require optional parameters. We can omit.\n\n However, to avoid any ambiguity, I will include detailed for both.\n\n So:\n\n First call: \n   <function name=\"biology.get_cell_info\">\n      <param name=\"cell_type\" type=\"string\">neuron</param>\n      <param name=\"detailed\" type=\"boolean\">true</param>\n   </function>\n\n Second call:\n   <function name=\"biology.get_cell_info\">\n      <param name=\"cell_type\" type=\"string\">muscle cell</param>\n      <param name=\"detailed\" type=\"boolean\">false</param>\n   </function>\n\n Alternatively, we could omit detailed for the second. But to be safe and explicit, we set it.\n\n Let's write the XML accordingly."}
