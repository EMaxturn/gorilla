For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nIt says: \"the command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas.\"\n\nExamples:\n\n- '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room\n\n- ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589' for activating cooling without specifying the room\n\n- '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine in the utility room\n\nThe user has two commands in one sentence. I need to handle both.\n\nThe function takes a single \"command\" parameter, which is a string. So, I might need to make separate calls for each command.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can make multiple function calls in one response by including them in the JSON array.\n\nIn the format: <TOOLCALL>```json [{\"function\":\"func_name1\",...}, {\"function\":\"func_name2\",...}] ```</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I should call \"ControlAppliance.execute\" twice: once for each command.\n\nFirst command: \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\"\n\nThe example uses \"\uc2e4\ud589\" for turning on, which matches.\n\nSecond command: \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\"\n\nThat seems to fit.\n\nThe description says: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'.\" But in the params, it shows examples with \"\uc2e4\ud589\" and \"\uc911\uc9c0\", which are Korean for \"execute/start\" and \"stop\".\n\nThe description might be a bit misleading, but the params specify Korean strings.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, I need to make two function calls:\n\n1.

So, it's not relevant here.\n\nThe user's request involves two skills, but the function only supports one. I need to handle this by making function calls that I can. Perhaps I should call the function for each skill separately.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the function requires a skill, and the user provided skills, but multiple ones.\n\nI have to respond with function calls in the specified format or point out if none can be used.

I should chain them if necessary, but in one response, I can include multiple function calls.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL>```json [array of function calls]```</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can include multiple functions in one array.\n\nHowever, some functions depend on the output of previous ones. For example, analyse_repo_contents might be needed before creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files. But the functions don't explicitly take outputs from previous ones; I just need to call them in sequence.\n\nIn this setup, I have to assume that the system will handle the sequence, so I should output all necessary calls in order.\n\nThe user says \"based on the analysis\", but the functions like create_a_docker_file don't take analysis as input; they just take directory_name. So, I'll proceed by calling them after analysis.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 3.\n\nI need to specify parameters:\n\n- For clone_repo: repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. I can omit other params if not needed.\n\n- For analyse_repo_contents: directory_name \u2013 after cloning, what is the directory name? If I don't specify destination in clone_repo, it clones to the current directory, probably with the repo name. Let's assume it's the repo name, like 'nodejs-welcome'. I need to use that.\n\nIn clone_repo, if destination is not provided, it clones to the current working directory, but the function description says: \"If omitted, the repository is cloned into the current working directory.\" It might create a subdirectory with the repo name. To be safe, I should specify a destination.\n\nThe function allows destination as optional. For consistency, I can specify it, say 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, for other functions, use that directory_name.\n\nSo, let's plan the calls:\n\n1. First function: clone_repo with repo_url and perhaps destination.\n\n2. Second: analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\n3. Third: create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\n4. Fourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\n5.

It takes a search_string, and optional parameters like include_subdirectories.\n\nI can use get_relevant_classes with search_string as \"CellResult\" and set include_subdirectories to true.\n\nFor the second request: \"Provide the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\"\n\nThis matches the get_signature function. It requires class_name and method_name.\n\nI need to call get_signature for each method: once for 'setCellValue' and once for 'getCellValue', both in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class.\n\nThe get_signature function is for a single method per call, so I'll have to make separate calls for each method.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

For get_signature of getCellValue:\n\n   - function: \"get_signature\"\n\n   - parameters: {\"class_name\": \"AbstractCellHandler\", \"method_name\": \"getCellValue\"}\n\n3. For get_signature of setCellValue:\n\n   - function: \"get_signature\"\n\n   - parameters: {\"class_name\": \"AbstractCellHandler\", \"method_name\": \"setCellValue\"}\n\nI need to format this as a JSON array in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe exact format is:\n\n<ToolCALL>\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name1\", \"parameters\": {...}},\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name2\", \"parameters\": {...}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\n</ToolCALL>\n\nSo, my response should only contain that.\n\nFinally, ensure that all required parameters are provided.

Events_3_FindEvents: This is for finding cultural events like concerts and plays in a specified city. That sounds perfect.\n\n4. Events_3_BuyEventTickets: This is for buying tickets, but the user is just asking to find events, not buy them.\n\n5. Hotels_2_BookHouse: For booking houses, not relevant.\n\n6. Hotels_2_SearchHouse: For searching houses, not relevant.\n\nSo, the appropriate function is Events_3_FindEvents.\n\nNow, let's check the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents:\n\n- event_type: Required. The category of the cultural event. The user mentioned \"music concerts or theater plays\", so I need to handle this. The function might expect a single string, like \"concert\" or \"play\". I might need to make separate calls if it's \"or\", but the function can take one event_type at a time. The description says \"The category of the cultural event\", so I'll assume I need to specify one. To be thorough, I could call it twice, once for each, but the user said \"any\", so maybe start with one.\n\n- city: Required. The name of the city, formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. For Los Angeles, it should be 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- date: Optional. The date of the event in 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user specified March 10th, 2023, so that's '2023-03-10'.\n\nThe user said \"this year is 2023\", so date should be '2023-03-10'.\n\nFor event_type, I need to choose. The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\". I could make two calls: one for \"concert\" and one for \"play\", but the function might accept a general term. To keep it simple, I'll assume \"concert\" for music concerts and \"play\" for theater plays. Since the user wants \"any\", I should probably call for both.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" And \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nI can output multiple function calls in one response.\n\nSo, I should call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once with event_type as \"concert\" and once with \"play\".\n\nFor the first call:\n\n- event_type: \"concert\"\n\n- city: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n\n- date: \"2023-03-10\"\n\nFor the second call:\n\n- event_type: \"play\"\n\n- city: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n\n- date: \"2023-03-10\"\n\nIs \"play\" the correct term?

The description says \"The category of the bus route based on the number of stops.\" I should use \"direct\" if that's a valid category, but it's not specified.

It requires the 'name' parameter, which is the full name of the partner's client.\n\n2. **partner.mandates**: This fetches mandates associated with a partner, based on status. It doesn't take a user name; it only takes a status.\n\nFor this query, I need to fetch mandates for individual users, so **user.mandates** seems appropriate.\n\nThe user mentioned two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\", and they want mandates that are pending and active.\n\nFor each user, I might need to call **user.mandates** twice: once for \"pending\" status and once for \"active\" status.\n\nThe function allows specifying a status, but if I specify one status, it will only return that status. The user wants both pending and active for each user.\n\nThe function description: \"Fetches the mandates associated with a user based on the provided user name and the status of the mandates.\" If I call it with status=\"pending\", I'll get only pending ones, and similarly for \"active\".\n\nTo get both, I need to make separate calls for each status per user.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active mandates\", so for each user, I need both.\n\nThere are two users, so potentially four calls: \n\n- For parath, pending\n\n- For parath, active\n\n- For bhanu, pending\n\n- For bhanu, active\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

From the function description, no. It seems to fetch based on the provided status.\n\nIf I don't provide a status, what happens? The param says it's required=\"false\", so if I omit it, it might fetch all statuses. Let me check: \"Fetches the mandates associated with a user based on the provided user name and the status of the mandates.\" It doesn't specify what happens if status is not provided.\n\nIn the description: \"based on the provided user name and the status\", but since status is not required, perhaps it fetches all if not specified.\n\nTo be precise, I should assume that if status is not provided, it might fetch all, but the user specifically wants pending and active, which might be subsets.\n\nThe function doesn't explicitly say what happens if status is omitted. To be safe, I should specify the statuses as requested.\n\nThe user wants \"all pending and active\", so if I call without status, I might get more than that, including other statuses, which isn't exactly what they asked.\n\nThe function is: \"Fetches the mandates associated with a user based on the provided user name and the status of the mandates.\"\n\nIf status is not provided, it probably fetches all mandates for that user.\n\nIn that case, for each user, I could just call once without specifying status, and get all, which includes pending and active.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active\", implying they want only those, not others. However, if the function doesn't allow filtering to multiple statuses at once, I might have to get all and then filter, but I can't filter; I have to return what the function provides.\n\nIn this setup, I think I just need to call the functions as is.\n\nTo match exactly, perhaps I should call for each status separately.\n\nThat might be inefficient. Let's think.\n\nPerhaps the best is to call for each user without status, assuming it gets all, and then the response can be processed later.\n\nThe system will handle the responses, and I need to fulfill the request.\n\nThe instructions: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format...\"\n\nTo be precise, let's look at the function's param: status is required=\"false\", and desc says: \"The status of the mandates to be fetched.\"\n\nIn the partner.mandates, it says if left empty, all are retrieved.\n\nFor user.mandates, it doesn't specify, but perhaps similar.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that if status is not provided, it fetches all mandates for that user.\n\nSo, for each user, I can call user.mandates with just the name, and get all mandates, which include pending and active.\n\nThen, the user can filter as needed from the response.\n\nThe user asked for \"all pending and active\", so getting all and letting them extract is fine, but if I can get only those, better.\n\nSince the function doesn't allow specifying multiple statuses, I think calling once per user is sufficient.\n\nIf I call with status=\"pending\", I get only pending; with \"active\", only active. To get both, I'd need two calls per user.\n\nThat would be four calls in total.\n\nThe format allows an array, so I can do that.\n\nPerhaps I should do that to be exact.\n\nThe query is: \"all pending and active mandates of users parath and bhanu\"\n\nSo, for user parath: pending and active mandates.\n\nFor user bhanu: pending and active mandates.\n\nTo get exactly that, I need to call for each status per user.\n\nIn practice, if I call without status, I get all, and the response can include only pending and active if needed, but I think the function will return all.\n\nI need to make the calls.\n\nAnother way: the system might allow multiple calls, and then the responses are combined.\n\nTo minimize, perhaps call once per user without status.\n\nLet's check the function again: for partner.mandates, it explicitly says if no status, all are retrieved.\n\nFor user.mandates, it's not specified, but likely the same.\n\nTo be precise, I'll go with calling for each status.\n\nSo, plan: Make four function calls:\n\n1. user.mandates with name=\"parath\" and status=\"pending\"\n\n2. user.mandates with name=\"parath\" and status=\"active\"\n\n3. user.mandates with name=\"bhanu\" and status=\"pending\"\n\n4. user.mandates with name=\"bhanu\" and status=\"active\"\n\nIn the response, I'll put an array of these four.\n\nThe format is an array of objects, each with function and parameters.\n\nYes.\n\nIs \"parath\" and \"bhanu\" the full name? The param says \"The full name of the partner's client\", so I'll assume it's as given.\n\nAlright, let's prepare the JSON.\n\nSo, the TOOLCALL will be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n```\n[\n  {\"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": {\"name\": \"parath\", \"status\": \"pending\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": {\"name\": \"parath\", \"status\": \"active\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": {\"name\": \"bhanu\", \"status\": \"pending\"}},\n  {\"function\": \"user.mandates\", \"parameters\": {\"name\": \"bhanu\", \"status\": \"active\"}}\n]\n```\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nOne potential issue: are \"pending\" and \"active\" the exact status strings? I'll assume they are, as per the function.\n\nIf not, that's on the function side.\n\nI think that's the way to go."}
