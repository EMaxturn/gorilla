First, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time.\n\nThe location given is in Vietnamese, but the example format in the function description uses English. However, the function's param description for loc says it's a string in the format 'Address, City, State'. The user's address is \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\". I should probably use that as is, even if it's in Vietnamese, since the function doesn't specify that the address needs to be in English. But maybe the system expects English addresses. Wait, the example given in the function is '123 Main St, Springfield, IL', so maybe the function expects English. However, the user's input is in Vietnamese. But the function's parameters don't specify language, so perhaps it's okay to use the address as provided. Alternatively, maybe the system can handle Vietnamese addresses. But since the function's example uses English, maybe the user's address should be converted. But the user provided it in Vietnamese, so maybe it's better to use the exact address they provided. Wait, the user wrote \"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\". So the address is in Vietnamese, but the city and state are in English. Maybe the function can handle that. Alternatively, maybe the system expects the full address in English. But since the user provided it in Vietnamese, perhaps the function is designed to accept that. So I'll proceed with the given address.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which matches the parameter. The time is 10 minutes. So the parameters are loc=\"123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704\", type=\"Plus\", time=10. All required parameters are present.

The user specified brewery as Creek, taste as slightly bitter, aroma as rich and chocolatey, color as dark, and style as porter. The other parameters like ABV or IBU aren't mentioned, so they can be omitted. The function requires all the first five parameters, so I need to make sure those are included.

The function get_movies can retrieve movies based on city, cinema hall, date, language, and format. The parameters required are city, which is mandatory. The other parameters are optional.\n\nThe user specified \"today\" and \"Mumbai\". The function's description says that if no date is provided, it defaults to the current date. Since the user mentioned \"today\", I don't need to specify the date unless there's a need to override. But since the function defaults to today's date, I can omit the movie_date parameter. \n\nThe city is clearly Mumbai. The other parameters like cinema_hall, movie_language, and movie_format are not mentioned, so they can be left out. The function call should only include city. \n\nWait, but the user is in India. The system note says to consider the current date in India. So even if the user didn't specify a date, the function would use India's current date. Since the user said \"today\", which aligns with the default, it's safe to proceed without specifying the date. \n\nSo the correct function call is get_movies with city set to \"Mumbai\". No other parameters are needed here. The user didn't mention any filters like cinema hall, language, or format, so those are optional and can be omitted."}

The user wants to retrieve Ethernet interface statistics from a specific node in a pod of a fabric. The node ID is 12, pod 10, and the IP address is 192.120.45.67.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available function is requests.get, which sends a GET request to a URL. The parameters required are the URL and a params dictionary.\n\nThe URL should be constructed with the base path. The example given in the function description is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So substituting the IP here, it would be https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo.\n\nNow, the query parameters. The user mentioned node ID 12, pod 10. The parameters likely need to include these values. The function's params parameter is a dictionary, so I should structure it with keys like 'node_id' and 'pod' or something similar. But the exact parameter names might depend on the API's requirements. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume that the parameters are 'node_id' and 'pod' as per the user's mention.\n\nSo the params dictionary would be {'node_id': 12, 'pod': 10}. Wait, but the user said \"pod 10 of the Network1 fabric\". Does the API require the fabric name as a parameter? The question doesn't mention it, but the function's params don't have a 'fabric' parameter. The example given in the function's URL doesn't include a fabric name. So maybe the fabric is part of the URL or the IP is already specific to that fabric. Since the IP is given as 192.120.45.67, perhaps that's already part of the Network1 fabric. So maybe the params only need node_id and pod.\n\nTherefore, the function call would be requests.get with the URL constructed from the IP and the params dictionary containing node_id=12 and pod=10. I need to make sure that the URL is correctly formatted with the IP and the params are properly structured as a dictionary."}

The user is looking for a housekeeper who provides ironing services in Bangkok's Chatuchak District with a 4.5 stars or higher rating. The available function is get_service_id, which retrieves a service's unique ID based on type, location, and rating.\n\nFirst, I need to map the user's request to the function's parameters. The service type here is ironing, which from the function's description corresponds to service_id 2. The province is Bangkok, which I assume has a province_id of 1. The district is Chatuchak, and the rating is 4.5. \n\nWait, the function's parameters include service_id (required), province_id (optional), district_name (optional), and rating (optional). The user's query specifies ironing services, so service_id should be 2. Province is Bangkok, which is province_id 1. District is Chatuchak, and the rating is 4.5. \n\nSo, I need to call get_service_id with service_id=2, province_id=1, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", and rating=4.5. That should retrieve the service ID for ironing in that area with the required rating. Let me check if all parameters are provided. The user didn't mention province_id, but since it's Bangkok, I can assume the province_id is 1. The district name is given, and the rating is 4.5. So the function call should include these parameters."}

The function get_service_providers seems relevant here. Let me look at its parameters. The service_id is required, and since the user mentioned ironing services, I need to find the correct service_id. From the description, service_id 2 is ironing. So service_id=2.\n\nNext, the location is Chonburi Province. The province_id for Chonburi is 3, as per the example given. So province_id=3. The user didn't specify a district or sub-district, so those parameters can be omitted. \n\nThe rating required is 4.5, so the rating parameter should be 4.5. The availability dates are 12/03/2024 16:00 to 18:00. The function parameters start_available_date and end_available_date need to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format.

The district_name and sub_district_name are optional but in this case, the user specified both, so I should include them. The rating parameter is a float, and the user mentioned 4.5 stars, so that's 4.5. \n\nNow, I need to map the service type. The service_id for ironing is 2, as per the description.
