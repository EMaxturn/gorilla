The parameters required are country, species, and years. \n\nFor Bangladesh and India, the last 5 years would mean years=5.

Then, for Nepal and Malaysia, call the same function with the respective countries and years. \n\nWait, the user also wants the projected population for Nepal and Malaysia.

There are two functions: get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nLooking at get_sculpture_details, it requires a museum location and a sculpture ID. The user provided both locations but didn't mention specific IDs. The other function, get_artwork_price, requires the museum location, sculpture material, and dimensions (as an array of integers). \n\nThe user mentioned two sculptures. For the first one, the material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. The second is bronze, size 6x3 ft.

The get_artwork_price function needs the museum location, material, and dimensions. The user provided both locations, but the materials and sizes are specified. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the average price.

Since the parameters are provided, even if the IDs are missing, but the materials and sizes are given, maybe the functions can be used. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call both functions with the provided parameters.

Let me check the parameters. The function 'biological.calc_energy' requires mols, substance, and joules_per_mol. The substance here is glucose, which is C6H12O6. The default for glucose is 2800 kJ/mol, so maybe I don't need to specify it, but since the user provided it, I should include it. So, call biological.calc_energy with mols=5, substance='C6H12O6', and joules_per_mol=2800.0.\n\nSecond part: Calculate biomass given energy and efficiency. The biomass is energy divided by efficiency. So, biomass = energy / efficiency. Again, using the same function, but maybe the parameters are different.

So, call that function with energy from the first part and efficiency 0.1.\n\nThird part: Calculate work done by the machine. The work is energy multiplied by distance.

The user has two main tasks here. First, modifying the painting's attributes, then predicting the evolutionary rate of an African elephant, and finally calculating the probability of a royal flush in poker.\n\nStarting with the painting modification. The current painting is 24x36 inches, acrylic, blue dominant. The user wants to change it to 30x40 inches, oil, and red dominant. So I need to use the modify_painting function. The parameters required are size, medium, and dominant_color. The size is 30x40, medium is oil, and dominant color is red. The previous parameters were blue, so I'll replace that.\n\nNext, the evolutionary rate prediction. The user mentioned using the Darwin model for the African elephant over 100 years. The prediction.evolution function needs species, years, and model. The species is African elephant, years is 100, model is Darwin. The default model is Darwin, so if not specified, it's already set, but I should include it to be safe.\n\nThen, the poker probability. The problem states there are 4 royal flushes in a 52-card deck, and the result should be rounded to 3 decimal places. The calculate_probability function requires total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The total outcomes are 52, favorable is 4, and round_to is 3. So I need to call that function with those parameters.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are correctly formatted. For the painting, the size is a string, medium is a string, dominant color is a string. For the evolutionary rate, species is a string, years is an integer, model is a string. For the poker probability, total_outcomes is 52, favorable is 4, round_to is 3. All parameters are correctly specified. No missing parameters here. So I'll list each function call accordingly."}

First, they want to predict the house price in San Francisco, California. The parameters given are area 2000 sq ft, 4 rooms, and built in 1985. The function predict_house_price requires area, rooms, year, and location. All these parameters are provided, so I can use that function.\n\nNext, they need information about lawsuits involving Mr. John Doe in San Francisco county. The lawsuit_search function needs entity, county, and optionally state. The entity here is Mr. John Doe, county is San Francisco, and state is California. Since the state is not specified, but the default is California, maybe it's okay to include it. So I'll call lawsuit_search with entity 'John Doe', county 'San Francisco', and state 'California'.\n\nThen, the probability part. The user provided total outcomes 1000 and favorable 5. The calculate_probability function needs total_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, and round_to. The round_to is 3, which is the default, but the user specified it, so I'll include it.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. Let me check each function's required parameters again. For predict_house_price, all required are there. For lawsuit_search, entity and county are required. For calculate_probability, total_outcomes and favorable_outcomes are required. The user mentioned rounding to 3 decimal places, which matches the function's default, so no need to adjust.\n\nSo the function calls should be:\n\n1. predict_house_price with area 2000, rooms 4, year 1985, location San Francisco.\n2. lawsuit_search with entity 'John Doe', county 'San Francisco', state 'California'.\n3. calculate_probability with total_outcomes 1000, favorable_outcomes 5, round_to 3.\n\nI think that's all. No parameters are missing here. Each function is called with the necessary parameters."}

First, they want to know the types of fish collectable in Animal Crossing during the Summer season. Then, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. Next, details of lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018, and the binomial probability.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the first part about fish: there's 'get_collectables_in_season' which requires game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish', so I need to set item_type to 'fish'. The parameters are correct here.\n\nNext, the highest score in Fortnite on PlayStation in Asia. The 'game_score.highest' function needs game, platform, and region. The user mentioned Fortnite, PlayStation, and Asia. So that's covered.\n\nThen, lawsuits for Apple Inc. in 2018. The 'lawsuit_details.find' function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user provided Apple Inc. and 2018, but case_type isn't mentioned. The default is all, so maybe case_type can be omitted. But since the user didn't specify, I'll include it as optional.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability. The 'calculate_binomial_probability' function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7. All parameters are present, so that's straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure each function call uses the correct parameters. Let me check again. For each part, the parameters are correctly set. No missing parameters. So the answer should include all four function calls with the specified parameters."}
