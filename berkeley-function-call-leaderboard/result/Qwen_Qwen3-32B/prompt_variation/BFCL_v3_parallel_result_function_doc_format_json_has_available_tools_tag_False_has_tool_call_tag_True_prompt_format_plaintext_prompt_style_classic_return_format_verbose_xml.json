The location is San Diego, CA. The movies are Tenet and No Time To Die. The times are 5 pm and 7:30 pm.\n\nWait, the movie parameter is an array with enum values of Tenet and No Time To Die. The time is an array of strings. The user wants two theatres, each with one movie and time. But the function's parameters require all three: location, movie array, and time array. How do I structure this?\n\nMaybe the function can handle multiple movies and times. But the user wants two different theatres, each showing one of the movies at their respective times. So perhaps I need to call the function twice, once for each movie and time. But the function's parameters require all three to be provided each time. Wait, the parameters are in a dict with required fields location, movie, time. So each call must include all three. But the user wants two different theatres with different movies and times. So maybe two separate function calls? But the function's parameters are in a single call. Hmm.\n\nWait, the function's parameters are location (string), movie (array of the two enum options), and time (array of strings). Wait, no, looking back: the movie parameter is an array of strings, each being one of the two enum options. The time is an array of strings. So maybe the user wants to check for both movies and both times in one call. But the user wants two theatres, each with one movie and one time. So perhaps the function can be called once with location, movie as [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], and time as [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]. But the function might return theatres that have either movie at either time. But the user wants two theatres, each with specific movie and time. So maybe the function needs to be called twice, once for each movie and time. But the function's parameters require all three fields. Wait, the required parameters are location, movie, and time. So each function call must include all three. So for the first theatre, movie is [\"Tenet\"], time [\"5 pm\"], and location San Diego. For the second, movie [\"No Time To Die\"], time [\"7:30 pm\"], same location. But the function's parameters require arrays for movie and time. Wait, the movie is an array of strings from the enum, and time is an array of strings. So maybe each function call can handle multiple movies and times. But the user wants two different theatres, each with one movie and one time. So perhaps two separate function calls, each with one movie and one time. But the function's parameters require arrays. Wait, the parameters for movie and time are arrays. So if I pass [\"Tenet\"] and [\"5 pm\"], that's allowed. Similarly for the other. So I can make two function calls: first with movie [\"Tenet\"], time [\"5 pm\"], location San Diego. Second with movie [\"No Time To Die\"], time [\"7:30 pm\"], same location. That way, each call checks for a specific movie and time. Then the results can be combined to find two theatres. So the correct approach is to make two separate function calls. Therefore, the tool calls should be two instances of find_movie_showing with the respective parameters."}

Then do the same for 36 and 48, and then with 72 and 96.\n\nWait, the first part is HCF of 45 and 60. Let me calculate that. The HCF of 45 and 60 is 15. Then, using that 15, find HCF with 90 and 120. So HCF of 15, 90, and 120? Wait, the function given is for two numbers. Oh right, the function math.hcf takes two numbers. So maybe the user wants to first find HCF of 45 and 60, then take that result and find HCF with 90, then again with 120? Or maybe the second part is to find HCF of (90, 120) and then combine with the previous result? The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.\n\nThe user says: \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So after getting HCF(45,60)=15, then find HCF(15, 90) and then HCF of that result with 120? Or maybe HCF(15, 90, 120)? But the function only takes two numbers. So perhaps the user wants to do HCF(15, 90) first, then HCF of that result with 120. Similarly for the other pair.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFirst part:\n1. HCF(45, 60) = 15\n2. HCF(15, 90) = 15\n3. HCF(15, 120) = 15\n\nSecond part:\n4. HCF(36, 48) = 12\n5. HCF(12, 72) = 12\n6. HCF(12, 96) = 12\n\nBut the user's question is a bit unclear. The wording says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". So maybe after getting 15 from (45,60), find HCF of 15 with 90 and 120. But since the function is for two numbers, I need to do it step by step. So first HCF(15,90), then HCF(result, 120). Similarly for the other pair.\n\nSo the required function calls would be:\n\nFirst, call math.hcf with 45 and 60. Then take the result (15) and call math.hcf with 15 and 90. Then take that result (15) and call math.hcf with 15 and 120. Then do the same for 36 and 48, then with 72 and 96.\n\nBut the user wants all these steps. Since each function call is separate, I need to make multiple function calls. However, the system might process each function call one by one, so I need to structure them in order.\n\nSo the first function call is math.hcf(45,60). Then, using the result, call math.hcf(15,90). Then math.hcf(15,120). Then math.hcf(36,48), then math.hcf(12,72), then math.hcf(12,96).\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as two separate tasks: first the (45,60) and then (90,120), and then the (36,48) and (72,96). So maybe the first part is HCF(45,60) and then HCF of that result with (90,120). But how to combine three numbers? Since HCF is associative, HCF(a, b, c) is HCF(HCF(a,b), c). So the steps would be as I outlined.\n\nTherefore, the required function calls are:\n\n1. math.hcf(45, 60)\n2. math.hcf(result1, 90)\n3. math.hcf(result2, 120)\n4. math.hcf(36, 48)\n5. math.hcf(result4, 72)\n6. math.hcf(result5, 96)\n\nEach of these steps requires a separate function call. Since the system processes each function call in sequence, I need to generate each one in order. However, the user's question is a single query, so I need to make sure all necessary function calls are included in the response."}

For the first stock: purchase_price is 150, sale_price is 180, and dividend is 20. So I'll call the function with these values. \n\nSecond stock: purchase_price 200, sale_price 210, dividend 30. Again, plug those into the function.\n\nThird stock: purchase_price 250, sale_price 300, dividend 40. Same process.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are included. Since the function requires purchase_price and sale_price, which are provided for each, and dividends are given, I should include them. Each function call is separate for each stock. So three separate calls should be made. Let me check the parameters again to confirm. Yes, all required parameters are there. The type for each is integer, which matches the inputs. So the tool calls should be correct."}

Let me check the functions available. There's the algebra.quadratic_roots function which takes a, b, c as parameters. Both equations have the coefficients provided. For the first equation, a=3, b=7, c=2. The second one has a=5, b=-4, c=1. I need to call the function twice with these parameters. Let me make sure all required parameters are present. Yes, both equations have a, b, c. So I'll generate two function calls."}

The user wants to find public libraries in three different cities with specific facilities. First, New York, NY needs libraries with Reading Room and Fiction. Then Los Angeles, CA with Wi-Fi and Children Section. Finally, Chicago, IL with Cafe and Reading Room.\n\nThe function provided is public_library.find_nearby, which takes location (string) and facilities (array of specific strings). Each location has different facilities required. I need to make three separate function calls for each city with their respective facilities.\n\nCheck if all required parameters are present. Each query has location and facilities. The facilities are from the enum list, so Reading Room, Fiction, Wi-Fi, Children Section, Cafe are all valid. So each call should work. No missing parameters here. So three function calls in total."}
