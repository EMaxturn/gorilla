There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for updating drink orders. \n\nFor the food part, the user mentioned a Caesar salad without anchovies. The ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. Since they want to remove anchovies, I'll set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". The newIngredients should be \"Caesar salad\" and the specialInstructions might be \"without anchovies\". \n\nThen, for the drink order 123, the user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id, new_preferences, and special_instructions. The drink_id is 123. The preferences include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", and milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions might be \"large hot coffee\". \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The drink_id is a string, and the preferences are dictionaries.

Each with the appropriate parameters. No missing parameters here. The user's request is fully covered by these functions."}

First, they want to clone a Git repository from GitHub. The command given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I need to use the clone_repo function here. The parameters required are repo_url, which is provided, and the destination. Since the user didn't specify the destination, I'll use the default which is '.'.\n\nNext, they need to analyse the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory_name. The repo is in a directory, so I'll assume the directory is 'nodejs-welcome' and call that function.\n\nThen, they want to create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, the directory is 'nodejs-welcome', so I'll use that. But wait, the user mentioned creating a Dockerfile, so I should make sure the parameters are correct. The default is 'directory_name', so that's covered.\n\nAfter that, they need to create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs directory_name. The directory here is 'nodejs-welcome', so I'll call that. The parameters include deployment_name, image_name, etc., but the user didn't specify these, so I'll use defaults where possible.\n\nNext, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. The commit message and branch name are optional, so I'll use the defaults. The force_push parameter is also optional, so I'll leave it as default.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention adding changed files. The push function's default commit message is 'Update changes' and branch is 'main'. So I should call push_git_changes_to_github with those defaults. Also, the destination is '.' by default, so that's correct.\n\nI need to make sure each step is covered. Let me check each function again. Clone repo, analyse, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAML, push changes. All required parameters are provided except maybe the destination for clone, but since the user didn't specify, I use the default. So the function calls should be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination '.'.\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome'.\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name 'nodejs-welcome', commit message default, branch default, force_push default.\n\nYes, that should cover all the steps.

The functions provided are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe user is asking for relevant classes related to 'CellResult'. The get_relevant_classes function seems appropriate here. The parameters required are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search_string should be 'CellResult'. The case sensitivity is optional, but the user might want it to be case-sensitive. The include_subdirectories is set to false by default, but since they want to include subdirectories, I should set that to true.\n\nNext, they need the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. The class here is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the methods are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is optional, so I can leave it as default.\n\nSo, the steps are: call get_relevant_classes with search 'CellResult', include subdirectories, and then get_signature for both methods in the specified class.

The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned a side of 5 cm, so I need to convert that into a float. Since 5 cm is 0.05 meters, but the function's parameter is in units, maybe the size is in centimeters. Wait, the function's parameter is a float, so I can just use 5.0. So the call would be get_area_of_square with size 5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a location parameter. The user specified Queenstown Singapore, so I should format the location as 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit is optional, but the default is Fahrenheit, so I can leave it out or set it. The answer should include both function calls.\n\nWait, the user's question is two separate parts. So I need to make two function calls. Let me check the parameters again. The get_area_of_square requires 'size' as a float. The user's side is 5 cm, so 5.0. The location is Queenstown Singapore. So the two function calls are:\n\n1. get_area_of_square with size 5.0\n2. get_current_weather with location \"Queenstown, Singapore\"\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted.

So perhaps the correct call is to use the function with event_type as 'Music' and date as '2023-03-10', and also 'Theater' if needed. But the user's question is about either, so maybe just one.
