Let me check the available functions. There's a function called Weather_1_GetWeather that retrieves weather forecast for a city and date. The parameters needed are city and date. The default date is 2019-03-01, but the user provided April 22nd, 2023. So I need to replace the default date with the user's input. The city is Rutherford, NJ. So I should call the function with city='Rutherford, NJ' and date='2023-04-22'. Let me make sure the date format is correct. The function expects the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, which 2023-04-22 is. Alright, that should get the required information."}

Let me check the available functions. There's the Movies_3_FindMovies function. The parameters are directed_by, genre, and cast. The user specified the director, so I should set directed_by to 'James Gray'. Since they didn't mention genre or cast, I'll leave those as default 'dontcare'. So the function call should be Movies_3_FindMovies with directed_by='James Gray'. That should retrieve the movie they're looking for."}

Let me check the available functions. There's a play_spotify_song function. The parameters needed are query, shuffle, and volume. The query should be in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName'. The user provided the song name and artist, so I can format the query as 'track:Dil Nu artist:Maninder Buttar'. Shuffle is default, so I don't need to set it. Volume is optional, so I can leave it as default. So the function call should be play_spotify_song with the query as specified. No other parameters are needed here."}

The departure_location is JFK, the date is 16th March 2024, and the time is 14:00. I need to make sure the date format is correct. The example uses 'dd/mm/yyyy', so 16/03/2024 should be okay. The time is 14:00, which is 2 PM. So I should call the function with these parameters."}
