There's video_games.on_sale, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which fetches the selling price. The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might show if it's on sale, but the user is asking for the cheapest price. However, the store_price function gives the current price, which could be the cheapest. But maybe there's a sale price that's lower. But the question is about the cheapest selling price, so perhaps store_price is the correct function.\n\nThe parameters required for store_price are game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call video_games.store_price with those parameters. The region is optional, but since the user specified United States, I should include it. So the function call would be store_price with those values. The on_sale function might not be necessary here because the user is asking for the price, not if it's on sale. So the answer should be the store_price function with the given parameters."}

The user is asking to find out the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about finding the final speed.\n\nThe formula that relates distance, initial speed, final speed, and time is: \ndistance = (initial_speed * time) + (0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2). \nBut since initial_speed is 0, it simplifies to distance = 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. \nSolving for acceleration would give acceleration = 2 * distance / time\u00b2. \nThen, final speed can be found using v = u + at, where u is initial speed (0), so v = a * t. \n\nBut the user wants the final speed, not the acceleration. So maybe there's a function that directly calculates speed from rest given distance and time. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions provided: there's kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function's parameters are distance (integer, required), time (integer, required), and initial_speed (optional). So if I call this function with distance=20 and time=4, initial_speed=0, it should compute the final speed. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). The user's question specifies that the object started from rest, so initial_speed is 0. The function should handle that. \n\nSo the correct function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But the initial_speed is optional, so maybe it's allowed to omit it. However, the function's parameters require distance and time as required, and initial_speed is optional. So the call would be with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. \n\nAlternatively, if the function requires all parameters, but the initial_speed is optional, then it's okay to include it. The user's question provides all necessary parameters: distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds, and initial speed is 0. So the function should be called with those values."}

The required parameters are desired_sum, sides_per_die, and n_rolls. The user is asking for a sum of 7, so desired_sum is 7. The default for n_rolls is 1, which is correct because they're rolling two dice. Wait, but the function's description says it's for rolling two dice. Wait, the parameters: the function's n_rolls is the number of dice. Wait, the description says \"number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1\". So if they're rolling two dice, then n_rolls should be 2. But the function's parameters have n_rolls as a parameter. So the user is asking for two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. But the function's default is 1. So I need to set n_rolls=2. Also, the sides_per_die is required. The default for sides_per_die is usually 6, which is standard for a die. So the function parameters are desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the function's parameters have sides_per_die as required. So the user didn't specify the number of sides, but it's standard. So I can assume sides_per_die=6. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability(desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6). Let me check if that's correct. Yes, that should calculate the probability of getting a 7 with two 6-sided dice. The other functions are for coins or cards, which aren't relevant here.
