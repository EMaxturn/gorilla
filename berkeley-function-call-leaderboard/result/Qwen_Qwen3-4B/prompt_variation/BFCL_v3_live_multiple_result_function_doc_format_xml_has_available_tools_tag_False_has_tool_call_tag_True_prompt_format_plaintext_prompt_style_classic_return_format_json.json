The second one has loc, type, and time (optional). The user provided all three parameters: location, type as 'Plus', and time 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the first function's loc parameter requires 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided exactly. The second function's loc is 'City, State', but the user's address includes the street. However, the user's input has 'Berkeley, CA' as the city and state, but the full address is given. Wait, the user's address is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which includes the street address.

The available functions don't include a direct way to look up personal information like birthdays unless it's stored in the core or archival memory.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's 'recall_memory_search' which searches conversation history. But the user hasn't provided any prior messages that mention Shishir Patil's birthday. The core memory has 'persona' and 'human' sections. The 'human' section might store user details, but the user hasn't given any info about Shishir Patil in the conversation history. \n\nWait, the user is asking about Shishir Patil, but the initial system message mentions that the core memory has a 'human' sub-block for user details. However, in this case, the user is asking about a different person, Shishir Patil, not the current user.

The user might expect me to know it, but according to the functions provided, I don't have access to that information. Therefore, I can't proceed with sending a message without the birthday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the 'send_message' function to send a generic message, but the query specifically asks for a congratulatory message on his birthday.

The account number is given, along with the account name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and maybe the individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dictionary. The BankStatementOverView function might require that, but the user hasn't given individual transactions. However, the user did mention the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. Maybe the transaction_overview can include those totals. But looking at the function's description, it says \"a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts.\" So perhaps the transaction_overview should include the total deposits, total withdrawals, number of transactions, etc.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided individual transactions. However, the user might expect that the function can generate the summary based on the provided totals. Alternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed here. Let me check the functions again.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's also transaction_summary.generate, which requires a list of transactions, starting and ending dates, total deposits, withdrawals, balances, and customer info. But the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. So maybe the transaction_summary.generate isn't applicable here because it needs the list of transactions. However, the user might not have that data. \n\nAlternatively, the BankStatementOverView function might be the right one to use, even if the transaction_overview is a summary of the totals provided by the user. The user provided the starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. So perhaps the transaction_overview can be a dictionary with those values. \n\nSo, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n  \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n  \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n  \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n  \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview is a dict, and the function's parameters require it. The user hasn't provided individual transactions, so maybe the transaction_overview is constructed from the totals they provided. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the transaction_summary.generate function is used to generate the summary, but that function requires a list of transactions. Since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the BankStatementOverView is the correct function to call with the given totals as part of the transaction_overview.\n\nSo, the correct function to call is BankStatementOverView with the parameters as above. The other functions like TransactionsV2 or Alltransactions might not be needed here because the user is asking for an overview, not to process individual transactions or retrieve all transactions.\n\nTherefore, the tool call should be to BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters."}

So maybe the list_servers function can take a type parameter that is 'mtna' to filter those servers. But the function's description says that if the type is 'all' or omitted, all servers are listed. So maybe the type parameter can be set to 'mtna' to list only MTNA servers. However, the function's parameters don't specify possible values for the type.

Include_tools is a boolean, and since the user didn't mention it, maybe set it to false unless specified. But the function's description says it includes programming languages, frameworks, and tools. The user asked for the tech stack, which typically includes tools. However, the function has an include_tools parameter. Wait, the default might be to include them unless specified otherwise. But the function's parameters say include_tools is required? No, looking back, the parameters for get_tech_stack: include_tools is required? No, the required attribute is false. So the user didn't specify, so maybe we can leave it as default. The as_of_date is also optional, so if not provided, it defaults to current date. So the correct function call would be get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\". The other parameters can be omitted since they are optional and the user didn't specify. So the tool call should be to get_tech_stack with employee_id: \"Adriel\"."}

The function expects the airport code or city name. Atlanta's airport code is ATL, but the user said Atlanta, GA, so either should work. Similarly, Boston's code is BOS, but the user specified Boston, MA. \n\nI need to make sure the dates are in the correct format: YYYY-MM-DD. Departure is 2023-03-12, return is 2023-03-19. The user didn't mention seating class, number of tickets, or preferred airlines, so those parameters can be omitted. \n\nSo the function call should include origin_airport as \"Atlanta, GA\", destination_airport as \"Boston, MA\", departure_date as \"2023-03-12\", and return_date as \"2023-03-19\". That should cover the necessary information. Let me double-check the parameters to ensure I didn't miss anything. The function requires origin and destination, which are provided. The dates are correctly formatted. The other parameters are optional and not specified, so they can be left out. \n\nI think that's all. The user didn't mention anything about hotels or attractions, so only the flight search is needed here."}

The location parameter should be in the format 'City, Country', so 'Sydney, Australia' is correct. Then, the star_rating is 4, so I'll set that to '4'. The smoking_allowed parameter should be true since they want smoking allowed. The number_of_rooms is two, so I'll set that to '2'. \n\nWait, the number_of_rooms in the function's description says it can be a positive integer or 'dontcare'. The user specified two rooms, so '2' is correct. Let me make sure all parameters are included. Location is required, star_rating is optional but specified, smoking_allowed is optional but needed here, and number_of_rooms is specified. So the function call should include all these parameters. I think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly."}

The date format should be YYYY-MM-DD, so 2023-03-10. \n\nWait, the user didn't specify the exact event type, just that it's a music concert or play.

However, the user might not need both. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both in one call if the event_type is a list. But according to the function definition, event_type is a single string. \n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents once with event_type as \"concert\" and another call with event_type as \"play\". But the user might not need both. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept \"music\" as the event_type, but the user specified concert or play. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can take \"concert\" or \"play\" as the event_type. So I should call the function with event_type as \"concert\" and \"play\" in separate calls. But the user's query is a single request.

Therefore, to cover both possibilities, I should make two separate calls. \n\nBut wait, the user said \"preferably a music concert or a play.\" So maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play\". Therefore, I need to call the function twice.

The user provided the restaurant name as Balthazar, location as New York. The time is 8 in the evening, which in 24-hour format is 20:00. The date is this Friday. I need to figure out the exact date. If today is, say, October 25th, this Friday would be October 30th. But since the current date isn't given, maybe the function expects the user to input the date in ISO format. Wait, the user said \"this Friday,\" so I need to calculate the correct date. However, the function requires the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. But the user hasn't specified the exact date, just \"this Friday.\" Hmm, maybe the system can handle that, but the function requires the date parameter.

Since they want to book tickets, the GetTrainTickets function is the right choice because it's for reserving tickets with specific parameters.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. The user specified Portland, OR to Seattle, WA. The date is May 15, 2023, but the journey starts one day before. Wait, the date_of_journey is May 15, but the start time is one day before. Wait, the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so if the journey starts one day before, maybe the date is May 14? Or is the date_of_journey the actual date, and the start time is on that day? The user says \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But the function's date_of_journey is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. The user might mean that the journey starts on May 15, but the departure is one day before, which would be May 14. Wait, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, but the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before that day, so May 14. But the date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so perhaps the user intended the journey to be on May 15, but the departure is at 12:00 AM on May 15, which is one day before May 16. Wait, this is confusing. The user says \"starting at one day before\", so maybe the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date. Wait, perhaps the user is saying that the journey is on May 15, but the train departs one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed with the given information. The date_of_journey is May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time is one day before. Wait, the journey_start_time is in 24-hour format. If the journey is on May 15, starting one day before, that would be May 14. But the date_of_journey is May 15. This is conflicting. Maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 15, but the departure is at 12:00 AM, which is one day before May 16. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before that day, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to work with the given info. The function requires date_of_journey as 'YYYY-MM-DD', so I'll use May 15, 2023. The journey_start_time is one day before, but that's unclear. Wait, the user says \"starting at one day before\", so perhaps the journey starts on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. That's conflicting. Maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. This is confusing. Maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 14. But the user said May 15. Hmm. Maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey starts on May 15, but the departure is at 12:00 AM, which is one day before May 16. But that's not clear. Since the function requires date_of_journey as the date of the journey, I'll proceed with May 15, 2023. The journey_start_time is one day before, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the user meant that the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is one day before the journey date. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 15. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the date is May 14. But the user said May 15. I'll have to proceed with the given information. The user might have meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, which is May 14. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is one day before the journey date, which is not possible. This is confusing. Maybe the user intended the journey to start on May 15, and the start time is one day before, which is May 14. But that's not possible. I think the correct approach is to use the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as 00:00 (midnight) on that day. But the user said \"starting at one day before\", which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey is on May 15, and the start time is one day before, which is May 14. But that's not possible. I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as 00:00. The user might have intended that. So, the parameters would be:\n\n_from: Portland, OR\n\nto: Seattle, WA\n\ndate_of_journey: 2023-05-15\n\njourney_start_time: 00:00 (assuming one day before is midnight on May 15)\n\nnumber_of_adults: 4\n\ntrip_protection: true\n\n_class: business\n\nSo, the function call would be to Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with these parameters."}

The get_service_providers function seems right here. It allows filtering by location, availability, and rating. The parameters needed are province_id, district_name, start_available_date, and avg_rating. \n\nBangkok's province_id is 1. Chatuchak is a district, so district_name is \"Chatuchak\". The available date is March 22, 2024. The user mentioned \"good reputation,\" which probably translates to a high average rating. Let's set avg_rating to 4.5 or higher. \n\nWait, the function's avg_rating parameter is a float. The user didn't specify exactly, but \"good\" is subjective. Maybe default to a high value like 4.5. Also, the start_available_date needs to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format. The user said March 22nd, so maybe '2024-03-22 00:00:00' as the start. End_available_date can be null if it's open-ended. \n\nOther parameters like service_id might be useful. Since they're looking for cleaning, maybe service_id 1 (assuming 1 is cleaning). But the user didn't mention it, but maybe including it ensures the service type is correct. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe it's better to leave it out unless necessary. \n\nWait, the function has a service_id parameter. The example says 1 for cleaning. So including service_id=1 would narrow it down to cleaning services. That's probably a good idea. \n\nAlso, the user wants a good reputation. The has_quality_problem and is_excellent parameters might help. But since they didn't specify, maybe just using avg_rating is sufficient. \n\nSo the parameters would be: province_id=1, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", start_available_date=\"2024-03-22 00:00:00\", avg_rating=4.5, service_id=1. \n\nI should check if all required parameters are met. The function's required parameters are none, so it's okay. \n\nSo the function call should be get_service_providers with those parameters. The view_service_provider_profile is for viewing a specific profile, but the user hasn't provided a professional_id yet, so that's not needed now. \n\nTherefore, the correct tool call is to use get_service_providers with the specified parameters."}

The include_expired parameter is optional, but since the user is asking to remind them of all tokens, maybe they want both active and expired ones.

The other function, get_shareable_api_tokens, is for custom dashboards, which the user didn't mention. So the answer should be to call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\". The include_expired parameter isn't specified, so it's not included in the call. The user might need to check both active and expired, but since the user didn't specify, the function will return the default (not including expired). But maybe the user wants all tokens, so perhaps setting include_expired to true.

But since the user didn't specify, maybe the function should be called with include_expired set to true. However, the user might not know if they have expired tokens. But the function's description says that include_expired is a flag to determine if expired tokens should be included. So, to get all tokens, including expired, the parameter should be set to true. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe the assistant should assume that. Alternatively, maybe the default is false, so the function will return only active tokens. But the user might have forgotten all tokens, including expired ones. So, to be thorough, the assistant should call the function with include_expired set to true. But the user didn't specify, so maybe the assistant should make that assumption. However, the function's parameters have include_expired as optional, so the assistant can choose to include it or not. \n\nIn this case, the user is asking to remind them of all API tokens. So, the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to true to ensure all tokens are retrieved. But the user didn't mention expired tokens, so maybe the assistant should not assume. However, the function's default is false, so if we don't include include_expired, it will not return expired tokens.

However, the parameters for get_api_tokens don't include user_id, so perhaps the user is authenticated in some other way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the first function, which requires user_id. The user provided 12345, so that's the user_id. The include_revoked parameter is optional. The user wants all tokens, so maybe include_revoked is true? Or maybe the first function is for shareable tokens, which might be a subset. But the user is asking for all API tokens. \n\nWait, the description of get_shareable_api_tokens says \"shareable API tokens\", which might be different from all API tokens. The other function, get_api_tokens, says \"Retrieve a list of API tokens associated with the user's account.\" So maybe that's the correct one. But how is the user identified? The parameters for get_api_tokens don't include user_id. So perhaps the user is authenticated via another method, like using the username and password, but the user hasn't provided that. \n\nBut the user provided a user_id. Maybe the first function is the right one. The user wants all API tokens, so maybe include_revoked is true. But the user didn't specify, so maybe default to false. However, the user might want all, including revoked. But the function's description says \"include_revoked\" is a flag to determine whether to include revoked tokens. So if the user wants all, maybe set include_revoked to true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the shareable tokens, which are a subset. But the user said \"all API tokens\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the functions again. The first function is for shareable API tokens, which might be a specific type. The second function is for all API tokens. The user provided a user_id, which is required for the first function. The second function doesn't take user_id. So perhaps the user is using the first function, but the user_id is 12345. So the correct function call would be CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to true if needed. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just call it with user_id and include_revoked as false. But the user wants all tokens, so maybe include_revoked is true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the second function, but without user_id, how is that possible? Maybe the user is authenticated via another method, but the user hasn't provided that. \n\nWait, the user's message is \"I NEED ALL API TOKENS NOW!!! My user ID is 12345\". So they have a user_id, which is required for the first function. The second function doesn't take user_id. So perhaps the first function is the correct one. But the first function is for shareable tokens. The user might be confused between shareable and all tokens. But the user is asking for all, so maybe the first function is not the right one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the second function, but the parameters don't include user_id. So perhaps the user is authenticated via another way, like using the username and password, but the user hasn't provided that. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The user provided a user_id, but the second function doesn't use it. So maybe the correct function is the first one, even though it's for shareable tokens. But the user might be mistaken. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the second function, and the user_id is not required there. So the user is asking for all API tokens, so the second function is the right one. But how is the user identified? Maybe the username is used, but the user hasn't provided that. \n\nHmm. The user provided a user_id, but the second function doesn't take it. So perhaps the first function is the correct one. The user might be referring to shareable tokens, but the question says \"all API tokens\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using the second function, and the user_id is not needed there. So the function call would be to get_api_tokens with include_expired set to true. But the user hasn't provided a username or password. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. But given that the user provided a user_id, and the first function requires it, perhaps that's the correct function to call. So the function call would be CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to true to get all tokens, including revoked ones. But the user might not know that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the second function, and the user_id is not needed there. But the user hasn't provided a username. \n\nI think the correct approach is to use the first function since the user provided the user_id. So the function call would be to get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to true to get all tokens. But the user might not know that include_revoked is a parameter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the second function, but without the username, it's not possible. \n\nWait, the second function's parameters are include_expired, page, page_size. So maybe the user is authenticated via the username and password, but the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the user is not providing the necessary parameters for the second function. \n\nIn that case, the correct function to call is the first one, which requires the user_id. So the answer would be to call CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to true. But the user might not know that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the second function, but the parameters are missing. So the assistant should point out that the username is required. But the user hasn't provided it. \n\nBut the user's message says \"My user ID is 12345\", so the user is providing the user_id. The second function doesn't take user_id. So the first function is the correct one. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to true to get all tokens. But the user might not know that include_revoked is a parameter. However, the function's description says that include_revoked is optional. So the assistant should call it with user_id 12345 and include_revoked as true to get all tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all tokens, including revoked, so include_revoked is true. \n\nSo the final answer is to call the first function with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to true."}

The user is asking for details about Adriel's education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'detail_experience_and_education' and 'experiences_and_education'. The first one seems to retrieve detailed info about specific experiences or education, while the second gives a list of experiences and education. The user is asking for details of a specific education, so maybe 'detail_experience_and_education' is more appropriate. \n\nThe parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' require the type (either experience or education) and an optional name. The user mentioned \"education at UNS\", so the type should be \"education\" and the name would be \"Universitas Sebelas Maret\". \n\nWait, but the function's parameters have 'experience_or_education_type' as a required field. So I need to set that to \"education\" and 'experience_or_education_name' to \"Universitas Sebelas Maret\". That should retrieve the specific education detail. \n\nI should check if there are any other functions, but 'experiences_and_education' is more for listing, not detailed info. So the correct function here is 'detail_experience_and_education' with the parameters set as mentioned."}

The user is asking for a reminder at a specific time, which sounds like an alarm. The set_alarm function can handle specific times, including dates and times in various formats.\n\nThe alarm_time parameter can be in 24-hour format. 7:00 AM is 07:00 in 24-hour time. The date is given as 2023-12-01, so the full time would be '2023-12-01 07:00:00'. The purpose is to wake up for a meeting, so I should include that in the purpose parameter.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted.
