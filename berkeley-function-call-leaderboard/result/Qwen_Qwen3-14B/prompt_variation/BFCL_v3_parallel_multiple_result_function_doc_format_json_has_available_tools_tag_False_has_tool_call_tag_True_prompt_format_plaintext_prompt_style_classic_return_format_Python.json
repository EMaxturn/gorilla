There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it's about retrieving the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nFor the first sculpture: Philadelphia, marble, size 4x4. But the size is given as 4 ft x 4 ft. The function expects an array of integers. So maybe [4,4].

The user has three parts to solve. \n\nFirst, they need to calculate the total energy produced by the bacteria from consuming 5 moles of glucose. The given function for energy calculation is biological.calc_energy. The parameters required are mols, substance, and optionally joules_per_mol. The substance here is glucose (C6H12O6), and the default joules_per_mol is 2800 kJ/mol, which matches the user's input. So, I'll use calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\". The default joules_per_mol is already set, so no need to specify it unless the user provides a different value.\n\nSecond, using the energy from the first step, calculate the biomass with a 10% efficiency. The function here is biological.calc_biomass, which requires energy and efficiency. The efficiency is given as 10%, which is 0.1 in decimal. So, once we have the energy from step 1, we can plug that into calc_biomass with efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, calculate the work done by the machine moving 2 meters. The physical.calc_work function needs energy and distance. The energy here is the same as from step 1, and the distance is 2 meters. So, call calc_work with energy from step 1 and distance=2.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"given the total energy produced by the bacteria and the distance\". So the energy for work is the same as the total energy from the bacteria, not the biomass. So yes, using the energy from step 1 again here.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called in order. The first function is calc_energy, then calc_biomass using its output, then calc_work using the same energy. Each step depends on the previous, but since the functions are separate, I need to call them one after another. The parameters for each are as described. Let me check the parameters again to make sure. For calc_energy, mols is 5, substance is \"C6H12O6\". For calc_biomass, energy is the result of calc_energy, efficiency is 0.1. For calc_work, energy is the same as calc_energy's result, distance is 2. All required parameters are present. So the three function calls should be made in sequence."}

The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So, principle_amount is 5000, duration is 5 years, annual_rate is 4%. That should be straightforward.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually for 5 years. The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. The parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1. Wait, the function's default for compound_freq is 1, so maybe I don't need to specify it, but including it might be clearer. But the required parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate. So even if compound_freq is optional, including it would be good for accuracy.\n\nThird option: Initial investment of $3000 at 5% annual rate for 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function here is future_value. The parameters needed are initial_investment, interest_rate, time, and num_compoundings. The interest rate here is 5%, but the function expects a decimal, so 0.05. Time is 6 years, num_compoundings is 2. The required parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate, time. So all required are present.\n\nWait, for the second option, the function calc_Compound_Interest's parameters include compound_freq with a default of 1.
