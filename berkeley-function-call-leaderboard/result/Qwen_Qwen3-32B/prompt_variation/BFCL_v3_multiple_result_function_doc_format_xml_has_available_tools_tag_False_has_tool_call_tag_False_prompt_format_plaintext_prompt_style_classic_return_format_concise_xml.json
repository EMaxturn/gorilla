The function needs initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. No rounding specified, so I can omit that. So I should call the calculate_displacement function with those values. I don't need to use calculate_final_speed here because the question is about displacement, not speed. All the necessary info is there, so the function call should be straightforward."}

Let me see which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's video_games.store_price. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (optional, default US). Since the user specified the United States, I should include that. \n\nWait, the user wants the cheapest price. But does the store_price function return the current price, which might already be the cheapest, or do I need to check if it's on sale first? The on_sale function checks if the game is on sale. Maybe if it's on sale, the price would be lower. But the store_price function should return the current price regardless. So perhaps I should first check if it's on sale, but actually, the store_price might already give the sale price if applicable. \n\nHmm, but the user is asking for the cheapest price. If the game is on sale, the store_price would reflect that. So maybe just calling store_price with the given parameters is sufficient. Let me confirm the parameters: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is 'PlayStation', region is 'United States'. All required parameters are present. So the correct function call is video_games.store_price with those values. I don't need to check for sale status separately because the store_price function should return the current price, which would be the sale price if applicable. Therefore, the answer is to call store_price with the specified parameters."}

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, starting from rest means the initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which seems relevant. Its parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (optional). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function probably uses the kinematic equation for final speed when starting from rest, maybe v = 2d/t or something similar. \n\nWait, another function is 'calculate_acceleration', but the user isn't asking for acceleration directly. They need the final speed. So the 'calculate_speed_from_rest' function is the right choice here. \n\nLet me check the parameters again. The function requires distance and time as integers. The given values are 20 meters and 4 seconds, which are integers. The initial_speed is optional, but since it's starting from rest, we can set it to 0. But wait, the function's initial_speed is an integer, so 0 is acceptable. \n\nWait, but in the parameters for 'calculate_speed_from_rest', initial_speed is optional. If the function uses the equation v = u + at, and u is 0, then maybe the function can calculate it with just distance and time. Alternatively, maybe the function uses d = 0.5 * a * t\u00b2, then finds v = a*t. But regardless, the function is designed for this scenario. \n\nSo I should call 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance=20 and time=4. The initial_speed is 0, but since it's optional and the function might default to 0, maybe I don't need to include it. Wait, the function's parameters say initial_speed is required=false. So maybe the function assumes initial speed is 0 if not provided. So the correct call is to pass distance and time. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be to 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance 20 and time 4. The initial_speed isn't needed here because it's starting from rest, and the function probably defaults to 0 if not provided. \n\nI think that's the right approach. Let's go with that."}

The final temperature should be a weighted average based on the quantities. The formula would be (quantity1 * temp1 + quantity2 * temp2) / (quantity1 + quantity2). \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called calculate_final_temperature that takes exactly these parameters: quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, temperature2. The required parameters are all present in the question: quantity1 is 2, temp1 is 300, quantity2 is 3, temp2 is 400. So I can directly use that function without needing any additional information.

So I should call sort_list with elements ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'] and order 'asc'. \n\nWait, the order parameter is optional, so if not provided, does it default to ascending?

The year is 1954, and the category should be \"veterans\". \n\nI should check if the other functions could possibly be relevant. The get_bureau_statistics might have statistical data, but the category examples are employment, crime, health. Veterans don't fit there.

The parameters required are location and art_form. The user mentioned New York and modern sculpture, so art_form should be \"sculpture\".
