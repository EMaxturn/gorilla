The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions to use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function is perfect for this. The parameters needed are repo_url and optionally destination. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default which is the current directory. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url as the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. For this, the create_a_docker_file function is needed. The parameter is directory_name, which should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, I'll use the directory_name as the cloned repo's path. But wait, the clone_repo function's destination parameter is optional. If the user didn't specify, maybe the default is the current directory. So I'll call clone_repo first, then create_a_docker_file with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function is for this. The parameter is directory_name again. So after cloning, the directory_name would be the same as the cloned repo's path. So I need to call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with that directory_name.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git. The push_git_changes_to_github function is for pushing changes. The parameters are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. But the user hasn't specified commit message or branch name. The function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe the commit message is default. However, the user might need to specify the branch. But the problem says to follow the steps provided, so maybe the branch is the default. But the function requires directory_name, which is already set from the clone. So I'll call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as the cloned repo's path, and maybe commit_message as a default. But the user might need to provide a commit message. However, the problem says to do all steps, so perhaps the commit message is optional. But the user hasn't specified, so maybe the function will handle it. Alternatively, maybe the commit message is \"Initial commit\" or something. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the function can be called with the directory_name and the commit message as a default. However, the function's parameters include commit_message as optional. So I'll call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as the cloned repo's path, and maybe commit_message as a default value. But the user might need to specify it. However, the problem says to do all steps, so perhaps the commit message is not required. But the function requires it as optional. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push_git_changes_to_github function is supposed to push all changes. So maybe the function is called without a commit message, but the user might need to provide one. However, the problem says to follow the steps provided, so maybe the commit message is not required. But the function's parameters include commit_message as optional. So perhaps the user can call the function with the directory_name and omit the commit message. But the function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe the commit message is not needed. However, the function's parameters require it as optional. So I'll call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as the cloned repo's path, and commit_message as an empty string or default. But the user might need to specify it. However, since the user hasn't provided it, maybe it's okay to leave it out.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url and destination as default.\n2. create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n4. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the directory_name is correctly set. For example, after cloning, the directory is named nodejs-welcome. So the directory_name for create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file would be \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nFirst, clone_repo with repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" and destination as default.\n\nThen, create_a_docker_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen, create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen, push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function. The function's description says it pushes all changes, so maybe that's sufficient.\n\nSo the final function calls would be the four functions as above."}

The user is encountering a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories, and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned \"relevant classes\" so the get_relevant_classes function seems appropriate. The parameters required are search_string, case_sensitive, and include_subdirectories. The search string here would be 'CellResult', and since they want subdirectories, include_subdirectories should be true. The case sensitivity might be default false, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it as false.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The get_signature function is for retrieving method signatures. The parameters needed are class_name, method_name, and include_private (optional). For 'setCellValue', class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue'. Similarly for 'getCellValue'. Since the user didn't mention including private methods, maybe default to false.\n\nWait, the get_signature function's include_private is optional. So I need to call get_signature twice, once for each method. The user might need both signatures to check if the methods exist and their parameters. Also, the get_relevant_classes function will help find classes related to CellResult, which might include 'CellResult' or similar classes.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly set. For get_relevant_classes, search_string is 'CellResult', case_sensitive is false (default), and include_subdirectories is true. For get_signature, each method is called with their respective class and method names. The user might need to check if the methods exist and their parameters, so the signatures are crucial for overriding correctly.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', case_sensitive false, include_subdirectories true.\n2. get_signature for 'setCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' with include_private false.\n3. get_signature for 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' with include_private false.\n\nThat should cover both parts of the user's request."}

So I'll call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a location parameter. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\". The function's example includes \"San Francisco, CA\" or \"Paris, France\", so \"Queenstown Singapore\" should be acceptable. The unit is optional, but the user didn't specify, so I can leave it as default. So call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown Singapore\".\n\nI need to make sure both functions are called.

The parameters would be event_type as \"concert\" or \"play\", city as \"Los Angeles\", and date as \"2023-03-10\". Since the date is optional, but the user specified it, I should include it. The function doesn't require the event_type to be a specific category, so either \"concert\" or \"play\" should work.
