The animal_population.get_history function requires country, species, and years.

The data_loading function is for loading the CSV file, so I should call that first. The parameters required are file_path, which is 'dataset.csv', and delimiter, which defaults to comma. So the first step is to load the data using data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nOnce the data is loaded into a data structure, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The linear_regression_fit function requires x and y arrays. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], so I need to extract those columns from the loaded data. Assuming the loaded data is a DataFrame, I can access them as arrays. Then, call linear_regression_fit with x and y, and set return_residuals=True to get the residuals as requested.\n\nWait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit include x and y as arrays. So after loading the data, I need to convert the columns into arrays. For example, if the data is a DataFrame, data['sales'] would be a Series, which can be converted to an array. Similarly for future_sales. Then pass those arrays to the linear_regression_fit function with return_residuals=True.\n\nSo the steps are: load the data, extract x and y, fit the model with residuals, and return the residuals. The user wants the residuals calculated, so the function should return them. The function's parameters include return_residuals as a boolean, defaulting to false. So setting that to true will include them in the output.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The data_loading function's file_path is set, and delimiter is default.

The user mentioned using the calc_Simple_Interest function. So I need to call that function with principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=4%.\n\nNext, the second option is compound interest with the same principal of $5000, 5 years, and an annual rate of 3.5%, compounded annually. Here, the calc_Compound_Interest function is appropriate. The parameters would be principle_amount=5000, duration=5, annual_rate=3.5%, and compound_freq=1 (since it's compounded annually). Wait, the function parameters for calc_Compound_Interest include compound_freq, which is optional but defaults to 1.

The user has four separate requests here. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, they want to know the types of fish collectable in 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. The function get_collectables_in_season seems relevant here. The parameters needed are game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item type, so I'll set item_type to 'fish'. The game is 'Animal Crossing' and the season is 'Summer'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in 'Fortnite' on 'Playstation' in the 'Asia' region. The game_score.highest function requires game, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game is 'Fortnite', platform is 'Playstation', and region is 'Asia'. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nThird, they want details of lawsuits for 'Apple Inc.' in 2018. The lawsuit_details.find function needs company_name, year, and case_type. The user mentioned the year 2018 and the company, but didn't specify the case type. Since the case_type is optional and defaults to all, I can omit it. So parameters are company_name='Apple Inc.', year=2018.\n\nLastly, the binomial probability calculation. The calculate_binomial_probability function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. The user provided 10 trials, 3 successes, and 0.7 probability. All parameters are present, so I'll call that function with those values.\n\nI need to make sure each function is called correctly with the right parameters. Let me check each one again to avoid any mistakes. The first function uses get_collectables_in_season with the correct parameters. The second uses game_score.highest with all required parameters. The third uses lawsuit_details.find with the company and year. The fourth uses calculate_binomial_probability with all given values. All parameters are covered, so the function calls should be accurate."}
