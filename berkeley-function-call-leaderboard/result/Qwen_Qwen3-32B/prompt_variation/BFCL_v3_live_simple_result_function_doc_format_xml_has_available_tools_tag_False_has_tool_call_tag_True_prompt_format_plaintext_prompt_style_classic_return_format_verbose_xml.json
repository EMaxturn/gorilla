The only function provided is requests.get, which sends a GET request to a URL with parameters. The URL should be the base path without query parameters, and the params are the query parameters.\n\nThe URL example given in the function is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. So I need to replace {ip} with the provided IP address, 192.120.45.67. The parameters should include the node details: pod 10, node ID 12, and the fabric Network1. \n\nWait, the function's params are a dictionary. The required parameters for the URL are the IP, which is provided. Then, the query parameters need to specify the interface info for the Ethernet interfaces. But the user is asking for Ethernet stats, so maybe the parameters should include something like 'interfaceType=Ethernet', 'podId=10', 'nodeId=12', 'fabric=Network1'. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters in the GET request include all the necessary filters. The exact parameter names might depend on the API, but since the user hasn't specified, I'll assume that the API expects parameters like pod, node, fabric, and interface type. \n\nSo the URL would be formed by replacing {ip} with 192.120.45.67, leading to 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. The params dictionary would include 'podId': '10', 'nodeId': '12', 'fabric': 'Network1', and maybe 'interfaceType': 'Ethernet' if needed. However, the user didn't mention interface type, but they specifically asked for Ethernet stats. So including that might be necessary. But if the API doesn't require it, maybe it's optional. Since the user is asking for Ethernet, I'll include it to be precise.\n\nWait, the function's example URL includes 'interfaceInfo' as the endpoint. Maybe the parameters are already structured to get interface info, so the pod, node, and fabric are required. The user didn't mention interface type, but they want Ethernet stats. Maybe the API requires specifying the interface type, or maybe it's optional. Since the user is specific, I'll include 'interfaceType' as 'Ethernet'.\n\nSo the params would be {'podId': '10', 'nodeId': '12', 'fabric': 'Network1', 'interfaceType': 'Ethernet'}. But I need to check if the function's parameters require these. The function's params are a dict, and the description says \"the query parameters for the request.\" So the user's request requires those parameters to filter the data.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call would use the URL with the IP, and the params including podId, nodeId, fabric, and interfaceType. However, the user didn't mention interfaceType, but they want Ethernet stats. Maybe the API defaults to Ethernet if not specified, but to be safe, include it. Alternatively, maybe the endpoint is for interface info in general, and the parameters filter by the node and fabric, and the interface type is part of the data returned. But the user wants Ethernet specifically, so including the interfaceType makes sense.\n\nSo the final function call would be requests.get with the URL and the parameters as specified."}

The function given is requests.get, which requires a URL and parameters. The URL should be the base path without query parameters. The example in the function's description shows something like 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'. Wait, that example has 'api/api'? Maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with what's provided.\n\nThe user's parameters are fabricName: Network1, nodeId: 12, podId: 10, interfaceType: Ethernet, infoType: Speed. These should be included in the query parameters. The URL should replace {ip} with 192.120.45.67.

Let me check if all parameters are required. The function's params are a dict, so I need to include each parameter as a key-value pair. The function's parameters are required, so I need to make sure all the user-provided parameters are included. \n\nWait, the function's params are a single parameter called \"params\" of type dict. So the actual query parameters are part of that dict. So the URL is the base, and the params are the query string. So the function call would have the URL with the IP and the path, then the params include fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, infoType. \n\nI need to make sure the parameter names are correctly spelled and match what the API expects. The user provided Parameter_fabricName, etc., but the actual parameter names are probably without the \"Parameter_\" prefix. So the keys in the params dict should be fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, infoType. The values are Network1, 12, 10, Ethernet, Speed. \n\nSo the function call would be requests.get with the URL filled in with the IP and the path, and the params as the dict with those key-value pairs. Let me double-check the URL path. The example in the function's URL parameter shows 'telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo', so maybe that's correct. The user's API name is \"get information of an interface,\" which seems to align with interfaceInfo in the URL. \n\nI think that's all.

The function has start_available_date and end_available_date. The format needs to be 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. So start_available_date is '2024-03-12 16:00:00' and end_available_date is '2024-03-12 18:00:00'.\n\nOther parameters like district_name and sub_district_name are not provided, so they can be omitted. The function allows optional parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=3, rating=4.5, start_available_date='2024-03-12 16:00:00', end_available_date='2024-03-12 18:00:00'."}

The province is Chiang Mai, which according to the example has province_id 2. The district is Sankampang, so district_name should be \"Sankampang\". The subdistrict is Ton Pao, so sub_district_name is \"Ton Pao\".\n\nThe rating is 4.5, which is a float between 0.0 and 5.0, so that's valid. The other parameters like start_available_date and end_available_date aren't specified, so they can be omitted.
