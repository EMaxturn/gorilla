The user needs an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. The first one requires loc, type, and time. The second one has loc, type, and time (optional). The user provided all three parameters: location, type as 'Plus', and time 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the first function's loc parameter requires 'Street Address, City, State' format, which the user provided exactly. The second function's loc is 'City, State', but the user's address includes the street. However, the user's input has 'Berkeley, CA' as the city and state, but the full address is given. Wait, the user's location is '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which includes the street address. So for uber.ride, the loc parameter is correctly formatted as 'Street Address, City, State'. \n\nBut the second function, uber.ride2, expects loc as 'City, State', but the user provided a full address. However, maybe the user's input is correct, and the function can accept it. But according to the function definitions, uber.ride requires the full address, while uber.ride2 only needs city and state. However, the user's query includes the full address. So perhaps the correct function to use is uber.ride, since it matches the loc parameter's required format. \n\nWait, the user's question says they need a ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which is in the format required by uber.ride. So the correct function is uber.ride. The parameters are loc, type, and time. The user provided all three: loc is the address, type is 'Plus', time is 10. So the function call should be to uber.ride with those parameters. \n\nBut wait, the second function, uber.ride2, has the same parameters except time is optional. But the user provided time. However, the first function requires time. So the correct function is uber.ride. Therefore, the answer should be a call to uber.ride with the given parameters."}

They want the results in text format with a maximum of 10 entries.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the HNA_WQA.search function is for retrieving up-to-date information via web search, which fits here. The parameters needed are keyword, result_format, language, and max_results. The user mentioned the keyword clearly, so that's covered. They want the results in text format, so result_format should be 'text'. The language isn't specified, but since the query is in Korean, maybe default to Korean. Max_results is 10, so set that parameter.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The keyword is required, and others are optional. So the function call should include keyword: '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format: 'text', max_results: 10. Language can be omitted if not specified, but maybe include 'ko' for Korean. Let me check the function's parameters again. The language is optional, so it's okay to leave it out. But the user didn't specify, so maybe it's safer to include it as 'ko' to ensure the results are in Korean. However, the function's description says the search is done using the keyword, so maybe the language is handled by the system. Hmm, but the user's query is in Korean, so setting language to 'ko' makes sense. But the function's parameters don't require it, so maybe it's optional. The user didn't mention language, so perhaps it's better to omit it. Wait, the function's parameters for HNA_WQA.search have 'language' as optional. Since the user's query is in Korean, but the function might default to English. However, the user is asking for information in Korean, so maybe specifying 'ko' is better. But the user didn't explicitly state that. Maybe the function will handle it based on the keyword. Alternatively, since the user is using Korean, the results should be in Korean. So I'll include language: 'ko'.\n\nSo the function call would be HNA_WQA.search with keyword '\uc784\uc9c4\uc65c\ub780', result_format 'text', max_results 10, and language 'ko'. Let me check the parameters again. The HNA_WQA.search function's parameters are keyword (required), result_format (optional), language (optional), max_results (optional). So including all three: keyword, result_format, max_results, and language. That should fulfill the user's request."}

The user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday and wants a congratulatory message sent to him. First, I need to figure out how to get Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions don't include a direct way to look up personal information like birthdays unless it's stored in the core or archival memory.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' for editing core memory, which includes the 'human' section for user details. But the user hasn't provided any information about Shishir Patil in the conversation history, so I can't retrieve his birthday from there. The 'recall_memory_search' function can search through conversation history, but again, there's no mention of Shishir Patil's birthday in the past interactions.\n\nSince the user is asking for a birthday message, maybe they expect me to have that information stored. However, based on the given functions, I don't have access to external databases or the internet to look up birthdays. The 'http_request' function could be used to make an API call, but the user hasn't provided any specific URLs or APIs for that purpose. Without that, I can't retrieve the birthday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the 'send_message' function to send a message, but the problem is knowing the birthday. Since the functions don't allow me to look up external data, I can't proceed. The user might have intended that the birthday is part of the core memory, but since it's not provided, I can't append it. Therefore, I need to inform the user that I can't retrieve the birthday and that I don't have the necessary function to look it up. But wait, the user might have provided the birthday in the initial prompt? Let me check again.\n\nNo, the user's question is separate. The initial system message doesn't include any information about Shishir Patil's birthday. So, I can't use any of the functions to get that data. Therefore, I should respond that I can't find the birthday and can't send the message. But the user might be testing if I can use the 'core_memory' functions. However, since there's no data, I can't. So the correct answer is to point out that the required parameters are missing, specifically the birthday information, and that none of the functions can be used to retrieve it."}

They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview.\n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number 1-523-1713-5704, account type is \"checking\", full name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". The transaction overview would need to include the starting and ending balances, total deposits, withdrawals, and maybe the individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided individual transactions, only totals. \n\nWait, the transaction_overview parameter is a dictionary. The BankStatementOverView function might require that, but the user hasn't given individual transactions. However, the user did mention the starting and ending balances, deposits, and withdrawals. Maybe the transaction_overview can include those totals. But looking at the function's description, it says \"a summary of transactions within the statement period, including totals and counts.\" So perhaps the transaction_overview should be a dictionary with keys like total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, etc.\n\nBut the user has provided all those numbers. So I can structure the transaction_overview as a dictionary with those values. However, the function's parameters might require specific keys. Let me check the parameters again. The transaction_overview is a dict, but the exact keys aren't specified. But the user has provided the necessary data, so I can include them in the dictionary.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters: bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview which includes the starting balance, ending balance, total deposits, total withdrawals.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentioned that they want a summary of transactions. However, the BankStatementOverView function's description says it includes a summary of transactions. So maybe that's covered by the transaction_overview parameter.\n\nBut the user might also need individual transactions. However, the user hasn't provided those details. The question is whether the function can be called with the given data. Since the user provided the totals, maybe the transaction_overview can be constructed with those totals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transaction_summary.generate function is needed to generate the transaction summary. But the user is asking for an overview of the bank statement, which the BankStatementOverView function is designed for. So I think that's the right function to use here.\n\nSo, the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n  \"starting_balance\": 5532.01,\n  \"ending_balance\": 6737.37,\n  \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n  \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40\n}\n\nBut wait, the transaction_overview is a dict, but the function's parameters don't specify the exact keys.

Since the question is about the tech stack in general, maybe including tools is necessary. However, the default might be to include them unless specified otherwise. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps it's safer to set include_tools to true to ensure all relevant techs are included.\n\nThe as_of_date parameter is optional and defaults to the current date. The user didn't specify a date, so we can omit that or use the default. \n\nSo the function call should be get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\" and include_tools set to true. Wait, but the parameter names in the function are employee_id, include_tools, and as_of_date. The user's question doesn't mention tools, but the function's description says it includes tools. Maybe the default is to include them, but to be thorough, setting include_tools to true would ensure that tools are included. \n\nAlternatively, if the default is true, maybe it's not necessary. But since the user is asking for the tech stack, which typically includes both languages, frameworks, and tools, it's better to explicitly set include_tools to true. \n\nSo the correct function call is get_tech_stack with employee_id as \"Adriel\" and include_tools as true. The as_of_date can be omitted since it's optional and the default is current date."}

The parameters required for that function are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and optionally _class.\n\nThe user provided all the necessary details: departure city is New York, NY; arrival is Phoenix, AZ; date is April 23rd, 2023, which I need to format as MM/DD/YYYY, so 04/23/2023. The time is 13:45, which is already in 24-hour format. Number of adults is 1. Trip protection is specified as \"without\", so trip_protection should be false. \n\nI should make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, and trip_protection. All these are provided. The _class is optional, and the user didn't mention it, so I can omit it.\n\nSo the correct function call is Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with the parameters filled in as per the user's request."}

The other parameters are optional. So I should include area as 'Mountain View, CA', intent as 'rent', number_of_beds 2, number_of_baths 1, and in_unit_laundry true. Has_garage isn't mentioned, so maybe leave it out or set to false? But the user didn't specify, so maybe it's better not to include it unless required. The function allows it to be optional.

So the correct approach is to call the function twice with each event type. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the XML, it's a single string. Therefore, the correct answer is to call Events_3_FindEvents twice with each event type. But the user might not have specified the exact type, so maybe the function can handle it.

Wait, the function's parameters are marked as required=false, so I can omit them. But the cast parameter is required? No, the cast parameter is required? Let me check again. The function's params for Movies_3_FindMovies: directed_by, genre, cast are all required=false. So, I can include only the cast parameter. So the function call would be Movies_3_FindMovies with cast set to \"Katsunosuke Hori\". That should retrieve movies where he's in the cast. I think that's the right approach."}

The user wants a Comedy-drama movie directed by Kirill Mikhanovsky. I need to check which function can help here. The available functions are Events_3_FindEvents, Events_3_BuyEventTickets, and Movies_3_FindMovies.\n\nThe Movies_3_FindMovies function seems relevant because it's for retrieving movies based on criteria like director, genre, and cast. The user specified the genre as Comedy-drama and the director as Kirill Mikhanovsky. The parameters for Movies_3_FindMovies include directed_by and genre. The director parameter can take a name, and the genre can be specified. The user's request matches these parameters. So I should call Movies_3_FindMovies with directed_by set to \"Kirill Mikhanovsky\" and genre set to \"Comedy-drama\". The cast parameter isn't mentioned, so I can leave it as default or set to 'dontcare' if needed. But since the user didn't mention cast, maybe it's better to omit it or set to 'dontcare' to include all possibilities. Wait, the parameters are optional, so maybe just provide the ones given. Let me check the function's parameters again. The directed_by is optional, but the user specified it, so include it. Genre is also optional, but the user wants Comedy-drama. So the function call should include both directed_by and genre. The function's enum for genre might have specific values, but the user's input is Comedy-drama, which is a valid genre. So the correct function call is Movies_3_FindMovies with those parameters."}

Let me look at the available functions to see which one can help.\n\nFirst, the functions related to media are Media_3_FindMovies and Media_3_PlayMovie. The Music functions might not be relevant here since the user is asking about movies, not music. The Travel function is about attractions, so that's not it either.\n\nThe Media_3_FindMovies function allows searching by genre and starring actors. The user mentioned \"comic movies,\" which I think refers to movies in the comedy genre. So I should use that function with genre set to \"comedy\". The user didn't specify any particular actor, so the starring parameter can be left as default or set to \"Any\". \n\nWait, the function's parameters are genre (required) and starring (optional). Since the user didn't mention any specific actor, I can omit the starring parameter or set it to \"Any\". But according to the function's description, \"Any\" is an option to indicate no specific preference. So maybe setting starring to \"Any\" makes sense here. But actually, the function's parameters say that starring is required as false, so it's optional. If the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to leave it out. But the function requires genre, which is \"comedy\" in this case. \n\nSo the correct function call would be Media_3_FindMovies with genre \"comedy\". That should return a list of comedy movies. The user didn't mention any specific actor, so no need to include the starring parameter. \n\nI should check if there's any other function that could be relevant, but I don't think so. The other functions are for playing movies, looking up music, or finding attractions. So the answer is to call Media_3_FindMovies with genre set to \"comedy\"."}

That should find songs matching their criteria.\n\nNext, they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me.\" The Music_3_PlayMedia function can play a specific track, but they didn't specify a track title.

Wait, the LookupMusic function's parameters include album, so maybe I can include that as well. But the user didn't specify a track, just the album. Hmm, but the PlayMedia function requires a track. So perhaps first, use LookupMusic to find songs from the album \"Gotta Be Me\" in the Hillbilly genre from 2019. Then, once we have the track names, use PlayMedia with those tracks. But since the user hasn't provided specific track names, maybe the first step is to look up the songs in the album.

So the first function is Music_3_LookupMusic with artist=\"dontcare\", album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\". Then, once the songs are found, use PlayMedia with the track names from the result. But since the user hasn't provided track names, maybe the initial step is to look up the songs.

So first, call LookupMusic with the given parameters, then use PlayMedia with the track from the result. But since the assistant can only call functions, and the user's message is a single turn, maybe the assistant should first call LookupMusic to find the songs, then PlayMedia with the track. However, the user hasn't provided track names, so the assistant needs to first get the list. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\". Then, once that returns the tracks, the next step would be to play them. But in this turn, the assistant can only make one function call. Wait, the user's message is a single turn, so the assistant should make as many function calls as needed. So first, call LookupMusic to find the songs, then PlayMedia with the track. But the user hasn't specified a track, so maybe the assistant needs to first get the list. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters. Then, if the result includes tracks, the next step would be to play them. But the user's current request is to \"hear a song,\" so maybe the assistant should first look up the songs and then play the first one. However, the assistant can only make the function calls. So the first step is to call LookupMusic with the given parameters. Then, once the tracks are found, call PlayMedia with the track name. But since the user hasn't provided track names, the assistant must first get the list. Therefore, the correct function calls are first to look up the music, then play the track. But the user's message is in one turn, so the assistant should make both calls if possible. Wait, the user's message is \"I want to hear a song. I'm in the mood for Hillbilly style from 2019. I had heard that the album Gotta Be Me is really good.\" So the user is asking to play a song from the album Gotta Be Me, Hillbilly style, 2019. So the assistant should first look up the songs in that album, genre, and year, then play them. Therefore, the first function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\". Then, once the list is retrieved, the assistant can call PlayMedia with the track from the result. But since the user hasn't provided track names, the assistant needs to first get the list. Therefore, the first function call is LookupMusic. Then, after that, PlayMedia. But in this turn, the assistant can make multiple function calls. So the answer should include both function calls. However, the user's message is a single turn, so the assistant should make the necessary calls. Therefore, the first function is LookupMusic with the parameters, then PlayMedia with the track from the result. But since the track isn't known yet, the assistant can't call PlayMedia yet. Therefore, the first step is to call LookupMusic. Then, in the next turn, after getting the track names, call PlayMedia. But the user's current turn is to make the request, so the assistant should first call LookupMusic. Therefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album=\"Gotta Be Me\", genre=\"Hillbilly\", year=\"2019\"."}

Since the user is asking to book a reservation, the ReserveRestaurant function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for ReserveRestaurant: restaurant_name, location, time, number_of_seats, and date. The user provided the restaurant name (Balthazar), location (New York), time (8 in the evening), and number of seats (four). The date is \"this Friday,\" which I need to convert to ISO format. \n\nWait, the date parameter requires 'YYYY-MM-DD'. So I need to figure out what date this Friday is. Assuming today's date is October 26, 2023, this Friday would be October 27, 2023. But since the current date isn't provided, maybe I should use a placeholder or check if the user expects a dynamic calculation. However, the function requires a specific date, so I have to determine the correct date based on the current context. \n\nThe time is 8 in the evening, which is 20:00 in 24-hour format.

The available functions are Buses_3_FindBus, Buses_3_BuyBusTicket, Hotels_4_ReserveHotel, and Hotels_4_SearchHotel. Since the user is looking for an itinerary, not a purchase, the Buses_3_FindBus function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Buses_3_FindBus: from_city, to_city, departure_date, num_passengers, and category. The user provided from_city as Fresno, CA, to_city as Los Angeles, and departure_date as March 10th, 2023. The date format needs to be MM/DD/YYYY, so March 10th would be 03/10/2023. The user mentioned they're traveling alone, so num_passengers should be 1. The category is optional, but the user didn't specify any preferences about the bus route category, so maybe we can leave that out or set it to a default. Wait, the parameters for category say it's a string, but the description mentions it's the type of bus route indicating the number of stops. Since the user didn't mention anything about the route category, maybe we don't need to include it. \n\nSo the required parameters are from_city, to_city, and departure_date. The user provided all three. The num_passengers is optional but since they're traveling alone, we should include it as 1. The category is optional, so maybe we can omit it. Therefore, the function call should include from_city: \"Fresno, CA\", to_city: \"Los Angeles, CA\", departure_date: \"03/10/2023\", and num_passengers: 1. The category parameter can be excluded since it's not provided. \n\nI need to make sure the date is formatted correctly. The user said \"10th of march 2023\", which is March 10, so 03/10/2023. The function requires the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. So that's correct. The num_passengers is 1, which is within the allowed range of 1-5. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Buses_3_FindBus with those parameters. No other functions are needed here because the user isn't asking to buy a ticket yet, just to find the itinerary. The other functions are for hotels or purchasing tickets, which aren't relevant here."}

The user wants to book 4 business class train tickets from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA on May 15, 2023, starting one day before, with trip protection.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The functions available are for booking hotels and trains. Since the user is asking about train tickets, the relevant functions are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. But the user wants to book tickets, not just find them, so Trains_1_GetTrainTickets is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection, and _class. \n\nThe user specified \"one day before\" the journey date. The journey date is May 15, 2023, so the start time would be May 14, 2023. But the date_of_journey parameter is for the journey date, which is May 15. Wait, the journey_start_time is the start time of the train journey. If the journey is on May 15, but starting one day before, maybe the train departs on May 14? Or is the journey date the day of departure? Hmm, the date_of_journey is the date of the train journey, so if the user wants to start the journey one day before May 15, that would be May 14. But the user said \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Maybe they mean the journey date is May 15, but the train departs on May 14? That's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the user means that the journey is on May 15, but the train starts one day before, which would be May 14. But the date_of_journey parameter is the date of the journey, so maybe the date is May 15, and the start time is on May 14? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the journey to start on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 14. But the user said \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Maybe they mean the journey is on May 15, but the train departs one day before, which would be May 14. But that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the journey date as May 15, and the train departs on that day, but the start time is one day before? That's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the journey is on May 14, but they said May 15. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the function requires date_of_journey as the date of the journey, so if the user says the journey is on May 15, then that's the date. The start time is the time on that day. But the user says \"starting at one day before\", which might mean the start time is one day before the journey date. Wait, maybe the user wants the journey to start on May 14, but the journey date is May 15. That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the journey date as May 15, and the train departs on that day, but the start time is one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Maybe the user intended the journey date to be May 14, but they wrote May 15. This is a possible error. However, since the user explicitly said \"journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\", I need to parse that. Maybe the journey is on May 15, but the train departs one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible because the journey date is May 15. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the start time as one day before the journey date. So the journey date is May 15, and the start time is May 14. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the user is confused. The function's date_of_journey is the date of the journey, so if the journey is on May 15, then that's the date. The start time is the time on that day. So the user might have meant that the journey is on May 15, and the train departs at a time one day before, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the journey to start on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 14. But the user said May 15. This is a bit of a problem. However, given the user's wording, I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as the time on that day. But the user said \"starting at one day before\", which might mean the start time is one day before the journey date. Wait, maybe the user is saying that the journey is on May 15, but the train starts one day before, which would be May 14. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the start time as one day before the journey date. For example, if the journey is on May 15, the start time is May 14. But that's not possible. I think there's a misunderstanding here. However, since the function requires the date_of_journey as the date of the journey, and the journey is on May 15, I'll use that. The journey_start_time would be the time on May 15. But the user said \"starting at one day before\", which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the journey to start on May 14, but the date_of_journey is May 14. But the user said May 15. This is a bit of a problem.

Wait, the function parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets require journey_start_time as a required parameter. The user hasn't provided the time, so this is a missing parameter. But the user's question says \"starting at one day before\", which might be a clue. If the journey is on May 15, starting one day before would be May 14. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the journey starts on May 14, but the date is May 15. This is unclear. However, since the user hasn't provided the time, perhaps the assistant should assume a time or point out the missing parameter.

They need a cleaning service provider in Bangkok's Chatuchak district available on March 22, 2024, with a good reputation.\n\nFirst, I should check the available functions. The get_service_providers function seems right here. It allows filtering by location, availability, and service type. The user mentioned \"good reputation,\" which probably translates to a high rating. The avg_rating parameter can be set to 4.5 or 5.0. \n\nNext, the location: Bangkok is the province, so province_id should be 1. The district is Chatuchak, so district_name is \"Chatuchak\". The availability is March 22, 2024. The start_available_date should be '2024-03-22 00:00:00'. Since the user didn't specify an end date, maybe leave end_available_date as null or not include it. \n\nThe service type is cleaning, so service_id might be 1 (assuming that's the ID for cleaning). Also, the user wants a good reputation, so setting avg_rating to a high value makes sense. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. The function requires some parameters, but not all are mandatory. So, including province_id, district_name, start_available_date, and service_id, along with avg_rating for reputation. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention anything about age, quality problems, or other filters. So those parameters can be omitted. Also, check if the date format is correct. The start_available_date should be in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format. Since the user said \"available on the 22nd of March, 2024\", maybe the time is not specified, so setting it to 00:00:00 is acceptable. \n\nSo the function call should include province_id=1, district_name=\"Chatuchak\", start_available_date=\"2024-03-22 00:00:00\", service_id=1, and avg_rating=4.5.

The status_filter parameter can be set to \"active\" to get only active sites. The include_metadata is optional, but since the user didn't specify needing metadata, maybe it's better to include it for completeness. Wait, the user just wants the list of active websites, so maybe include_metadata can be set to true to get more details if needed. But if the user doesn't mention metadata, perhaps it's safer to leave it as default. However, the function's parameters have include_metadata as a boolean, and the desc says it's to include creation date and last updated. Since the user didn't ask for that, maybe it's better to not include it unless required. But the function's required status for include_metadata is false, so it's optional. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants the list of websites, so using get_websites with status_filter=\"active\" would be sufficient. The other function, website_configuration_api.WebsiteConfigurationApi.get_website, requires a websiteId, which the user hasn't provided. So that's not needed here. The third function is about service configurations, which doesn't seem relevant here. \n\nSo the correct function to call is get_websites with status_filter set to \"active\". The include_metadata parameter is optional, but since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to not include it unless necessary. Wait, the function's parameters have include_metadata as optional. If the user wants all the configured websites, maybe the default is to include metadata. But the problem is that the user hasn't specified whether they need metadata. However, the function's description says that include_metadata is to specify whether to include metadata. Since the user's request is to \"provide me with all the actively configured websites\", the minimal required is the list of websites, so maybe the include_metadata can be set to false. But the default might be true or false. Wait, the function's parameters don't specify a default value, so if not provided, it's up to the function's implementation. However, the user might not need metadata, so perhaps it's better to set include_metadata to false. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is to include metadata, so leaving it out would include it. But since the user hasn't asked for metadata, maybe it's better to set include_metadata to false. However, the user might not know what metadata is, so including it might be better. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants the list of websites, so the get_websites function with status_filter=\"active\" is sufficient. The include_metadata can be left out, and the function will return the basic info. So the correct function call is get_websites with status_filter set to \"active\". That should retrieve all active websites. The other functions don't seem relevant here. So the answer is to call get_websites with status_filter=\"active\"."}

Looking at the functions provided, the 'add_service_config' function is the one that adds a new service configuration. The parameters required are 'service_name' and 'configurations', which is a dictionary of key-value pairs.\n\nThe service name is clearly 'fdsa'. The configurations need to include the timeout, retry count, endpoint, and authentication. The authentication requirement might need a specific key, maybe 'authentication_required' set to true.

Then there's get_shareable_api_tokens, which is for custom dashboards. The user didn't mention anything about dashboards, so maybe the first one is the right choice.\n\nThe user's ID is given as \"user123\", which is a string. The get_api_tokens function expects a string for user_id, so that's good. The include_expired parameter is optional, but since the user is trying to remember all tokens, maybe they want expired ones included. But the user didn't specify, so maybe default to false. Wait, but if they forgot the tokens, maybe they want all, including expired? Hmm, but the function's include_expired is a boolean. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the function will return all tokens by default. Wait, the function's parameters say include_expired is optional and required is false. So if not provided, it might default to false. But maybe the user wants all, so maybe set include_expired to true? Or maybe the default is false. The description says \"include expired tokens should be included in the response\" if the flag is set. So if the user wants all tokens, including expired, they need to set include_expired to true. But the user hasn't specified that. However, since they forgot the tokens, maybe they need to see all, including expired ones. But the function's parameters don't have a default value, so maybe the API expects it to be optional. So the assistant should call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and maybe include_expired as true? Or leave it out? The problem is that the user hasn't specified whether they want expired tokens. But the function's parameters don't have a default, so maybe the API will return all tokens by default. Wait, the function's description says that include_expired is a flag to determine if expired tokens should be included. So if not provided, maybe it's false. But the user might need to see all tokens, including expired ones. However, since the user hasn't specified, maybe the function should be called without include_expired, and the API will return the default, which might not include expired. But the user is trying to remember all tokens, so maybe they need to include expired ones. But the user hasn't specified, so the assistant can't assume. Therefore, the correct approach is to call get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired as true? Or maybe not. Wait, the user is asking to \"remind\" them of the tokens. If the tokens are expired, they might not be valid anymore. But the user might still want to see them. However, the function's parameters don't have a default for include_expired, so the assistant should probably include it as true to get all tokens. Alternatively, maybe the API defaults to not including expired ones. But the user might not know that. So the safest way is to call the function with include_expired set to true to ensure all tokens are retrieved. But the user hasn't specified that. However, the function's parameters don't have a default, so the assistant must include it. Wait, the parameters for get_api_tokens have include_expired as required=false, so it's optional. Therefore, the assistant can choose to include it or not. But since the user is trying to remember all tokens, maybe the assistant should set include_expired to true. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the API will return all tokens by default. But the function's description says that include_expired is a flag to determine if expired tokens are included. So if the user doesn't set it, the API might not include expired ones.

However, the user is asking to \"remind\" them of the tokens, which might include expired ones. Therefore, the correct function call is get_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired set to true. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the active ones.

Therefore, the function call would be:\n\n{\"function\":\"api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens\",\"parameters\":{\"user_id\":\"user123\",\"include_expired\":true}}\n\nBut wait, the user's user_id is \"user123\", which is a string.
