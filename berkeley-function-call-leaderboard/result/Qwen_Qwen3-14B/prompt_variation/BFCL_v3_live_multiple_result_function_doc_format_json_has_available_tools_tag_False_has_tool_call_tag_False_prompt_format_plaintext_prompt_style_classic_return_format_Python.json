The user wants an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. I need to check which function to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's uber.ride and uber.ride2. \n\nFor uber.ride, the parameters required are loc, type, and time. The loc needs to be a street address with city, state. The user provided that exact address. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. Time is 10 minutes. So that fits.\n\nThen there's uber.ride2. It requires loc (city, state), type, and time. The user's loc is a street address, but ride2's loc example is 'Berkeley, CA' without the street. The user's input has the full address, so maybe ride2 isn't suitable here because it's expecting a city and state, not a street address. Also, ride2 has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, so that's okay. But since the loc format doesn't match, ride2 might not be the right choice.\n\nSo the correct function is uber.ride with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. The other function's loc parameter doesn't accept street addresses, so it's not applicable here."}

So the location parameter should be \"Ha Noi, Vietnam\". I need to call api.weather with that loc value. The other function is for Uber rides, which isn't relevant here.

However, the function doesn't have a KO option. Hmm, maybe the default is okay, or maybe the user is okay with English results.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find Shishir Patil's birthday. The functions available include searching archival memory and recall memory. Since the user didn't provide the birthday info, I should check the archival memory first. Use archival_memory_search with the query \"Shishir Patil birthday\" to see if there's any stored info.\n\nIf that doesn't return the birthday, maybe check recall memory using recall_memory_search with the same query. But the user might not have a conversation history, so archival is more likely. If I can't find the birthday, I can't proceed. But assuming the search finds it, then I can use send_message to congratulate him. The recipient would need an email or phone number, but the user didn't specify. Maybe default to the default recipient in send_message, but the user might expect a specific one. Wait, the parameters for send_message have a default recipient of 'default@example.com', but maybe the user expects it to be sent to Shishir Patil's actual contact. However, since the user didn't provide that info, I can only use the default. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to know it, but I can't assume. So if the birthday is found, send the message with the default recipient. But the user might have intended for it to be sent to Shishir directly, but without his contact info, I can't. So the steps are: search archival, get birthday, then send message with default recipient. If no birthday found, inform the user. But the user's question is to find the birthday and send a message.

The user wants an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for October 2019. They provided the account number, name, beginning and ending balances, total deposits and withdrawals. They also want a transaction summary.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions can be used. The BankStatementOverView function seems right. It requires bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user mentioned \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\" as the account name, so account_type is checking. The bank name is U.S. Bank. Account number is given. Full name might be from the company info, but the user didn't provide it. Wait, the user didn't mention the company name or the full name of the account holder. The function requires full_name. Hmm, but the user might have provided the company name in the account name? Not sure. Wait, the account name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\", which might be the account type, not the company name. The user might need to provide the full name, but they didn't. Maybe the function can proceed without it? No, the parameters are required. Wait, looking back, the parameters for BankStatementOverView have required fields: bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, transaction_overview. So full_name is required. But the user hasn't provided that. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, the user's message says the account is under the name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. Maybe that's the full name? Or is that the account type? The account type is checking, and the name might be the company name. Wait, the user might have provided the company name as part of the account name. But the full_name parameter in the BankStatementOverView function is the account holder's name. The user hasn't provided that. So maybe there's a missing parameter here. But the user might have intended that the account name is the company name. Alternatively, maybe the collect_customer_names function can be used to get the full name, but the user hasn't provided first or last names. \n\nWait, the user hasn't given the customer's name. So maybe the full_name can't be determined. But the user is asking for the overview, so perhaps the full_name is required. Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the function can't be called. But the user might have intended that the account name is the full name. Alternatively, maybe the company name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. But the function's full_name is the account holder's name, which might be different from the company name. \n\nThis is a problem. The required parameters for BankStatementOverView include full_name, which the user hasn't provided. So maybe the assistant can't proceed without that. However, the user might have provided the company name in the account name. Wait, the user says the account is under the name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. That might be the company name, but the full_name is the individual or entity's name. If the account is under the company name, then maybe the full_name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the full name is missing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_company_info function can be used to retrieve the official name. But the user hasn't provided the company name. The get_company_info requires company_name as a parameter. The user hasn't given that. \n\nSo, there's a missing parameter here. The full_name is required for BankStatementOverView, but the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the function can't be called. However, the user might have intended that the account name is the full name. Let me check the user's message again. The user says: \"The account number is 1-523-1713-5704, and it's under the name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING.\" So \"under the name\" might refer to the account type or the company name. If the account is under the company name SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING, then maybe the full_name is that. But the function's full_name is the account holder's name, which could be the company name. So perhaps the full_name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\". \n\nAssuming that, then the parameters for BankStatementOverView would be:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n    total_deposits: 7132.76,\n    total_withdrawals: 5927.40,\n    start_date: \"2019-10-01\",\n    end_date: \"2019-10-31\"\n}\n\nAlso, the starting_balance and ending_balance are given, but the BankStatementOverView function doesn't require those parameters. Wait, looking at the parameters for BankStatementOverView, the required fields are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, transaction_overview. The starting and ending balances are not part of the parameters for this function. So the user's starting and ending balances might not be needed here. \n\nBut the user also wants a summary of transactions. The transaction_summary.generate function requires transactions array, starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance, firstname, lastname. But the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so that function can't be called unless we have the transactions data. However, the user hasn't provided the list of transactions, so that function can't be used. \n\nWait, the user says \"Could you also include a summary of transactions for this period?\" So maybe the Alltransactions function can be used to retrieve the list of transactions for the statement period. The Alltransactions function requires the statement_period in 'YYYY-MM' format. The period is October 2019, so '2019-10'. The include_pending parameter is optional, default False. So calling Alltransactions with statement_period='2019-10' would get the transactions. Then, using that data, the transaction_summary.generate function could be called with the transactions array, along with the other parameters. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the assistant would need to first call Alltransactions to get them. However, the user's question is to provide an overview, which includes the transaction summary. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Call Alltransactions to get the list of transactions for October 2019.\n2. Use that data to generate the transaction summary with transaction_summary.generate, along with the other parameters like starting_balance, ending_balance, etc.\n3. Call BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters, assuming full_name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\".\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the full_name, which is required. So the assistant might need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name. \n\nSo, the first function call would be Alltransactions to get the transactions. Then, using those transactions, call transaction_summary.generate. Also, call BankStatementOverView with the assumed full_name. However, the user hasn't provided the full_name, so the assistant might need to proceed with the available info, even if it's an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the full_name is missing, the assistant can't call BankStatementOverView. But the user might have intended that the full_name is the company name. \n\nSo, proceeding with the assumption that full_name is \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\", the BankStatementOverView function can be called. Then, the Alltransactions function to get the transactions, and then the transaction_summary.generate with the transactions array and other parameters. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the individual transactions, so the assistant would need to first retrieve them via Alltransactions. However, the user's question is to provide the overview, which includes the transaction summary. Therefore, the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls in sequence."}

However, since the user didn't specify, maybe we should stick to the default unless told otherwise. But maybe the user expects tools to be included. Hmm, but the function's default for include_tools is False. So unless the user specifies, we should use the default. However, the user might not know that the default is False. But according to the function's parameters, include_tools is optional and defaults to False. So the function call would be get_tech_stack(employee_id=\"Adriel\"). \n\nWait, the parameters required are employee_id, which is provided. The other parameters are optional.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants tools included. But since the default is False, and the user didn't specify, it's better to use the default. So the answer is to call get_tech_stack with employee_id=\"Adriel\"."}

The Restaurants_2_FindRestaurants function seems right here. The parameters required are category, location, price_range, has_vegetarian_options, and has_seating_outdoors. The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which probably maps to the price_range parameter. Looking at the enum options for price_range: cheap, moderate, pricey, ultra high-end. Intermediate might be 'moderate' since that's the default. The user also wants outdoor seating, so has_seating_outdoors should be set to True. The location is New York, but the function requires 'City, State' format. The user just said New York, so maybe 'New York, NY' is the correct format. The category isn't specified, so maybe leave it as default? Wait, no, the category is required. Wait, the parameters for FindRestaurants have 'category' as required. But the user didn't specify a cuisine type. Hmm, that's a problem. The function requires the category, but the user hasn't provided it. So maybe I need to ask for clarification? But the user's question doesn't mention a category. Wait, the original question says \"tagged as intermediate priced for cost\" and \"include outdoor seating areas in New York.\" So maybe the category isn't specified, but the function requires it. That's an issue. But maybe the user is okay with any category as long as the price and seating are met. However, the function requires the category parameter. So perhaps I need to use a default or make an assumption. Wait, looking back at the function definition: the 'category' parameter is required, and the enum includes options like Mexican, Bistro, etc. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I can't proceed without that information. But the user might not know the category. Wait, maybe the user is okay with any category, but the function requires it. So perhaps the assistant should point out that the category is missing. However, the user's instruction says if the parameters are missing, point it out. But in this case, the user hasn't provided the category, which is required. So the correct response would be to indicate that the category is missing. However, maybe the user intended to leave it open, but the function requires it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default value, but the function doesn't have a default for category. So the assistant can't proceed without that parameter. Therefore, the answer should note that the category is missing. Wait, but the user's question is to find restaurants with intermediate price and outdoor seating. The category isn't specified, so the assistant can't call the function without it. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. However, looking back at the problem statement, the user says \"if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" So in this case, the required parameters for FindRestaurants are category and location. The user provided location (New York), but not category. So the assistant should point out that the category is missing. But the user might not have specified it. However, the assistant is supposed to make the function call if possible. Wait, but the function requires category. So the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the category is missing. But the user's original question didn't mention a category. So the assistant can't make the call without that. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the category is missing. However, maybe the user intended to search for any category, but the function requires it.

Looking at the Travel_1_FindAttractions function, it retrieves attractions in a specified city, filtered by entry fee, category, and suitability for kids.\n\nThe parameters required are location, and optional ones like free_entry, category, and good_for_kids. The user mentioned \"park\" as the category, so I should set category to 'Park'. They also want it suitable for children, so good_for_kids should be 'True'. The entry fee is not a concern, so free_entry can be 'dontcare'. The location is Toronto, so I need to format that as 'Toronto, Canada' probably. \n\nLet me check the parameters again. The location is required, and the function's parameters include location, free_entry, category, good_for_kids. So the call should be Travel_1_FindAttractions with location='Toronto, Canada', category='Park', good_for_kids='True', and free_entry='dontcare'. That should get the user the desired parks."}

The user wants to find songs similar to those on the album 'The New Classic' and also explore tracks released around six years ago, considering the current year is 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions are Music_3_PlayMedia and Music_3_LookupMusic. Since the user is asking to find similar songs and tracks from a specific time, Music_3_LookupMusic seems appropriate. The PlayMedia function is for playing a track, which isn't needed here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for Music_3_LookupMusic, it accepts artist, album, genre, and year. The user mentioned the album 'The New Classic', so I should set the album parameter to that. They also want songs similar to those on the album, which might relate to the genre. However, the genre parameter's default is 'dontcare', so maybe leaving it as default would allow the function to consider the album's genre. But the user didn't specify the genre, so perhaps it's better to leave it as 'dontcare' unless the album's genre is known. Since the function doesn't automatically infer genre from the album, I should stick with the given parameters.\n\nNext, the user wants tracks released around six years ago. Since the current year is 2023, six years prior would be 2017. The year parameter in the function has an enum that includes '2017', so I should set the year to '2017'. The 'around' part might mean considering 2016-2018, but the function's year parameter is specific. The user might need to check multiple years, but the function allows only one year at a time. However, the user might not mind checking 2017 specifically. \n\nSo, the parameters would be album: 'The New Classic' and year: '2017'. The artist and genre can be left as default 'dontcare' since the user didn't specify them. \n\nWait, the function's required parameters are none, so it's okay to just provide album and year. That should cover both criteria: similar songs (via album) and release year. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album='The New Classic' and year='2017'."}

The relevant ones here are Trains_1_GetTrainTickets and Trains_1_FindTrains. But the user is asking to book a ticket, so probably Trains_1_GetTrainTickets is the one to use. Let me check the parameters for that function.\n\nThe parameters required for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are: _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. Also, there's an optional _class parameter with a default of 'Value'.\n\nThe user provided all the necessary parameters: _from is New York, NY, to is Phoenix, AZ, date_of_journey is April 23rd, 2023, which should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY, so 04/23/2023. The journey_start_time is 13:45, number_of_adults is 1, and trip_protection is False. The _class isn't specified, so it will default to 'Value'.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are present. The user mentioned all of them. So the function call should be Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with those parameters. The date format is correct, and the time is in 24-hour format. The number_of_adults is 1, which is allowed. Trip_protection is a boolean, so setting it to False. \n\nI don't see any missing parameters here. So the correct function call is to use Trains_1_GetTrainTickets with the given details."}

They mentioned concerts or plays, so the event_type should be either Music or Theater. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the Events_3_FindEvents function, it requires event_type, city, and optionally date. The parameters fit here. The city is Las Vegas, and the date is 2023-03-06. The event_type can be set to 'Music' and 'Theater' separately, but the function allows only one event_type at a time. Wait, the user wants both concerts and plays. Hmm, maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. But the function's parameters have event_type as a single string, not a list. So perhaps the user's request covers both, but the function can only handle one at a time. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept multiple types, but according to the parameters, it's a single string. So I'll have to make two separate calls: one for Music and one for Theater. But the user might want both types. Let me check the function's parameters again. The event_type is a string with enum values Music and Theater. So each call can only handle one type. Therefore, to cover both, two function calls are needed. However, the user might be okay with combining the results. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a list, but according to the given parameters, it's a single string. So I'll proceed with two calls. But the user's question is to find events like concerts or plays, so both types. Therefore, I need to call Events_3_FindEvents twice, once with event_type 'Music' and once with 'Theater', both with city 'Las Vegas' and date '2023-03-06'. Alternatively, maybe the function allows using 'any' for event_type, but no, the required parameters are event_type and city. So the correct approach is two separate function calls. However, the user might not have specified the exact event type, but wants both. So the answer would be to call the function for each type. But the system might require individual calls. So the correct function calls would be:\n\nEvents_3_FindEvents(event_type='Music', city='Las Vegas', date='2023-03-06'), Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Theater', city='Las Vegas', date='2023-03-06')\n\nBut the user might not have specified the exact date format. The date parameter is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so March 6th, 2023 is '2023-03-06'. The city is 'Las Vegas', but the parameter allows 'City' or 'City, State'. Since Las Vegas is in Nevada, maybe 'Las Vegas, NV' is better. However, the function's city parameter says it can be 'City' if no state. But to be precise, using 'Las Vegas, NV' would be better. However, the user just said 'Las Vegas', so maybe the function can handle it either way. But the parameter description says 'City, State' or 'City' if no state. So 'Las Vegas' is acceptable. So the function calls would be as above."}

The user specified \"music concert or a play,\" so event_type can be either \"Music\" or \"Theater.\" The city is New York, and the date is March 10th, which should be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' so '2023-03-10' assuming the current year.

But the function might not support multiple types in one call. Hmm, but the user said \"preferably a music concert or a play,\" so maybe they are open to either. However, the function might need to be called twice, once for each type. But the user might expect both in one go. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle multiple types if passed as a list, but according to the parameters, event_type is a single string. So perhaps the assistant should make two separate calls. But the user's question is a single query. Wait, looking back at the function definition: the event_type parameter is a string with enum ['Music', 'Theater'], so it's a single value. Therefore, to cover both possibilities, maybe the assistant should call the function once with event_type 'Music' and once with 'Theater'. However, the user might not have specified which one they want, so perhaps the assistant should check both.

Let me confirm the parameters. The function requires city, which is provided, and date is optional but the user specified it. So the correct call is Weather_1_GetWeather(city=\"Antioch, CA\", date=\"2023-10-01\")."}

They want to hear a song in the Hillbilly style from 2019, and they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" is good.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The Music_3_LookupMusic function can search for songs based on artist, album, genre, and year. The parameters include genre, which has an enum that includes 'Country' but not 'Hillbilly'. However, 'Hillbilly' is a subgenre of Country, so maybe using 'Country' as the genre is the closest match. The user specified 2019 for the year and the album \"Gotta Be Me\". \n\nThe user didn't mention a specific artist, so I'll leave that as 'dontcare'. The genre should be set to 'Country' since 'Hillbilly' isn't an option. The album is specified, so I'll include that. The year is 2019. \n\nOnce the lookup is done, the user probably wants to play the song. The Music_3_PlayMedia function can play a track, but it requires the track name. Since the lookup might return multiple songs, maybe the user needs to select one. However, the current functions don't support selecting a specific track from the lookup results. The user might need to be informed that after looking up, they can choose a track to play. But according to the instructions, I should only return function calls. So first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. If the response includes a track, then use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track name, artist, and device. But since the user hasn't specified the track name yet, maybe just the lookup is needed first. However, the user's main goal is to hear a song, so maybe after looking up, the system would handle playing it. But the functions don't have a direct link. So the correct step is to first call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', album 'Gotta Be Me', year '2019', and artist 'dontcare'. Then, once the lookup returns a track, use PlayMedia. But since the user hasn't provided the track name, maybe the assistant should first perform the lookup and then prompt the user to choose a track. However, the current task is to generate the function calls based on the user's input. Since the user hasn't specified the track name, the PlayMedia function can't be called yet. Therefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters genre='Country', album='Gotta Be Me', year='2019', artist='dontcare'."}

The user wants to book a table for four at Balthazar in New York this Friday at 8 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the necessary functions are available. There's the ReserveRestaurant function. Let me look at its parameters. It requires restaurant_name, location, time, date, and number_of_seats (with a default of 2). \n\nThe user provided the restaurant name as Balthazar, location is New York, time is 8 PM, date is this Friday. The number of seats is four. \n\nWait, the date needs to be in ISO format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user said \"this Friday\", but the current date isn't specified. However, the function might handle relative dates, but the parameter expects a specific date. Since the user didn't provide the exact date, maybe I should use the current date to calculate this Friday. But since the system might not have real-time data, perhaps the user expects the function to handle it. However, the function's parameters require a specific date string. \n\nWait, the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday\", but the function requires an ISO date. Since the current date isn't given, maybe the assistant should proceed with the information given, assuming that \"this Friday\" is the intended date. However, the function might need an actual date. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the assistant should proceed with the available info, even if it's not fully specified. Alternatively, the assistant might need to ask for the exact date. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"this Friday\", but the function requires a date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. Since the current date isn't provided, the assistant can't compute the exact date. Therefore, the parameters are missing. However, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the given info, assuming that the user will input the correct date. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. \n\nWait, the user's message says \"this Friday at 8 in the evening\". The date is not given as a specific ISO string. So the required parameter 'date' is missing. Therefore, the function call can't be made because the date isn't specified. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday\", but the function requires a specific date. Therefore, the assistant should note that the date is missing. But the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. However, the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday\", but the function requires a specific date. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without that info. \n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use the current date to calculate this Friday. However, since the system doesn't have access to real-time data, it can't determine the current date. Therefore, the assistant can't compute the exact date.

However, according to the problem's instructions, if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the date is missing. However, looking back at the function's parameters, the 'date' is a required parameter. So the assistant can't proceed without it. \n\nBut the user's message says \"this Friday\", which is a relative date. The assistant might need to convert that into an absolute date. However, without knowing the current date, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed and should inform the user that the date is missing. However, the problem says that if the parameters are missing, the assistant should point it out. Therefore, the answer would be that the date is missing. \n\nBut the user might have intended to provide the date as \"this Friday\", but the function requires a specific date.

Let me re-read the question: \"for the journey on May 15, 2023 starting at one day before\". Maybe \"starting at one day before\" refers to the date being May 14? But that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the start time is one day before the original date? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to say the journey is on May 15, and the start time is, for example, 8:00 AM. But since the user didn't specify, we can't proceed. Therefore, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are missing journey_start_time. So the function can't be called. However, maybe the user intended to provide the date as May 15, and the start time is not specified, but the function requires it. Therefore, the answer would be that the parameters are missing. But the user might have made a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey is on May 15, and the start time is not specified, so we can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the journey_start_time is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide that, but it's not in the question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the journey starts on May 15, and the date_of_journey is May 15, and the journey_start_time is not provided. Therefore, the function can't be called. So the answer would be that the required parameter journey_start_time is missing. \n\nBut the user's question says \"starting at one day before\"\u2014maybe that's a mistake and they meant the journey starts on May 15, but the start time is not specified. Therefore, the function call can't be made because the journey_start_time is required. So the answer would be that the parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the time, but it's not in the question. \n\nIn conclusion, the required parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets are _from, to, date_of_journey, journey_start_time, number_of_adults, trip_protection. The user provided _from (Portland, OR), to (Seattle, WA), date_of_journey (May 15, 2023), number_of_adults (4), trip_protection (True), and _class (Business). But journey_start_time is missing. Therefore, the function can't be called because journey_start_time is required. So the answer is that the required parameter journey_start_time is missing."}

The district_name should be Chatuchak. The start_available_date needs to be set to 2024-03-22. Since they mentioned a good reputation, maybe the avg_rating should be set to a higher value, like 4.0 or above. But the parameters allow using null for unrated, but since they want a good reputation, specifying a higher average rating makes sense. However, the function's parameters don't have a direct 'reputation' field, so avg_rating is the closest. Also, service_id for cleaning service is 1. Let me check the enum for service_id: yes, 1 is cleaning. So I'll set service_id=1. The other parameters like has_quality_problem, has_late_check_in can be left as default (False) to ensure they don't have issues. Maybe also check if is_cleaning_home is True, but the user just said cleaning service, which might cover home, condo, or office. But since they didn't specify, maybe leave those as default. So the parameters would be province_id=1, district_name='Chatuchak', start_available_date='2024-03-22 00:00:00', avg_rating=4.0, service_id=1.
