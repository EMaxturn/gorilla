There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user wants to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". The foodItem is Caesar salad. The default for newIngredients is empty, so maybe they don't want to add anything. So the function call would be ChaFod(foodItem=\"Caesar salad\", removeIngredients=\"anchovies\").\n\nThen for the drink, the ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences should include size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The user wants large size, hot temperature, regular sweetness, and almond milk. So the new_preferences dict would have size='large', temperature='hot', sweetness_level='regular', milk_type='almond'. The default for size is medium, so we need to set it to large. Similarly, temperature default is cold, so set to hot. Sweetness_level default is regular, so stays. Milk_type default is regular, but user wants almond, so set to almond. Special instructions are optional, but the user didn't mention any, so leave as default.\n\nSo the drink function call would be ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id=\"123\", new_preferences={\"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"sweetness_level\": \"regular\", \"milk_type\": \"almond\"}).\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly set. The user didn't mention any special instructions for the drink, so they can be omitted. The food item is changed to Caesar salad without anchovies. The drink is updated as specified. Both functions are called correctly with the required parameters."}

The parameters required are location, category, and language. For the first request, Paris, France. The location parameter needs to be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. Since France doesn't have a state abbreviation, it should be 'Paris, France'. The category is general by default, but the user wants technology, so I need to set category to 'Technology'. Language is English, which is 'en' by default, so that's already covered.\n\nFor the second request, Letterkenny, Ireland. The location here is 'Letterkenny, Ireland' since it's a city in Ireland. The category is again 'Technology' as specified, and language is 'en'. So I need to call get_news_report with location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en'.\n\nI need to make sure that both function calls are correctly formatted. The first one would be get_news_report(location='Paris, France', category='Technology', language='en') and the second one get_news_report(location='Letterkenny, Ireland', category='Technology', language='en'). \n\nWait, the default for category is 'General', but the user wants technology, so explicitly setting it to 'Technology' is necessary. Also, the language is already 'en' by default, but specifying it again is safe. \n\nSo the two function calls should be made. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so no need to adjust anything else. I think that's all."}

The user has provided a series of steps to perform on a repository. Let me break down each step and see which functions I can use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and optionally the destination. Since the user provided the URL, I'll need to call clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL. The destination is defaulting to the current directory, which is fine unless specified otherwise. So the first function call would be clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git').\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to analyze the repo contents and create a Dockerfile. The analyse_repo_contents function takes a directory_name. But the user hasn't specified a directory name yet. Wait, the repo is cloned into the current directory, so maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. However, the function requires the directory name as a parameter. Since the user hasn't provided a specific directory, perhaps the default is used. But the function's parameters require directory_name, which is a required parameter. Hmm, maybe the user expects that the cloned repo is in the current directory, so the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. But the function's parameters don't mention the repo's path, just the directory name. Wait, the function's description says the directory_name is the name of the repository directory where the Dockerfile will be created. So if the repo is cloned into the current directory, then the directory_name would be the cloned repo's path. But the user hasn't specified that. Wait, the user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis.\" So maybe after cloning, the directory is the cloned repo's path. So the directory_name would be the path where the repo is cloned, which is the current working directory. But the function's parameters require directory_name, which is a string. So perhaps the user expects that the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. But since the user hasn't provided a specific directory name, maybe the default is used. However, the function requires directory_name as a required parameter. So I need to call analyse_repo_contents with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path. But the user hasn't specified that. Wait, the user's step 2.1 is part of the same process. Maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's path, which is the current directory. So the function call would be analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')? Wait, the repo URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, but the directory name for the analysis would be the cloned repo's path. But the user hasn't specified that. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's path, which is the current directory. But the function requires the directory_name as a parameter. So perhaps the user expects that the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the default is used. However, the function's parameters require it. So I need to make sure that the directory_name is provided. But the user hasn't specified it. Wait, the user's step 2.1 is part of the same process. Maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. So the function call would be analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')? Or maybe the directory_name is the path where the repo is cloned, which is the current directory. But the function's parameters require a specific directory name. This is a bit unclear. Maybe the user expects that the directory_name is the cloned repo's path, which is the current directory. But the function requires a specific name. Maybe the user intended that the directory_name is the cloned repo's path, so the function call would be analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')? Or perhaps the directory_name is the path where the repo is cloned, which is the current directory. But the function's parameters require a string. So maybe the user expects that the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the default is used. However, the function requires it. So I need to make a call. Maybe the directory_name is the cloned repo's path, which is the current directory. But the function's parameters don't mention that. This is a bit of a problem. Alternatively, maybe the directory_name is the name of the cloned repo, which is 'nodejs-welcome'. So the function call would be analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nThen, step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAML files based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name. Again, the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. So the same directory_name as before. So the function call would be create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nNext, step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name, and the commit message and branch name. The user hasn't specified the commit message or branch name, so the defaults are used. The commit message defaults to 'Update changes', and the branch name is 'main'. So the function call would be push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False).\n\nWait, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is handled by the push_git_changes_to_github function. The function's description says it pushes all changes from the local repo to GitHub. So that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention creating a Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function is for generating a Dockerfile, but the analyse_repo_contents function is for analyzing the repo. So after analysing, the Dockerfile is created. But the create_a_docker_file function's parameters require the directory_name. So the steps would be:\n\nAfter cloning, analyse_repo_contents, then create_a_docker_file, then create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\nBut the user's steps 2.1 and 2.2 are to create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. So the functions would be:\n\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome') to get the analysis.\n\nThen create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome') to create the Dockerfile.\n\nThen create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome') to create the YAMLs.\n\nThen push the changes.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\nanalyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\ncreate_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\npush_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)\n\nBut wait, the user's step 3 is to add all changed files to git changes, which is handled by push_git_changes_to_github. The function's parameters include directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The defaults are commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False.\n\nSo the function calls are as above.\n\nBut I need to check if the functions are correctly called. For example, the create_a_docker_file function is called after analyse_repo_contents, which is correct. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file is called after that as well.\n\nSo the final function calls would be:\n\n[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)]"}

The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so I need to check if 'CellResult' is part of the repository. The function 'get_relevant_classes' is available, which searches the repository for classes matching a search string. The user wants to include subdirectories, so the parameter 'include_subdirectories' should be set to True.\n\nNext, the user needs the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters required are 'class_name' and 'method_name'. Since the user is working in Java, the 'language' parameter should be 'Java'.

The units here are in centimeters, but the function just needs the numerical value, so that's straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a location. The user provided \"Queenstown Singapore\", which is the correct format as per the function's parameters. The function also has a 'unit' parameter with default 'fahrenheit', but since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default. So I need to call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown Singapore\" and unit='fahrenheit' (or leave it as default).\n\nWait, the function's parameters require 'location' as a string, and the example shows 'San Francisco, CA' or 'Paris, France'. So \"Queenstown Singapore\" is acceptable. The unit is optional, so if not provided, it defaults to Fahrenheit. The user didn't mention the unit, so I'll stick with the default.\n\nSo both functions are needed here. The user asked for both, so I need to call both functions.
