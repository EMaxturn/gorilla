Since we are only asking for one region (United States) and one platform (PlayStation), we can directly get the price.\n\n But the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. Since we are only querying one specific store (PlayStation in the US), there should be only one price. Therefore, we don't need to compare multiple results.\n\n However, let's note:\n - The function `video_games.store_price` requires:\n      game_title: string\n      platform: string\n      region: string (optional, default to United States)\n\n We are given:\n      game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n      platform: 'PlayStation'\n      region: 'United States' (which is the default, so we can omit or include)\n\n Since the region is optional and we are using the default, we can call without region, but to be explicit we can set it.\n\n But note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for that specific store and region. There is no function to get multiple prices at once. So we are only getting one price.\n\n Therefore, we can simply call:\n      video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\n However, the question says \"cheapest\", which might imply we need to compare with other platforms or regions? But the question specifies \"in the PlayStation Store in the United States\". So it's only one store and one region.\n\n Hence, we can directly get the price.\n\n But wait: what if the game is sold at multiple price points in the same store? (e.g., standard edition, deluxe edition). The function `video_games.store_price` does not specify an edition. Therefore, we must assume that the function returns the lowest price available for that game in that store? Or it returns the base game price? The function description does not specify.\n\n Since the user asks for the cheapest selling price for the game, and we are constrained by the function, we can only get one price. We have to assume that the function returns the base game price or the lowest available price.\n\n Alternatively, the function might return multiple editions? But the return type is not specified in the function parameters. Looking at the function definition, it doesn't say. However, the description says \"the selling price\", which might imply one price.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will assume that the function returns the base game price or the only available price. If the store lists multiple editions, we might need a different approach, but our available functions don't support that.\n\n Therefore, we call the function with the given parameters.\n\n However, note: the function `video_games.on_sale` might be relevant for a discount, but the question is about the selling price, which might already include sale prices. The function `video_games.store_price` should return the current selling price, which would be the discounted price if on sale.\n\n So we can directly call `video_games.store_price`.\n\n Let's write the function call:\n\n<functions>\n<function name=\"video_games.store_price\">\n    <param name=\"game_title\" type=\"string\">Assassins Creed Valhalla</param>\n    <param name=\"platform\" type=\"string\">PlayStation</param>\n    <param name=\"region\" type=\"string\">United States</param>\n</function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the region parameter is optional and defaults to United States. So we could omit it. However, the user specifically asked for the United States, so including it is safe.\n\n Alternatively, if we are concerned about the function not returning multiple editions, we might have to consider that we cannot get the cheapest among editions with the current functions. Therefore, we proceed with the call.\n\n However, the question asks for the \"cheapest\" selling price. If the store has multiple editions, we would need to get all the prices and then pick the minimum. But our function set does not have a way to get all editions. Therefore, we must rely on the function to return the base price or the lowest available price.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function `video_games.store_price` might return a structure that includes multiple editions? But the function parameters do not specify an edition. The function description does not say. So we have to assume it returns one price.\n\n Since the question is specific to the PlayStation Store in the US, and we have one function call that returns one price, we make that call.\n\n Therefore, the function call above is appropriate.\n\n However, let me check the function definitions again:\n\n The function `video_games.store_price` has parameters: game_title, platform, and region (optional). It returns the selling price. The return type is not specified, but we assume it is a numeric value.\n\n So we output the call as above."}
