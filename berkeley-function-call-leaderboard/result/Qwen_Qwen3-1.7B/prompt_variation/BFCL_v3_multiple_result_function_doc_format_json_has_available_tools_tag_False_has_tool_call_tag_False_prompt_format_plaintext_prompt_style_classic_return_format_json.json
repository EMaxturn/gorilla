There's video_games.on_sale, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which gets the selling price. The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might show if it's on sale, but the user wants the actual price. However, the store_price function gives the current price. But the question is about the cheapest selling price. Maybe the store_price function returns the current price, which is the cheapest. But I need to confirm if that's the case. The user might be looking for the lowest price, but the functions provided don't have a function to find the lowest price. The store_price gives the current price, which is the latest sale price. So perhaps the answer is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region.\n\nSo the parameters would be game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform: 'PlayStation', region: 'United States'. The function store_price would return the current price. The user might not know that the store_price is the current price, but based on the functions given, that's the only way to get the price.

The parameters for geometry_rectangle are width and length, both integers. The user provided both values, 7 and 10. So I should call the geometry_rectangle.calculate function with those parameters. The other functions are for square and circle, which don't fit here. No missing parameters, so the function call should be correct."}

Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about calculating the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The parameters required are distance, time, and initial_speed. The user provided distance as 20 meters, time as 4 seconds, and initial_speed is 0.

The calculate_speed_from_rest function is designed for this exact scenario. \n\nSo, I need to call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info. The function should return the final speed. \n\nI don't see any other functions that would be relevant here.

Where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'calculate_final_temperature' which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2. The parameters required are all present in the user's question. The user provided 2 moles at 300 K and 3 moles at 400 K.

The parameters required are 'elements' and 'order'. The user specified ascending order, so the order parameter should be 'asc'.\n\nThe elements provided are ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], which are all strings. The sort_list function's description says it sorts strings in ascending order by default, so even if the order is set to 'asc', it should work. But to be safe, I'll include the order parameter explicitly.\n\nSo the function call should be sort_list with elements as the list and order as 'asc'. No other parameters are needed.

Its parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The user mentioned two dice, so n_rolls would be 2. The sides_per_die is usually 6 for standard dice. The desired_sum is 7. The function requires desired_sum and sides_per_die, which are provided. The n_rolls is optional but here it's necessary to set to 2. So I should call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. The other parameters are optional and have defaults, but since the user specified two dice, we need to include n_rolls. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly set. Yes, that should do it."}

The dividend_data function seems relevant because it's specifically for dividend payments. The parameters required are company, years, and frequency. The user mentioned Apple Inc and five years, so company is Apple Inc, years is 5. The frequency is not specified, but the default is annually. So I should call dividend_data with company as \"Apple Inc\" and years as 5. The stock_market_data is for stock data, not dividends, so that's not needed here.

The question is about veterans, which is a demographic category. The get_demographics function's description mentions retrieving demographic data including categories like gender, race, age. Veterans might be part of that category. \n\nThe parameters required for get_demographics are year and category. The user provided the year 1954 and the category would be \"veterans\". So I should call get_demographics with year 1954 and category \"veterans\". \n\nWait, but the user might be referring to the total veterans or a specific group. However, the function's parameters don't specify that, so I have to assume that \"veterans\" is the correct category.

The parameters required are 'room' and 'period'. The user mentioned living rooms, so the room parameter is covered. The period is optional, but the user is asking for the current trend. The default for the period is 'Daily', but the function's enum includes 'Daily', 'Weekly', 'Monthly', 'Yearly'. Since the user didn't specify a time frame, using the default 'Daily' makes sense. \n\nSo, I should call 'paint_color.trends' with room set to 'Living room' and period as 'Daily'.

Let me check its parameters. The required parameters are initial_velocity and time.

The user specified $20000 as the initial investment, 8% annual rate, and 5 years. They didn't mention any contributions, so contribution is 0 by default. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required ones are initial_investment, rate_of_return, and years. The user provided all three, so I can call the function with those values. The contribution is optional, so it's safe to omit it. \n\nSo the function call should be finance.calculate_future_value with initial_investment=20000, rate_of_return=0.08, years=5.

So 30 feet times 12 feet equals 360 square feet. \n\nNext, the coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. To find out how many gallons are needed, I divide the total area by the coverage rate. So 360 divided by 400 equals 0.9 gallons. \n\nBut wait, paint usually requires whole gallons, so maybe they need 1 gallon. However, the function calculate_paint_needed might handle this calculation precisely. The parameters required are coverage_rate, length, and height.

The parameters required for find_exhibition are location, art_form, and optionally month and user_ratings. The user specified New York as the location, modern sculpture as the art form, and the upcoming month. The user also mentioned \"top rated,\" which probably corresponds to the user_ratings parameter. The default for user_ratings is 'high', which would mean high-rated exhibitions. \n\nSo, I should call find_exhibition with location set to 'New York', art_form set to 'modern sculpture', and since the month is upcoming, maybe the default month parameter is sufficient. The user didn't specify a particular month, so the default should be okay. \n\nThe other functions, like card_game_probability.calculate, don't relate to exhibitions, and get_sculpture_info is for retrieving specific sculptures by artist, which isn't what the user is asking for. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to call is find_exhibition with the specified parameters. I need to make sure all required parameters are included. The required parameters are location and art_form, which are both provided. The month is optional but since the user said \"upcoming month,\" the default should be used. \n\nSo the function call should be find_exhibition with location: 'New York', art_form: 'modern sculpture', and user_ratings: 'high' to ensure top-rated exhibitions. Wait, the user_ratings parameter's enum is ['low', 'average', 'high'], and the default is 'high', so even if not specified, it's already high.
