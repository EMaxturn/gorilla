The 'order' defaults to 'asc' if not specified, which is what the user wants.

Hmm.\n\nBut according to the function's parameters, 'order' is not required. So the function can be called with just elements. However, the user's instruction says to sort in ascending order, so maybe the order is needed. But since the default is 'asc', it's okay.

But the user's question says to sort in ascending order, so maybe the order is needed. But since the default is 'asc', it's not necessary.

The get_population function's category can be \"veterans\".
