Wait, but the parameters are in the function's params. The initial_velocity is a boolean? No, the param type for initial_velocity is integer, but the user says initial velocity is zero.

In SQL, combining conditions with AND usually requires using a WHERE clause. But the function's parameters expect an array of conditions. So maybe the conditions array should have two elements: one for age and one for job. Like [ { age: 26 }, { job: 'engineer' } ]?

It needs desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional, default 6). The user is asking for two rolls of a six. So desired_number is 6, number_of_rolls is 2. The die_sides is 6, which is the default, so maybe I don't need to specify it. But the function requires die_sides to be optional, so including it might be better to be explicit.

The location is New York, the genre is pop, and the date is next month. But wait, the date parameter expects a string. How do I represent next month? Maybe use \"next month\" as the date parameter. Let me check the function's parameters again. The date is a string, so I can input \"next month\" as the date. So the function call would be concert_info.get with location=\"New York\", date=\"next month\", genre=\"pop\". That should retrieve the needed information."}

The location isn't mentioned, so I can leave that out since it's optional.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The team_name, num_of_games, and league are all required, and they're provided.

Wait, the user didn't specify the language, so maybe just leave it out. But the function's parameters say language is required? No, the required field is false. So it's optional.
