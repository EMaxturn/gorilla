The parameters provided by the user are all there: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, 5 seconds. No rounding specified, so maybe leave that out. I need to call the displacement function with these values.

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price in the US, I need to call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as United States. The on_sale function checks if it's on sale, but the question is about the cheapest price, which might involve checking if it's on sale and then the price. However, the user specifically mentions the selling price, so maybe store_price is sufficient. But wait, if the game is on sale, the store_price might return the discounted price. So I should call store_price with the given parameters. The region is specified as United States, so I'll include that. The parameters are game_title, platform, and region.

The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I should call that function with those parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here.

The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance and time, which are given as 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional but since it's starting from rest, I can include it as 0. \n\nSo, I should call calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. That should compute the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, requires initial and final speeds and time, which I don't have here.

Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of thermal energy. The formula is (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2), where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters.

So if I include that, it should filter exhibitions with high user ratings. The month is optional, but since the user mentions \"upcoming month,\" maybe the default is set to return upcoming events. But the function's month parameter says the default returns upcoming events. So even if I don't specify the month, it should work.
