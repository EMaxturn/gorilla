The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The user provided the height as 150 meters and mentioned the initial velocity is zero. The gravity isn't specified, so I should use the default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, the parameters would be height=150, initial_velocity=0, and gravity=9.81. Since the initial velocity is zero, that's the default, but the user explicitly stated it, so I should include it. Gravity is the default, but maybe it's better to specify it anyway for clarity.

However, the function's assumeMajor parameter is set to true by default, so it will assume the key is major unless told otherwise. \n\nBut the presence of 'vi' might suggest that the key could be minor. However, since assumeMajor is true, the function will try to find a major key that fits the progression. Let me think: in a major key, the vi chord is minor.
