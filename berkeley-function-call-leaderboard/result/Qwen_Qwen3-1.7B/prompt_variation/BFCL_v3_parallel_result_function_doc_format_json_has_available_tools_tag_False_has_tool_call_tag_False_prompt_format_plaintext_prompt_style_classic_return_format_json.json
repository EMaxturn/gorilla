But the parameters for movie are an array, so perhaps the user can pass both movies in the same call. But the time parameter is an array of show times. The user wants Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm. So the time array would need to include both times. But the function's time parameter is an array of show times.

So for each movie, the user would need to specify the location, the movie (as an array), and the time (as an array).

However, the user's question is to find two theatres, so perhaps the function can be called twice. But the function's parameters are set up to take each movie and time separately.

So, I need to take the result from the first step (which should be 15) and compute HCF(15, 90, 120). Wait, but the function is called hcf, so I need to call it again with the new numbers. Wait, no, the function is for two numbers. So, after getting 15, the next step is HCF(15, 90) and then HCF(15, 120). But the user says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair\", so maybe they want HCF(15, 90, 120) but since the function only takes two numbers, I need to do two separate calls. Wait, but the function is for two numbers. So, first HCF(15, 90) and then HCF(15, 120). But the user might be expecting a single call, but the function can't handle three numbers.

So, first HCF(36,48) which is 12, then HCF(12,72) and HCF(12,96). Again, two separate calls.\n\nSo, the plan is to call the math.hcf function four times: once for each pair.

Wait, but the user's question is to find the HCF of (45,60), then use that result with (90,120), then find HCF of (36,48), then use that result with (72,96). So maybe the steps are:\n\n1.

So the first call is for 45 and 60, then the next call is for 15 and 90, then 15 and 120, then 36 and 48, then 12 and 72, then 12 and 96. So that's six function calls.
