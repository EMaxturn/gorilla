The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height is given as 150 meters. The initial velocity is specified as zero, so that's provided. The gravity parameter has a default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2, which is Earth's gravity.

The user wants to search for ongoing lawsuits related to Google filed after January 1, 2021, in California.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function provided is lawsuit_search. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are company, start_date, and location. The status is optional with a default of 'ongoing'.\n\nThe user specified 'ongoing' lawsuits, which matches the default status. So I don't need to include the status parameter unless the user wants a different status. Since they mentioned 'ongoing', it's safe to omit it, but including it explicitly might be clearer. However, the function's default is already 'ongoing', so it's optional.\n\nThe company is Google, start_date is after January 1, 2021. The date format required is MM-DD-YYYY. So January 1, 2021 would be 01-01-2021. The location is California, which is the full state name, so that's correct.\n\nWait, the user said \"after January 1, 2021\". Does that mean the start_date should be 01-01-2021 or later? The function's start_date is the start of the date range. So if they want lawsuits filed after that date, maybe the start_date should be set to 01-01-2021 and the end_date implied? But the function parameters don't have an end_date. The function only has start_date. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to search for lawsuits filed on or after the start_date. The user said \"after\", so perhaps the start_date should be 01-01-2021, and the function will handle it as >= that date. But the exact interpretation depends on the function's implementation. Since the user specified \"after\", maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021? Wait, no. If the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be 01-01-2021, and the function might be designed to include that date. But the user might mean strictly after, so maybe the start_date should be 01-02-2021. However, without knowing the function's exact behavior, I have to go with the parameters as given. The user's instruction says \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be set to 01-01-2021, assuming that the function's start_date is inclusive. Alternatively, maybe the function allows for a range, but since only start_date is provided, perhaps it's the earliest date to search from. The user might need to adjust the date, but based on the given info, I'll use 01-01-2021 as the start_date.\n\nSo the parameters would be company: \"Google\", start_date: \"01-01-2021\", location: \"California\", and status: \"ongoing\". But since status is default, maybe it's optional. However, the user explicitly mentioned \"ongoing\", so including it might be better to ensure clarity.\n\nWait, the function's status parameter is optional with a default of 'ongoing'. So if the user says \"ongoing\", we can omit it. But including it might be redundant but correct. However, the user's query includes \"ongoing\", so maybe it's better to include it to be explicit. But the function's default is already 'ongoing', so including it is optional. The function call can include it or not. Let me check the parameters again. The status is required=false, so it's optional. So the function call can be made with company, start_date, location, and optionally status. Since the user specified \"ongoing\", including it would make the parameters explicit. However, the default is already 'ongoing', so it's not necessary. But maybe the user wants to ensure that only ongoing cases are considered, so including it is better.\n\nSo the final function call would be:\n\nlawsuit_search with company=Google, start_date=01-01-2021, location=California, status=ongoing.\n\nBut wait, the start_date format is MM-DD-YYYY. So January 1, 2021 is 01-01-2021. Correct.\n\nSo the parameters are all there. The required parameters are present. The status is optional but included here. So the function call is valid."}

Let me check the available functions. There's get_song_lyrics which requires song_title and artist_name. Both are provided here: song title is \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and artist is Queen. The lang parameter is optional, defaulting to English, which should be fine. So I need to call get_song_lyrics with those parameters. No missing info, so the function call should work."}

The user is asking about the music theory chord progression function. They provided the progression ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'] and want to identify the key signature.\n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters required for the function. The function requires the progression as an array, which the user has given. There are two optional parameters: returnAllPossibleKeys and assumeMajor. The user didn't specify these, so I should use the defaults. The default for returnAllPossibleKeys is false, meaning it returns the first valid key. AssumeMajor is true by default, so the function will assume a major key unless told otherwise.\n\nThe chord progression given is I, V, vi, IV. Let me think about common progressions. In a major key, the vi chord is minor. For example, in C major, the vi chord is Am. But the progression here includes IV, which is major. Wait, in C major, IV is F major. So the progression I (C), V (G), vi (Am), IV (F). That's a common progression, like in \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" or other songs. The key here would be C major. But the function should determine that based on the chords.\n\nSince the function is called with the default assumeMajor=true, it will check for major keys first. The presence of the vi chord (which is minor) in a major key is possible because vi is the relative minor of the major key. So the key would be the major key whose relative minor is the vi chord. Wait, no. In a major key, the vi chord is the relative minor. For example, in C major, the vi chord is Am, which is the relative minor. So if the progression includes vi, that's consistent with the major key. The IV chord is major, which is the subdominant in a major key. So the key here is likely C major. But the function will calculate that based on the chords provided.\n\nSo the function call should be made with the given progression and default parameters. The user didn't specify any other parameters, so no need to include them. The answer should return the key signature, which in this case is C major."}

The user provided all three: team_name is Manchester United, num_of_games is 6, and league is Premier League. There's no mention of location, so that's optional. I don't need to include location since it's not required. So the function call should have those three parameters.
