I can use this to search for \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\n- archival_memory_search: This performs a semantic search in archival memory. It might also be useful, but recall_memory_search seems more appropriate for conversation history.\n\nOnce I have the information, I need to send a message: send_message function can be used to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to Shishir.\n\nThe user says \"regardless\", meaning I should send the message even if I don't find the birthday info. So, I need to handle both cases.\n\nMy response should only include function calls in the specified format. I need to chain functions if necessary.\n\nStep 1: Search for the birthday info.\n\nI should call recall_memory_search with a query like \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nAfter searching, if I get results, I might need to process them, but since I'm an AI that only outputs function calls, I can't process results directly.

For horizontal flip, I can use flip_direction='horizontal'.\n\nThe user wants both actions: rotate and flip.\n\nI should call both functions. The system prompt says I can make one or more function calls in my response.\n\nFormat: I MUST use the exact format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)...]\n\nI need to ensure I have all required parameters:\n\n- For rotateImageAction: degrees=20 (required). The other params are optional, so I can omit them if not specified.\n\n- For flipImageAction: flip_direction='horizontal' (required).\n\nThe user didn't specify any additional details like image format or keeping original, so I'll just use the required ones.\n\nOrder: The user said \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally.\" It might imply sequence, but since these are separate functions, I'll call them in the order mentioned.\n\nIn my response, I should only include the function calls, nothing else.\n\nSo, my response should be: [rotateImageAction(degrees=20), flipImageAction(flip_direction='horizontal')]\n\nIs there any dependency? For example, does one need to be applied after the other? The functions don't specify any state, so I'll assume they operate on the current image independently.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So, I'll call both in this response.\n\nFinally, confirm if all parameters are provided: Yes, for both functions, the required params are given in the user's request."}

Hotels_2_SearchHouse: For searching houses, not events.\n\nSo, the appropriate function is Events_3_FindEvents.\n\nNow, let's check the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents:\n\n- event_type: Required. The category of the cultural event. The user mentioned \"music or theater events\", so I need to handle that. The function might expect a single string, like \"music\" or \"theater\". But the description says \"The category of the cultural event.\" I might need to call it once for each if it's not clear, but the function doesn't specify multiple types. For now, I'll assume I can use a general term or choose one. To be precise, I should use what's available. The user said \"music or theater\", so perhaps I can call it twice, once for each.\n\nThe function is designed to find events based on one event_type per call. The param is singular: event_type.\n\nThe user is asking for events in San Diego, CA on March 1st, 2023.\n\n- city: Required. \"The name of the city where the event is happening, formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City' if state not available. For example, 'New York, NY' or 'Paris'.\"\n\n  So, for San Diego, CA, it should be 'San Diego, CA'.\n\n- date: Optional. \"The date of the event, formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If not specified, any date is considered.\"\n\n  The user specified March 1st, 2023, which is '2023-03-01'.\n\nFor event_type, I need to provide a string. The user said \"music or theater\". I could make two calls: one for \"music\" and one for \"theater\", since the function might return different results for each.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI can output multiple function calls in one response.\n\nSo, I should call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once with event_type=\"music\" and once with event_type=\"theater\".\n\nIs \"music\" and \"theater\" the exact terms? The function description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so \"music\" might map to concerts, and \"theater\" to plays.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nParameters for each call:\n\nFirst call: event_type=\"music\", city=\"San Diego, CA\", date=\"2023-03-01\"\n\nSecond call: event_type=\"theater\", city=\"San Diego, CA\", date=\"2023-03-01\"\n\nMy response should only include the function calls in the specified format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, something like: [Events_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"music\", city=\"San Diego, CA\", date=\"2023-03-01\"), Events_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"theater\", city=\"San Diego, CA\", date=\"2023-03-01\")]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIs there any missing parameter?

The category of the cultural event. The user mentioned \"music concerts or theater plays\", so I need to specify this. It could be \"music\" for concerts or \"theater\" for plays. The function might allow a general type, but I have to choose one. The description says \"The category of the cultural event\", so I might need to make it specific. Since the user said \"or\", I could call it once for each, but the system says to try to complete in the current turn, so I'll start with one.\n\n- city: Required. The name of the city, formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. For Los Angeles, it should be 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- date: Optional. The date of the event in 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The user specified March 10th, 2023, so that's '2023-03-10'.\n\nThe user wants both music concerts and theater plays.

The function description says \"The category of the cultural event\", and examples aren't specified, but for concerts, \"music\" might work, and for plays, \"theater\" or \"play\".\n\nAssuming that's fine, I'll proceed.\n\nThe response format must be exactly: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]\n\nNo other text.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n[Events_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"music\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\"), Events_3_FindEvents(event_type=\"theater\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\")]\n\nThat seems appropriate.\n\nOne potential issue: Is \"theater\" the correct event_type? It might be \"theatre\" or something else, but based on common usage, I'll go with \"theater\".\n\nAlso, ensure the city format: 'Los Angeles, CA' \u2013 that matches the description.\n\nDate: '2023-03-10' for March 10th, 2023. Yes.\n\nI think that's all. No missing parameters."}
