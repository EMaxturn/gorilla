We must pass both movies and both times in arrays.\n\n But note: the function description says it finds theatres and schedule for a specific movie. However, the parameters allow an array of movies and an array of times.\n\n Since the user wants theatres that have both showings (one for Tenet at 5pm and the other for No Time To Die at 7:30pm), we can pass both movies and both times.\n\n However, note: the function might be designed to search for one movie at multiple times? But the description says \"for a specific movie\". But the parameter 'movie' is an array and the enum has both. So we can pass both.\n\n But the requirement is to find theatres that have both movies at the specified times? The function might not necessarily require both to be at the same theatre? The user says \"two movie theatres\", meaning two different theatres? Or one theatre for each?\n\n Let's read the user request: \"Find two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\"\n\n It could be interpreted as:\n   Option 1: Two theatres, one showing Tenet at 5pm and the other showing No Time To Die at 7:30pm.\n   Option 2: Two theatres, each of which must have both showings? That seems less likely because the user specified two different movies at two different times.\n\n But note: the user says \"with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\". The \"and\" might be connecting the two requirements for the same set of theatres? However, the request says \"two movie theatres\", so it is asking for two different theatres.\n\n Since the function does not specify whether it returns theatres that have all the movies at the specified times or any of them, we must rely on the function's behavior. However, we are only allowed to call the function as provided.\n\n Given the parameters, we can pass:\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n But note: the function's 'movie' parameter is an array of strings from the enum. We are passing both.\n\n However, the function might return theatres that have either movie at the specified time? Or it might return theatres that have both? The description does not specify.\n\n Since the user wants two theatres (each having one of the movies at the specified time) or perhaps one theatre having one and another having the other, we can call the function with both movies and both times and then in the result we can look for two theatres that each have one of the movies at the time? But note the function returns theatres and their schedule for the specified movies.\n\n Alternatively, we might need to call the function twice: once for Tenet at 5pm and once for No Time To Die at 7:30pm? But the function allows multiple movies and times. However, the function does not have a parameter to specify which time corresponds to which movie. So if we pass two movies and two times, how does it know which time is for which movie? It might be that it returns showings for each movie at any of the times? That would be ambiguous.\n\n Given the ambiguity, it might be better to make two separate calls? But the function signature does not allow that because the 'movie' is an array and the function is designed to take an array. However, the function does not specify how the times are matched to movies.\n\n Since the problem is ambiguous and we must use the function as provided, we have to assume the function expects the same number of movies and times and that the i-th movie corresponds to the i-th time? But the function description does not say that.\n\n Alternatively, the function might be designed to return all showings for the given movies at any of the given times? That would be more flexible.\n\n However, the user's request is very specific: Tenet at 5pm and No Time To Die at 7:30pm. We want two theatres that can cover these two showings (each theatre might have one or both). But the user asks for two theatres, so we are probably looking for two different theatres each having one of the showings? Or one theatre having both? But the user says \"two movie theatres\", meaning two distinct theatres.\n\n Since we don't know the exact behavior of the function, we must use the function as designed. We'll call it once with both movies and both times and hope that the function returns theatres that have at least one of the requested showings. Then we can pick two distinct theatres that together cover both showings? But note: we are only allowed to generate the function call, not process the results.\n\n Therefore, we must make a single call with the parameters:\n\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n But note: the function requires all three parameters. We are providing them.\n\n However, the user wants two theatres. The function does not have a parameter for the number of theatres. We can only hope that the function returns at least two.\n\n Alternatively, the function might return multiple theatres? We assume it does.\n\n So we generate:\n\n   find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"])\n\n But note: the function expects the time as an array of strings. We are passing two times.\n\n However, the function does not specify the format of the time string. We are using the user's format: \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\".\n\n But what if the function expects 24-hour time? We don't know. We must use the format that the user provided because that's what the function description does not specify otherwise.\n\n Also note: the user said \"near San Diego\", so we are using \"San Diego, CA\" as the location.\n\n Since the function call requires all three parameters and we are providing them, we can make the call.\n\n However, note that the user wants two theatres. The function does not have a parameter to limit the number of results. We assume the function returns multiple theatres.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   [find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"])]\n\n But wait: the user wants two theatres. We are only making one call. The function might return multiple theatres. We are not asked to process the results, just to make the call.\n\n Alternatively, if we are allowed to make multiple calls, we could call for each movie separately? But the function does not have a parameter for the number of theatres. And the user wants two theatres. We can try to get two theatres by making two calls? But the function does not have a parameter to specify the number of theatres to return.\n\n However, the function might return a list of theatres. We are only required to generate the function call. We assume the function will return multiple theatres and then we can pick two in the next step? But we are not doing the next step.\n\n Since the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response\", and we are to do our best with one or more function calls, we can make one call that gets the data for both movies and both times. Then, in the system's next step, it can process the results to pick two theatres.\n\n But note: the user wants two theatres. We cannot specify that in the function call because the function doesn't have a parameter for that.\n\n Therefore, we make one call.\n\n However, there is another interpretation: the user might want two theatres, each showing one of the movies at the specified time. We can make two separate calls:\n\n   Call 1: for Tenet at 5pm -> location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"]\n   Call 2: for No Time To Die at 7:30pm -> location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"]\n\n Then we get two sets of theatres: one set for Tenet and one for No Time To Die. Then we can pick one theatre from each set? \n\n But note: the function allows an array of movies and an array of times. We don't know if it can handle one movie and one time per call. But the parameters are arrays, so we can pass one-element arrays.\n\n This approach might be better because it avoids the ambiguity of matching multiple movies to multiple times. Also, the function description says \"for a specific movie\", so maybe it was intended for one movie? But the parameter is an array. So it can handle multiple.\n\n However, the user's request is for two distinct movies at two distinct times. If we make two calls, we get two lists of theatres. Then we can choose one theatre from the first call and one from the second.\n\n Since the user wants two theatres, and we are making two calls, we can do:\n\n   [find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"]), find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"])]\n\n But note: the function requires the parameter 'time' as an array. We are passing an array of one string.\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n Which approach is better? \n\n Approach 1 (one call) might return theatres that have both movies at the given times? But we don't know if the function matches the movie and time by index. If it does, then we are asking for Tenet at 5pm and No Time To Die at 7:30pm? But the function might not require the same theatre to have both? It might return any theatre that has Tenet at 5pm OR No Time To Die at 7:30pm? That would be a union.\n\n Approach 2 (two calls) would get theatres for Tenet at 5pm and separately for No Time To Die at 7:30pm.\n\n The user wants two theatres: one for Tenet and one for No Time To Die. So two calls would give us two separate lists. Then we can pick one theatre from the first list and one from the second.\n\n Therefore, I choose two calls.\n\n However, note the function does not have a parameter to limit the number of results. We don't know how many theatres it returns. We assume it returns multiple. We are only required to generate the function calls.\n\n So we generate two function calls.\n\n Format: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\n Let's write:\n\n   find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"])\n   find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"])\n\n But note: the function name is 'find_movie_showing'. We are calling it twice.\n\n We must write in the exact format: [find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"]), find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"])]\n\n However, note: the function requires the parameters in the order? But in Python, keyword arguments can be in any order. But to be safe, we can follow the order in the function definition? But the function definition does not specify an order for the parameters. We'll use the order: location, movie, time.\n\n But the function definition in the JSON has: location, movie, time.\n\n So we write:\n\n   [find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"Tenet\"], time=[\"5 pm\"]), find_movie_showing(location=\"San Diego, CA\", movie=[\"No Time To Die\"], time=[\"7:30 pm\"])]\n\n However, note: the function parameter 'time' is an array of strings. We are passing an array with one string.\n\n This should be acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we could pass both in one call? But then we would get a combined list of theatres that have either showing. Then we would have to group by theatre? But we are not processing the results. And the user wants two theatres: one for each movie. So two calls are more straightforward.\n\n Therefore, we generate two function calls."}

The user is asking for quantities as well.\n\n Let's check the function parameters: it only requires paint_type and color.\n\n Since the function does not have a parameter for quantities and the description does not mention returning quantities, we must assume that the function as defined does not provide quantities.\n\n However, the problem states: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\"\n\n We have two options:\n   a) We can still call the function for the two colors and hope that the function's return includes quantities in its description? But the function specification does not say so.\n   b) We note that the function does not support quantities and thus we cannot fulfill that part.\n\n But wait: the function's return structure is not defined in the parameters.

We are not given the return type.\n\n However, the function is described as: \"Gives a combination of primary colors to mix for creating a certain color.\"\n\n The problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\"\n\n We must use the function we have. We cannot change the function. We are to generate function calls.\n\n The user asks for two things:\n   - magenta with watercolor (including quantities)\n   - navy with acrylic (including quantities)\n\n The function does not have a way to specify that we want quantities. But note: the function might inherently return the mixture including quantities? We don't know.\n\n Since we don't have a function that explicitly takes or returns quantities, and we are constrained to use the given function, we must call the function as it is and hope that the function's implementation returns the required information (including quantities) in its result.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the function is insufficient. However, the instruction says: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\"\n\n We have a function that can take the paint_type and color. The missing part is the quantity. But the function does not require quantity as input. And the function might output the quantity? We are not told.\n\n Since we are required to produce function calls and we don't have a better function, we will call the function for the two requests.\n\n But note: the function does not have a parameter for quantity. Therefore, we cannot pass quantity. We can only pass paint_type and color.\n\n So we will call:\n   paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta')\n   paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')\n\n However, the user also asked for \"quantities\". We are not sure if the function returns that. But we have no other function to call.\n\n We must generate the function calls as per the available function.\n\n Important: The problem says \"Return only the function calls in your response\". So we output the two calls.\n\n But note: the function specification says it returns a combination. It might be that the combination includes the proportions? We don't know. We can only rely on the function to provide that.\n\n If the function does not return quantities, then the user's request for quantities will not be fully met. However, that is a limitation of the function.\n\n Since we are only allowed to use the given function, we proceed.\n\n Format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(...)]\n\n We note that the function name is 'paint_color_mixture'. We call it twice.\n\n Let's write the calls:\n\n First call: paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta')\n Second call: paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')\n\n But note: the user said \"navy\" for acrylic. However, the function requires the color as a string. We must use the exact string as provided by the user? Or should we adjust?\n\n We are to use the user's input: \"navy\" and \"magenta\".\n\n Also note: the paint_type must be one of: Watercolor, Oil, Acrylic. The user said \"watercolor\" and \"acrylic\". We must use the exact string as defined? The function expects the string to be one of those. We can use:\n\n   For the first: paint_type='Watercolor' (with capital W? The function doesn't specify case, but typically we follow the given examples. The example in the function description uses \"Watercolor\", \"Oil\", \"Acrylic\". So we use the same.\n\n   Similarly, for the second: paint_type='Acrylic'\n\n However, note: the function expects the paint_type to be a string. We are using the same as the example.\n\n So the two calls:\n\n   paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta')\n   paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')\n\n But wait: the user said \"navy\", so we use 'navy' (without quotes in the function call, but in the representation we use a string).\n\n However, note: the function call representation in the output should be in the exact format.\n\n We write:\n\n   [paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta'), paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')]\n\n But note: the function call is a string representation. We must follow the format: [func1(params), func2(params)]\n\n However, the example format uses the function name and then the parameters in parentheses with named parameters.\n\n We are generating two separate function calls.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"one or more function/tool calls\". So we can have two.\n\n Let's output:\n\n   [paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta'), paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')]\n\n However, note: the function might not know the color 'navy'? We don't know. We are passing what the user said.\n\n We are not told of any restrictions on the color string. So we pass as is.\n\n If the function does not support a color, that will be handled by the function.\n\n We are only generating the calls.\n\n But note: the user asked for quantities. We are not passing any parameter for quantity because the function doesn't have it. We are also not getting it from the function? We don't know. We are just making the call.\n\n We must trust that the function returns the mixture including quantities? Or maybe it doesn't. We have no way to get quantities otherwise.\n\n Since we have no function that returns quantities, we can only use the available function.\n\n Therefore, we output the two calls.\n\n However, note: the function might return a structure that includes the colors and their proportions? We don't know the return type. We are not given. We are only making the call.\n\n We are following the instruction: we are using the available function.\n\n If the function does not return quantities, then the user's request for quantities will not be met. But that is a limitation of the function set.\n\n Therefore, the output is:\n\n [paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta'), paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')]\n\n But wait: there's a typo? The user said \"navy\", so we write 'navy'. And in the second call, the paint_type is 'Acrylic'? The function expects one of the three: Watercolor, Oil, Acrylic. The user said \"acrylic\", so we use 'Acrylic' (with capital A and without the extra 'l'?).\n\n Actually, the function description says: \"The type of paint (Watercolor, Oil, Acrylic).\" So we must use 'Acrylic'. The user said \"acrylic\", but we map to the defined string.\n\n Also, note: the first call uses 'Watercolor' (with capital W) and the second uses 'Acrylic' (with capital A).\n\n We are using the exact strings as provided in the function's description.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n   [paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Watercolor', color='magenta'), paint_color_mixture(paint_type='Acrylic', color='navy')]\n\n However, note: the function call for the second paint_type is written as 'Acrylic' (which is correct) but in the string we write it exactly as that.\n\n Let's write the output accordingly."}

Since the user asks for two cities (Berlin and Paris), we need to make two separate calls.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We must compute the date for next Friday. But note: the function does not handle relative dates. We must compute the actual date string (YYYY-MM-DD) for next Friday.\n    However, the function call must be in the parameters. We don't have a function to compute dates, so we must do it ourselves? But the problem says: we can only use the provided functions.\n\n Since we are not provided with a function to compute dates, we have to assume that the assistant can compute the date for next Friday in its own context? \n But note the instruction: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and we are to use the provided functions.\n\n How to handle this?\n  - We are not allowed to do anything else. We must rely on the provided function. However, the function requires a date string.\n\n Since the user said \"next Friday\", we cannot pass that as a string. We must compute it. But we don't have a function for that.\n\n However, note that the system might be able to compute the date for next Friday in the background? But the function call requires a string in a specific format.\n\n Let's reexamine: the instruction says \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\".\n\n We are missing the exact date string. But we cannot compute it without a function. So we must indicate that we are missing the parameter?\n\n But wait: the user said \"next Friday\". We can interpret that as a relative date. However, without a function to compute it, we cannot.\n\n Alternative approach: \n  - We are allowed to generate multiple function calls until the task is complete. But we don't have a function to get the current date or compute next Friday.\n\n Therefore, we must assume that the system will provide the current date? Or we have to note the problem.\n\n However, note that the function call must be made with the exact date. Since we don't have a way to compute it, we have to leave it as a variable? \n\n But the instruction says: we must produce function calls. We cannot leave it as a variable.\n\n So we have two options:\n   Option 1: We try to compute the date for next Friday in our own code (if we are allowed to do so in the assistant's context) and then use that string in the function call.\n   Option 2: We indicate that we are missing the exact date.\n\n However, the problem states: \"Do your best to fully address the user's request.\"\n\n Since we are in a simulated environment, we can assume that the system will interpret \"next Friday\" as a relative term and convert it to an absolute date? But that's not what the function expects.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a helper function? But we are not given one.\n\n Given the constraints, we must note that the function requires a date string. We don't have that. Therefore, we cannot complete the request without knowing the current date.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"If required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\".\n\n How do we indicate? We are only allowed to output function calls. We cannot output text.\n\n This is a dilemma.\n\n Let me re-read the instruction: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format is [func_name(params)].\n\n We cannot output anything else. Therefore, we must try to compute the date in our own context (if we are allowed to do so) and then use it.\n\n Since this is a simulation, and we are the assistant, we can compute the date for next Friday? But note: we don't know the current date.\n\n Without knowing the current date, we cannot compute next Friday.\n\n Therefore, we must break down:\n\n  We are missing the exact date string for next Friday. We cannot get it from the user without a function to ask? But we don't have that function.\n\n  So we have to make an assumption: we cannot complete the function call without the date.\n\n  But note: the user might have provided the date implicitly as \"next Friday\". We can interpret that as a relative date and convert it to an absolute date if we know today.\n\n  However, the system might have a way to get the current date? But we are not provided with a function for that.\n\n  We are stuck.\n\n  How about we output the function call with the date parameter set to \"next Friday\"? But the function expects a string in a specific format? The description doesn't specify the format, but typically it would be YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n  But \"next Friday\" is not in that format.\n\n  Therefore, we must not make the call because it would be invalid.\n\n  We have to indicate that we are missing a required parameter? But we cannot output text.\n\n  This is a problem.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try to use a placeholder? But that would not be valid.\n\n  Given the constraints, I think we have to assume that the system will handle relative dates? Or we have to note that the function requires an absolute date.\n\n  But the function description says: \"The date on which the user wants to attend a concert.\" - it doesn't specify the format. So maybe we can pass \"next Friday\"? But that might not be supported.\n\n  Since we don't have a way to convert it, and we don't have a function to do so, we must make the call with the string \"next Friday\" and hope the backend can interpret it? \n\n  However, that is risky. The function might require a specific format.\n\n  Another idea: the problem says \"Do your best\". So we try to use the function with the relative string? \n\n  But note: the function might be designed to accept relative dates? We don't know.\n\n  Given the ambiguity, and since we are required to produce function calls, we will make two calls (for Berlin and Paris) with the date set to \"next Friday\" and hope that the backend can handle it.\n\n  Alternatively, we can look at the function definition again: the parameter 'date' is of type string. It doesn't specify the format. So we pass the string as the user said.\n\n  Let's do that.\n\n  Also, the user wants classical concerts. So genre: \"classical\".\n\n  And amenities: we want parking. The default is ['Parking'] so we can leave it as default. But to be explicit, we can set it.\n\n  Therefore, we will make two calls:\n\n    concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])\n    concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])\n\n  But note: the function has a default for amenities, but the user specifically said \"available parking\", so we set it to include parking.\n\n  However, the function's default is already ['Parking'], so we could omit it. But to be explicit, we set it.\n\n  Also, note that the function requires the parameters as per the required list: location, date, genre. We are providing all.\n\n  So we output:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"]), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])]\n\n  But wait: what if next Friday is ambiguous? For example, if today is Monday, next Friday is in 4 days. If today is Saturday, next Friday might be in 6 days? But we don't know.\n\n  We are taking a risk.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use a function that we don't have? But we don't.\n\n  Therefore, we do the above.\n\n  However, note that the function might not support relative dates. We are doing our best.\n\n  Also, note: the user asked for \"next Friday\", which is a common term. The backend might be able to resolve it.\n\n  Let's proceed.\n\n  But note: the function is called twice, once for each city.\n\n  So the final output is:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"]), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])]\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format is [func_name(params)].\n\n  We are returning two function calls.\n\n  Format: \n    [func1(param1=value1, ...), func2(param1=value1, ...)]\n\n  We must be careful with the string values: use double quotes in the parameters? But the example in the instruction uses double quotes for the entire call? Actually, the example in the instruction is: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]\n\n  We are using double quotes for the string values. However, in the output we are going to write, we must use the same.\n\n  But note: the entire output is a string. We have to represent the function calls as a string.\n\n  We'll use double quotes for the string parameters.\n\n  However, in the array for amenities, we have a list of strings. We represent it as [\"Parking\"].\n\n  But note: the array is inside the function call. We must use double quotes for the string inside the array? \n\n  We can use: amenities=[\"Parking\"] -> but the double quotes around \"Parking\" are necessary.\n\n  How to represent in the string? We are going to write:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"]), ...]\n\n  But the entire output must be a string. We are writing in a string context.\n\n  We can use single quotes for the outer string? But the instruction does not specify.\n\n  Alternatively, we can escape the inner quotes? But the example in the instruction doesn't escape.\n\n  Actually, the instruction says: \"Use the following format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)].\"\n\n  And in the example, they don't use any quotes for the values? Actually, they don't show a string value.\n\n  We have to infer. Since we are writing a string representation, we should use double quotes for the entire call? \n\n  But note: the function parameters are being passed as keyword arguments. In the representation, we are writing them as if in code.\n\n  We'll follow the example: they wrote \"params_name1=params_value1\" without quotes for the value even if it is a string? \n\n  But that would be ambiguous. How do we represent a string?\n\n  Looking at the example: the function call in the instruction has a string in the description: \"The city where the user wants to find a concert.\" -> but not in the example call.\n\n  We must use a standard that can be parsed. The instruction does not specify.\n\n  But note: the system that receives the function calls will parse it. We assume it can handle quoted strings.\n\n  We'll use double quotes for string parameters.\n\n  How about we try to mimic Python syntax? The function is described in Python 3 syntax.\n\n  In Python, we would write: concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", ...)\n\n  So we write the function calls in the same way.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"]), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=[\"Parking\"])]\n\n  But note: the array of amenities: in Python we write [\"Parking\"] -> but in a string representation, we have to write it as is.\n\n  However, when we write the entire output as a string, we have to be careful with quotes.\n\n  We are going to write the entire response as a string. We can use single quotes for the outer string? But the instruction doesn't specify.\n\n  Actually, the instruction says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" meaning we are to output the function calls in the specified format, which is a list of function calls in a string representation.\n\n  We'll output exactly as if we were writing a list of function calls in Python, with double quotes for string values and the array as in Python.\n\n  The system will parse it.\n\n  So let's write it.\n\n  However, note: the array element \"Parking\" is a string, so we must put it in quotes. We use double quotes for that too? But then we have double quotes inside double quotes.\n\n  We can escape? Or use single quotes inside? \n\n  In Python, we can use single quotes for the string inside. So we can write: amenities=['Parking'] -> that is valid.\n\n  But the function parameter description says the array items are of type string. It doesn't specify the quote style.\n\n  We'll use single quotes for the strings inside the array to avoid escaping in the outer double quotes? But the instruction example doesn't show.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use double quotes for the entire string and escape the inner double quotes? That would be messy.\n\n  Since the function is in Python 3 syntax, we can write the array with single quoted strings: ['Parking'].\n\n  So we do:\n\n    concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking'])\n\n  But note: the enum in the function definition uses double quotes? But that doesn't matter.\n\n  So we change to single quotes for the string in the array.\n\n  Why? Because we are writing the function call in a string and we don't want to escape. Also, in Python, both are allowed.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use double quotes for the array string and escape? But that is less readable.\n\n  We decide: use double quotes for the top-level string parameters (location, date, genre) and single quotes for the array elements.\n\n  So:\n\n    concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking'])\n\n  Then the entire list:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking']), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking'])]\n\n  But note: the entire output is a string. We are writing it without any extra quotes? Actually, the entire output is the string representation of the list.\n\n  We'll output exactly that.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the function might expect the amenities to be in double quotes? But in the function definition, the enum values are given as strings without specifying the quote style.\n\n  We'll assume the backend is flexible.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking']), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking'])]\n\n  But wait: we have a typo: 'Parking' in the first call is written as 'Parking'? Actually, I see: in the first call I wrote \"Parking\" correctly? In the first call I wrote ['Parking'] and then in the second call I wrote ['Parking']? Actually, in the code above I have a typo: 'Parking' vs 'Parking'. Let me correct.\n\n  Actually, in the first call I wrote: ['Parking'] -> that's correct? But in the second call I wrote ['Parking'] -> that's also correct.\n\n  Correction: in the first call I wrote: amenities=['Parking'] -> but then I wrote 'Parking'? Actually, I see: I wrote \"Parking\" as \"Parking\" in the first call? Actually, I wrote: amenities=['Parking'] -> that's with a 'g'. But then in the second call I wrote amenities=['Parking'] -> also with a 'g'. So that's correct.\n\n  Actually, I see in the first call I wrote: ['Parking'] -> that is a typo? It should be ['Parking'] -> with an 'g'. But I wrote 'Parking'? That's missing the 'g'. Oh no! I see: I wrote 'Parking' without the 'g'. It should be 'Parking'. \n\n  Correction: the word is \"Parking\", not \"Parking\". So we must write 'Parking'.\n\n  Actually, in the function definition, the enum has: \"Parking\" (with a 'g').\n\n  So we must write: amenities=['Parking']   (with a 'g').\n\n  Therefore, we correct:\n\n    [concert.find_nearby(location=\"Berlin\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking']), concert.find_nearby(location=\"Paris\", date=\"next Friday\", genre=\"classical\", amenities=['Parking'])]\n\n  But note: the enum also has other amenities, but we are only including 'Parking'.\n\n  This should be acceptable.\n\n  Let's output that."}

However, reading carefully: \n            \"calculate the highest common factor of the pair of numbers (45, 60) and then use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\"\n            This could mean: \n              Option A: HCF( HCF(45,60), HCF(90,120) ) \n              Option B: HCF( HCF(45,60), 90 ) and then with 120? or HCF( HCF(45,60), (90,120) )? \n\n But note: the function math.hcf takes two integers. The user says \"with another pair of numbers (90,120)\" meaning that they want to use the result from (45,60) and then do something with the pair (90,120). \n\n However, the next part: \"Please also find the highest common factor of the pair (36, 48) and then find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72, 96).\"\n\n This second part is clearer: \n   Step 4: HCF(36,48) -> result3\n   Step 5: HCF(72,96) -> result4\n   Step 6: HCF(result3, result4)\n\n But wait, the second part says: \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72,96)\". \n   This could be interpreted as HCF( result3, (72,96) ) which is not possible. \n   Alternatively, it might mean: first compute result4 = HCF(72,96) and then HCF(result3, result4). \n   Or, it might mean HCF( result3, 72 ) and then with 96? \n\n Let's re-read: \"find the highest common factor of that result with the pair (72,96)\".\n The word \"pair\" suggests that we are to compute the HCF of the two numbers in the pair and then use the result from step4 (which is a single number) and that new result? \n\n Actually, the intended meaning is likely:\n   Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60)\n   Step 2: h2 = hcf(90,120)\n   Step 3: h3 = hcf(h1, h2)\n\n   Step 4: h4 = hcf(36,48)\n   Step 5: h5 = hcf(72,96)\n   Step 6: h6 = hcf(h4, h5)\n\n But note the user says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90,120)\".\n That might be interpreted as: take the result from step1 (h1) and then compute the HCF of h1 and the pair (90,120). But that doesn't make sense because the function takes two integers.\n\n Alternatively, the user might mean: \n   Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60)\n   Step 2: h2 = hcf(h1, 90)   and then h3 = hcf(h2, 120) ... but that is not what the words say.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will follow the most logical interpretation: \n   The user wants two separate chains:\n   Chain 1: \n        step1: h1 = hcf(45,60)\n        step2: h2 = hcf(90,120)\n        step3: h3 = hcf(h1, h2)\n\n   Chain 2:\n        step4: h4 = hcf(36,48)\n        step5: h5 = hcf(72,96)\n        step6: h6 = hcf(h4, h5)\n\n However, note the function only takes two numbers at a time. So we break down:\n\n For Chain 1:\n   First call: math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60) -> let the result be h1 (we don't know the value until we call, but we are only generating calls)\n   Second call: math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120) -> h2\n   Third call: math.hcf(number1=h1, number2=h2) -> but we don't have h1 and h2 until we run the first two.\n\n We are only to generate the function calls. We cannot run them, but we can chain the calls by using the results of previous calls as parameters in subsequent calls.\n\n However, the format we are to use is a list of function calls. We cannot use variables. We must pass concrete values? \n But note: the system will run the calls in order and pass the results to the next call? Actually, the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format is a list of function calls.\n\n How can we represent the dependency? \n\n The problem says: \"Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\" and the system will run the calls and then we can use the results in the next turn? \n\n But note: the instruction says \"in each turn, do your best to fully address the user's request\". And we are to return only the function calls.\n\n However, we are allowed to output multiple function calls in one turn? The example format: [func1(...), func2(...)]\n\n But the system will run them in order and then we can use the results? Actually, the problem says: \"Once no more calls are needed, the system will proceed to the next turn.\" meaning that we can have multiple turns? \n\n But the user's request is in one turn. We are to generate the calls for this turn.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that we can use the result of one call as input to the next in the same list. Therefore, we must break it down:\n\n We cannot do:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=result_of_first, number2=result_of_second)]\n\n because we don't have the results until the system runs the first two.\n\n Therefore, we must break it into multiple turns? \n\n But the instruction says: \"in each turn\" ... meaning that we are to generate the calls for the current turn until we have done as much as we can without the results.\n\n However, note the example format: we are to return a list of function calls. And the system will run them and then we can have another turn? \n\n But the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and \"Once no more calls are needed, the system will proceed to the next turn.\"\n\n So in the first turn, we can only generate the independent calls. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to generate the dependent ones.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"do your best to fully address the user's request\" and \"continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete\".\n\n But we are only allowed to output function calls in the current turn. So we must break the problem:\n\n Turn 1:\n   We can compute the first two hcfs for chain1 and the first two for chain2 independently.\n\n   So we do:\n     call1: math.hcf(45,60)\n     call2: math.hcf(90,120)\n     call3: math.hcf(36,48)\n     call4: math.hcf(72,96)\n\n Turn 2:\n   We get the results: \n        r1 = result of call1\n        r2 = result of call2\n        r3 = result of call3\n        r4 = result of call4\n\n   Then we can do:\n        call5: math.hcf(r1, r2)\n        call6: math.hcf(r3, r4)\n\n But note: the problem says \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and we are to do it in one turn? \n\n Actually, the problem says \"in each turn\", meaning that we are having a multi-turn interaction. But the user only provided one query. \n\n However, the instruction says: \"Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\" meaning that we might need multiple responses (turns) from the assistant.\n\n But the assistant only outputs one response per turn. So we break:\n\n Turn 1 (this turn): we output the four independent calls.\n\n Then the system runs them and in the next turn we output the two dependent calls.\n\n But the problem says: \"You are given a user query and a set of available functions.\" and we are to produce one or more function calls to fulfill the request.\n\n And we are to do our best in the current turn. \n\n However, we cannot complete the entire request without the intermediate results. So we must break it.\n\n How about: we output the four independent calls in the first turn? \n\n The format: [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n Then in the next turn, we will have the results and we can output:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=result1, number2=result2), math.hcf(number1=result3, number2=result4)]\n\n But we don't know the results until we run. \n\n However, the problem does not specify how the results are passed. We are only generating the function calls. \n\n Therefore, we must generate the calls that are possible now. The system will run them and then we can generate the next calls in the next turn.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"Once no more calls are needed, the system will proceed to the next turn.\" meaning that we are to generate as many as we can in one turn? \n\n Actually, we are to generate all the calls that we can without the results. \n\n So for turn 1, we generate the four independent calls.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"If no suitable function exists, or required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\"\n\n We have a function that takes two integers. For the first four, we have the integers. For the next two, we don't have the integers until we get the results.\n\n Therefore, we cannot generate the next two in the same turn.\n\n So we do:\n\n Turn 1: [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n Then the system runs these and in the next turn, we are provided with the results? \n\n But the problem doesn't specify how the results are provided to the assistant in the next turn. \n\n However, the instruction says: \"Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\" meaning that we will have multiple turns.\n\n So in the first turn, we output the four calls.\n\n In the next turn, the system will give us the results of these four calls and then we can output the two final calls.\n\n But note: the user's request is given in one turn. We are expected to break it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to do it in one turn by having nested calls? \n\n But the function only takes two integers. We cannot call a function and use its result as an argument in the same call list? Because the call list is executed sequentially? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify the execution model. But the format does not allow nesting. It is a flat list.\n\n Therefore, we break it into two sets of calls.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and we are only allowed to output the calls for the current turn.\n\n So we must do:\n\n Turn 1: \n   [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n Then, after the system runs these, we get the results. Then in Turn 2, we can do:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=result1, number2=result2), math.hcf(number1=result3, number2=result4)]\n\n But we don't know the variable names for the results? \n\n The problem does not specify how the results are stored. We are only generating the calls. \n\n However, in the next turn, the system will provide the context of the previous results? \n\n But the instruction does not specify. Therefore, we must assume that the system will manage the state and we can refer to the results by some handle? \n\n Alternatively, the problem expects that we break the work into independent steps and the system will run them and then we can use the results in the next turn by their natural values? \n\n But note: the function parameters require integers. So in the next turn, we must have the integers. \n\n How will we get the integers? The system must provide them.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the system will run the four calls and then in the next turn, we are given the four results as part of the context? \n\n But the problem does not say that. \n\n Alternatively, we can note that the problem says: \"If required parameters are missing, clearly indicate this.\" \n\n For the final two calls, the parameters (the integers) are missing because they depend on the previous computations. So we cannot generate them in the first turn.\n\n Therefore, we must generate the first four calls and then stop. Then in the next turn, when we have the results, we generate the last two.\n\n But the problem says: \"do your best to fully address the user's request\" in each turn. \n\n In the first turn, we are doing the best we can: we are starting the computation.\n\n So I will output:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n Then, in the next turn, the system will have the results and we can generate the next two.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that we are in a multi-turn conversation. But the instruction mentions \"turns\".\n\n But note: the user only provided one query. So we are in the first turn.\n\n Therefore, we output the four independent calls.\n\n But wait, what if the system expects all calls in one go? \n\n The instruction says: \"Continue generating function calls until all tasks are complete.\" meaning that we might output multiple calls in one turn? \n\n But we cannot output the last two without the intermediate results.\n\n So we break it as described.\n\n However, let me check: the problem says \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format is a list. \n\n We are returning a list of four calls.\n\n We are not including any other text.\n\n So we do:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n And then in the next turn, we will be given the results and we can output:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=result1, number2=result2), math.hcf(number1=result3, number2=result4)]\n\n But we don't know the actual values of result1, result2, result3, result4 until the system runs them. \n\n How can we refer to them? \n\n The problem doesn't specify. Therefore, we must assume that the system will run the four calls and then in the next turn, we are provided with the results and we can use them as numbers? \n\n Alternatively, the system might assign variable names? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the function parameters require integers, we must have the integers. \n\n Therefore, in the next turn, we will have the integers and we can output the calls with the actual numbers? \n\n But we don't know the numbers until the system runs. \n\n Therefore, we must break the work.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the user might have intended:\n\n   HCF(45,60) = 15\n   HCF(90,120)=30\n   Then HCF(15,30)=15\n\n   HCF(36,48)=12\n   HCF(72,96)=24\n   Then HCF(12,24)=12\n\n But we are not to compute, we are to generate function calls.\n\n So we stick to the plan:\n\n Turn 1: the four independent calls.\n\n Turn 2: the two dependent calls, but we don't have the numbers? \n\n How do we get the numbers? We must wait for the system to run the first four and then we can use the results.\n\n Therefore, we must rely on the system to provide the results in the next turn as part of the state.\n\n But the problem does not specify the state passing. \n\n Given the constraints, we output the four independent calls in the first turn.\n\n Then, in the next turn, the system will provide the results, and we can output:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=15, number2=30), math.hcf(number1=12, number2=24)]\n\n but wait, we don't know the results until the system runs. \n\n So we cannot hardcode 15,30,12,24 because we don't know them. \n\n Therefore, we must have a way to refer to the results of the previous calls.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, I will assume that the system will manage and we can refer to the results by the values we get. \n\n Alternatively, the system might assign variable names? \n\n But the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format is with concrete values? \n\n So in the next turn, we must have the concrete values. \n\n How? The system will run the first four and then present the results to the assistant in the next turn? \n\n For example, the next turn the assistant might see:\n\n   \"Previous results: \n        math.hcf(45,60) -> 15\n        math.hcf(90,120) -> 30\n        math.hcf(36,48) -> 12\n        math.hcf(72,96) -> 24\"\n\n Then we can generate:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=15, number2=30), math.hcf(number1=12, number2=24)]\n\n But note: the problem says we are only to generate the function calls. We are not to include any other text.\n\n Therefore, we must generate the calls with the concrete numbers that we get from the previous results.\n\n However, we are in the first turn and we don't have the numbers. \n\n So we cannot generate the last two in the first turn.\n\n We must break the response into two turns.\n\n Turn 1: [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n Turn 2: [math.hcf(number1= [result of first call] , number2= [result of second call] ), math.hcf(number1= [result of third call] , number2= [result of fourth call] )]\n\n But we don't have the results in turn 2 unless the system provides them.\n\n The problem does not specify how the system provides the results. \n\n Therefore, I will assume that the system will run the calls and then in the next turn, the assistant is given the results as part of the context. \n\n But we are not told the format of the context. \n\n Since we are only to return function calls, and the function parameters are integers, we must have the integers. \n\n So in turn 2, we will have to know the integers. \n\n How? The system must tell us. \n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the instruction says to do our best in the current turn, I will generate the four independent calls in the first turn.\n\n Then, in the next turn, if we are provided with the results, we generate the final two.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You are given a user query\" and we are to produce one or more function calls to fulfill the request.\n\n We are fulfilling the request in two steps.\n\n So for the first turn, we output:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\n And then we stop.\n\n The system will run these and then in the next turn, we will be given the results and we can generate the next two.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Once no more calls are needed, the system will proceed to the next turn.\" meaning that after we output the four calls, the system will run them and then we are done? \n\n But we are not done because we still need to do the two final calls.\n\n However, we cannot do them without the results. \n\n Therefore, we must hope that the system will provide the results in the next turn.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might expect that we break the user's request into two parts and handle them in two assistant responses.\n\n So we do:\n\n   Turn 1 (assistant): [math.hcf(45,60), math.hcf(90,120), math.hcf(36,48), math.hcf(72,96)]\n\n   Turn 2 (system): runs the calls and returns the results: [15, 30, 12, 24]\n\n   Turn 3 (assistant): [math.hcf(15,30), math.hcf(12,24)]\n\n But the problem doesn't specify the system's response. \n\n Given the constraints, we output the four calls in the first turn.\n\n We cannot do more.\n\n Therefore, the answer for this turn is:\n\n   [math.hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math.hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math.hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math.hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]"}

A detailed description of a neuron cell.\n 2. A less detailed description of a muscle cell.\n\n The available function is 'biology.get_cell_info' which takes:\n   - cell_type (required): string, the type of cell.\n   - detailed (optional, default false): boolean, if true, returns a detailed description.\n\n For the neuron cell, we want detailed information -> set detailed=true.\n For the muscle cell, we want less detailed -> use default (detailed=false) or explicitly set detailed=false.\n\n However, note that the user asks to compare them. But the function only retrieves one cell at a time.\n\n We must make two separate calls:\n   First call: neuron cell with detailed=true.\n   Second call: muscle cell with detailed=false.\n\n The function does not have a comparison function, so we can only get the individual descriptions. \n The user's request to \"compare\" might be done by the system after retrieving both. Our task is to generate the function calls.\n\n Since the function does not support comparison in one call, we break it into two.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Call for neuron (detailed=true)\n  2. Call for muscle (detailed=false)\n\n The function call format should be:\n   [biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='neuron', detailed=true), biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='muscle cell', detailed=false)]\n\n But note: the function parameter for muscle cell might be specified as 'muscle cell'. However, we must use the exact term that the function expects? \n The description does not specify exact terms. We have to use reasonable terms.\n\n However, the function description says: \"Type of cell you want information about\". We can use:\n   For neuron: \"neuron\" or \"neuron cell\"? The user said \"neuron cell\", but the function might accept \"neuron\". Similarly, for muscle: \"muscle cell\".\n\n But note: the user said \"muscle cell in the human body\". We can use \"muscle cell\".\n\n Since the function does not specify a controlled vocabulary, we use the common terms.\n\n Therefore, we generate:\n\n   biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='neuron', detailed=True) \n   biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='muscle cell', detailed=False)\n\n However, note: in the function definition, the default for detailed is false, so for muscle we could omit it. But to be explicit, we can set it.\n\n But the problem says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and use the format.\n\n Important: The function name is exactly 'biology.get_cell_info'. The parameters are named and we must use the same.\n\n Also note: the parameters are in a dictionary. We represent them as key=value in the call.\n\n Let's write:\n\n   [biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='neuron', detailed=True), biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='muscle cell', detailed=False)]\n\n However, note that the function definition uses 'detailed' as a boolean. In Python, we use True and False (capitalized). But in the function call representation, we are not in Python? The instruction says: \"Use the following format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\"\n\n The example in the instruction uses: \"func_name2(params)\" but without specifying the type. We must represent the values appropriately.\n\n Since the function expects a boolean for 'detailed', we use the JSON-like representation? Actually, the instruction does not specify, but we are to represent the call.\n\n But note: the function is defined in Python 3 syntax. So we use Python literals: True and False.\n\n Also, the cell_type is a string, so we put it in quotes.\n\n However, in the format example, they did not use quotes for non-string? But for string they must. The example in the instruction does not show a string.\n\n But we have to represent the call correctly. We'll use:\n\n   For string: enclose in quotes (single or double, but in the example above we used single). Let's use single for consistency.\n\n   For boolean: use True and False (without quotes).\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n   [biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='neuron', detailed=True), biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='muscle cell', detailed=False)]\n\n But note: the function call for muscle cell: the cell_type is \"muscle cell\", which is two words. We use a space.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the function might expect a specific term. But without a list, we use the common term.\n\n Alternatively, the function might accept \"muscle\" or \"muscle cell\". The user said \"muscle cell\", so we use that.\n\n We are generating two function calls in one response? The instruction says: \"produce one or more function/tool calls\". We can return multiple in the list.\n\n So the entire output should be:\n\n   [biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='neuron', detailed=True), biology.get_cell_info(cell_type='muscle cell', detailed=False)]\n\n But note: the function name is exactly as provided: 'biology.get_cell_info'.
