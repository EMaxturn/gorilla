Let me check the available functions. There's the get_current_weather function. It requires the location parameter, which should be a string like 'City, State'. The function also takes optional parameters for url and unit, but the defaults are set. Since the user didn't specify the unit, I'll use the default, which is celsius. Wait, but in the US, people usually use Fahrenheit. Hmm, but the default is celsius. Maybe I should check if the user wants a specific unit, but they didn't mention it. So I'll proceed with the default.\n\nFirst, I need to call get_current_weather for Boston, MA. Then, another call for San Francisco, CA. The function can be called twice with each location.

The user wants to log their food intake. They mentioned two instances: first, 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea, and earlier, two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\n\nLooking at the available function, it's log_food. The parameters required are food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type (optional, default snack), and log_date (optional, default None). \n\nFor the first entry: 8 pieces of mango. The portion_unit should be 'piece' as per the enum. The food name is 'frozen mango'. Portion amount is 8.0. Meal type isn't specified, so default to 'snack'. Log date isn't given, so use default.\n\nThen, the chai tea. Need to log that too. But the function parameters don't mention beverage. Wait, the food_name can be 'chai tea'. Portion amount and unit? The user didn't specify, but maybe assume a standard portion. But the function requires these parameters. Since the user didn't provide, maybe I can't log it without assuming. But the user might expect both items to be logged. Hmm, but the function requires portion_amount and unit. Since the user didn't specify for chai tea, maybe I should only log the mango pieces. Wait, but the user might have intended to log both. Alternatively, maybe the chai tea is considered a beverage with a standard portion, but the function doesn't have a default for that. So perhaps I can't log the chai tea without more info. But the user might expect both entries. Wait, the original message says \"I had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea.\" So both are part of the same meal? Or separate? The function allows multiple calls. So for the first part, log the mango, then log the chai tea. But for the chai tea, the portion amount and unit are missing. The user didn't specify, so maybe I can't log it. But maybe the user expects that the chai tea is logged with a default, but the function doesn't have defaults for those parameters. So perhaps only the mango is logged. Similarly for the pizza and coffee. The user said \"two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee.\" Again, the coffee's portion isn't specified. So maybe only the pizza is logged. But the user might have intended to log all items. However, the function requires the parameters. So I need to check if the parameters are provided. For the first entry: food_name is 'frozen mango', portion_amount 8.0, portion_unit 'piece'. Meal_type is not given, so default to 'snack'. Log_date is not given, so default to None. Then, the chai tea: food_name 'chai tea', but portion_amount and unit are missing. So can't log that. Similarly, for the pizza: two slices, so food_name 'pepperoni pizza', portion_amount 2.0, unit 'slice', meal_type default 'snack'. Coffee: same issue as chai tea. So the answer would be two function calls: one for the mango and one for the pizza. The user might have intended to log all, but without the parameters for the beverages, they can't be logged. So the correct function calls are log_food for frozen mango and pepperoni pizza."}
