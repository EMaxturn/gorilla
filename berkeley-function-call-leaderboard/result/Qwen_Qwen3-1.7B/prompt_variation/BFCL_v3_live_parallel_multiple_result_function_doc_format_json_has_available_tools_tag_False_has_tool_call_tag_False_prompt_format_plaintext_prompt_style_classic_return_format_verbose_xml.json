The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences should include size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The user wants large, hot, regular sweetness, and almond milk. So size is 'large', temperature 'hot', sweetness_level 'regular', milk_type 'almond'. The default for size is medium, but the user specified large, so we need to set that.

The state in the location is Ireland, which is already a country, so the format is \"City, Country\". The function's parameters allow that.

The user wants to perform several actions using the provided functions. Let me break down each step and see which functions are needed.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and optionally destination. Since the default destination is '.', I can just pass the repo_url. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to the given URL.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. The repo directory is probably the one where the clone was done, so I'll use the directory name from the clone. But wait, the clone function's destination is default '.', so maybe the directory is already there. But the function requires the directory_name, so I need to specify that. Let's assume the directory is the cloned repo's path. So call create_a_docker_file with directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs based on the analysis. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function needs the directory_name. Again, if the cloned repo is in the current directory, maybe the directory_name is the same as the cloned repo's path. So call that function with the same directory_name.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git changes. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires the directory_name and commit_message. The commit message defaults to 'Update changes', but maybe the user wants a specific one. However, the user didn't specify a commit message, so use the default. The branch name is 'main' by default, so that's okay. Force push is default False, so no need to specify unless needed. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nWait, but the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is handled by the push function. But the push function's description says it pushes all changes, so that's covered.\n\nNow, check if all parameters are present. For clone_repo, repo_url is provided. For create_a_docker_file, directory_name is needed. The user's step 2.1 says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\", so the directory_name should be the repo directory. Similarly for Kubernetes.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified the directory name for the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. However, the functions require the directory_name parameter. So the assistant needs to call these functions with the correct directory name. Assuming that the cloned repo is in the current directory, the directory_name would be the same as the cloned repo's path. But since the clone function's destination is '.', the directory is '.'.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url=\"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\", destination=\".\")\n2. create_a_docker_file(directory_name=\".\")\n3. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name=\".\")\n4. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name=\".\", commit_message=\"Update changes\", branch_name=\"main\", force_push=False)\n\nWait, but the push function's parameters have directory_name as required. So all four steps need to be called. Each step is a separate function call. The user's steps are in order, so each function call is done sequentially.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to output all function calls in the response. So each function call is a separate <function> block.\n\nSo the final answer would include all four function calls."}

The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', so I need to find classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters required are 'search_string' and 'include_subdirectories'. The search string should be 'CellResult' and include subdirectories as true.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters needed are 'class_name' and 'method_name'. For 'setCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method is 'setCellValue'. Similarly, for 'getCellValue', the class is 'AbstractCellHandler' and the method is 'getCellValue'.
