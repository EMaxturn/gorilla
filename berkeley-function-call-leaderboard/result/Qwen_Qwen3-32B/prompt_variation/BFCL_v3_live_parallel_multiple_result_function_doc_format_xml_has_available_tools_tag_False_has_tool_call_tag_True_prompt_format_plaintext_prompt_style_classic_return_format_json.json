The location needs to be in 'City, State' format, but since Ireland and France don't use states, the format would be 'City, Country'. The user provided Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland, which fits. \n\nFor Paris, the parameters would be location: \"Paris, France\" and language: \"en\".

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided Git URL. The function clone_repo is the right choice here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. Since the destination isn't specified, it will clone to the current directory by default. So I'll call clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo's contents to determine the main language. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory name. Assuming the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name would be the repo's root, maybe \"nodejs-welcome\". But since the user didn't specify a subdirectory, I'll use the default, which might be the current directory. Wait, the function's parameter is required, so I need to provide a directory name. Let's assume the repo is cloned into a directory named \"nodejs-welcome\". So I'll call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nOnce the analysis is done, the next step is to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name. Again, using \"nodejs-welcome\" as the directory where the Dockerfile should be created.\n\nThen, generate Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory name. Since the user didn't specify other parameters like deployment name, image name, etc., I'll use the default values. So I'll call this function with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nAfter modifying the files, I need to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can handle adding, committing, and pushing. The directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\". The commit message and branch name aren't provided, so I'll use default values. The commit message could be something generic like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\", but since the user didn't specify, maybe leave it out. However, the function allows for a commit message. Wait, the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" and then commit/push. So the function push_git_changes_to_github will handle adding all changes. I'll call it with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\" and maybe a commit message if required. Since the commit_message is optional, but the user didn't specify, perhaps the function will use a default message. Alternatively, the user might expect a specific message, but since it's not given, I'll omit it unless required. The branch name is also optional; if not provided, it might default to the current branch. So the function call would be push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nWait, the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" and step 4 is commit/push. The push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So calling that function should handle adding, committing, and pushing. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push changes.\n\nI need to make sure all these functions are called in order. Each function's output depends on the previous. So the tool calls should be in sequence: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github."}

First, they're getting a compilation error because the method 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. So, I should use the 'get_relevant_classes' function with the search string 'CellResult' and set 'include_subdirectories' to true.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to check their overrides. For that, I'll use the 'get_signature' function twice, once for each method. The class name is 'AbstractCellHandler', and the method names are 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. I should make sure to specify the correct parameters. Since the user didn't mention private methods, I can omit the 'include_private' parameter or set it to false.\n\nWait, the 'get_relevant_classes' function's 'include_subdirectories' is a boolean required false, so I need to set that to true. Also, the 'search_string' is 'CellResult'. Then, for the method signatures, two separate calls to 'get_signature' with each method name. Let me structure the JSON calls properly.
