So I should call get_current_weather for Boston and get_current_weather for San Francisco. Also, maybe check if the unit is needed for both.

The user mentioned they had 8 pieces of frozen mango and a chai tea. Then they also had two slices of pepperoni pizza and a coffee. The task is to log these items.

The user provided the food items but didn't specify the portion amounts or units. For example, the mango is 8 pieces, but the function probably expects a unit. The pepperoni pizza is two slices, but again, the unit isn't mentioned. The coffee is a single item, but the function might need a unit. Since the user didn't specify the units or the meal type for each item, I can't fill in the parameters. So I need to inform them that the required parameters are missing. But wait, the user's message only lists the items they had, not the units. So the answer should state that the parameters are missing. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user might expect me to call the function with the given items, but since the function requires more info, I can't. So the correct response is to indicate that the parameters are missing."}
