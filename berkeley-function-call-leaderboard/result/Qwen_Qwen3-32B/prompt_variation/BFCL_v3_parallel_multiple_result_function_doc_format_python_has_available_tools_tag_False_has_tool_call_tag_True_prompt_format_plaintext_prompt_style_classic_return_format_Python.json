The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which is standard for CSVs. So I'll call data_loading with file_path=\"dataset.csv\".\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to perform the linear regression. The linear_regression_fit function needs x and y, and the return_residuals flag. The user specified x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so I'll pass those as the x and y parameters. Since they want the residuals, return_residuals should be True.\n\nWait, but how does the data structure from data_loading work? Assuming that data_loading returns a data structure (like a dictionary or DataFrame) where we can access columns by keys like 'sales' and 'future_sales'. The user's code example uses data['sales'], so I'll follow that. So the x parameter would be data['sales'] and y would be data['future_sales'].\n\nSo the steps are: first load the data, then extract the x and y variables from the loaded data, then fit the model with those variables and return_residuals=True.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The data_loading function doesn't have any parameters missing, but the linear_regression_fit requires x and y. The user provided the column names, so that's covered.\n\nI think that's all.

The parameters are $5000 principal, 5 years, 4% annual rate. The function provided is calc_Simple_Interest, which requires principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. All the needed parameters are there. So I can call that function with those values.\n\nSecond option: compound interest.

All parameters are present, so that function can be used.\n\nThird option: initial investment of $3000, annual rate 5%, 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function here is future_value. Let's check the parameters. The function requires initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The rate given is 5%, so I need to convert that to 0.05. Time is 6 years, num_compoundings is 2 (since it's twice a year). So the parameters are all there.
