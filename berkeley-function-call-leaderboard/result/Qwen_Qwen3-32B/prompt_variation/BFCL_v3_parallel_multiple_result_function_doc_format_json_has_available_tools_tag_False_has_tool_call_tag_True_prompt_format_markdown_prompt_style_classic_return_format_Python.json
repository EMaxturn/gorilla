The user wants to use data from dataset.csv to fit a linear regression model where x is data['sales'] and y is data['future_sales'], and also calculate the residuals.\n\nFirst, I need to load the data from the CSV file. The available function for that is data_loading. The parameters required are file_path and an optional delimiter. The user mentioned dataset.csv, so the file_path is 'dataset.csv'. The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which is standard for CSVs. So I'll call data_loading with file_path='dataset.csv'.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to fit the linear regression model. The function linear_regression_fit requires x and y arrays. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales']. Assuming the data_loading function returns a data structure (like a dictionary or DataFrame), we can access those columns. Also, the user wants the residuals, so I need to set return_residuals=True.\n\nBut wait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit are x and y as arrays. So I need to make sure that after loading the data, the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns are extracted as arrays. However, the exact structure of the data loaded isn't specified here. But since the user's instruction is clear, I'll proceed with the function calls as per their specifications.\n\nSo the steps are: first load the data, then extract the x and y arrays from the loaded data, then call the linear regression function with those arrays and return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the function calls, how do I reference the data? The data_loading function would return the data, perhaps as a dictionary or similar structure. So in the parameters for linear_regression_fit, x would be data['sales'] and y data['future_sales'], but in the actual code, that would depend on how the data is structured. However, the user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so I'll follow that.\n\nTherefore, the correct function calls are first data_loading, then linear_regression_fit with the appropriate parameters. The residuals are obtained by setting return_residuals=True."}

So I'll call calc_energy with mols=5 and substance=\"C6H12O6\".\n\nSecond, using that energy, calculate the biomass with 10% efficiency. The function biological.calc_biomass requires energy and efficiency. Since efficiency defaults to 0.1 (10%), I just need to pass the energy from the first step. But I need to make sure to use the energy value obtained from the first calculation. However, since the functions are separate, I'll have to call calc_biomass with the energy parameter as the result of the first function. But since the user hasn't provided the actual energy value yet, I'll have to assume the first function's output is used here. So the second call would be calc_biomass with energy= (result from first step) and efficiency=0.1.\n\nThird, calculate the work done with the total energy and distance of 2 meters.

The parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1.

Compare that with the top scorer of Manchester United in the same competition (Premier League).\n3. Who was the top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season?\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The available functions are:\n\n- team_stats.get_top_scorer: Gets the top scorer for a team, with an optional competition parameter (default Premier League).\n- league_stats.get_top_scorer: Gets the top scorer for a league, with an optional season parameter (default 2019-2020).\n- player_stats.get_all_time_goals: Gets all-time goals for a player in a team, with an optional competition parameter (default Premier League).\n\nStarting with the first part: Cristiano Ronaldo's all-time goals for Manchester United in the Premier League. The function player_stats.get_all_time_goals requires player_name and team_name, and optionally competition. Since the user specified the Premier League, I should include that. So the parameters would be player_name=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\".\n\nNext, comparing that with Manchester United's top scorer in the same competition. The team_stats.get_top_scorer function takes team_name and competition. The default competition is already Premier League, so if we call team_stats.get_top_scorer(team_name=\"Manchester United\"), it should use the default. But to be explicit, maybe include competition=\"Premier League\" to ensure it's the same as the first part.\n\nThird part: The top scorer of the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season. The league_stats.get_top_scorer function requires league_name and optionally season. The default season is 2019-2020, so if we call league_stats.get_top_scorer(league_name=\"Premier League\"), it should use the default. But again, to be explicit, maybe include season=\"2019-2020\".\n\nNow, check if all required parameters are present. For the first function, player_name and team_name are required, which are provided. For the team's top scorer, team_name is required, which is given. For the league's top scorer, league_name is required, which is \"Premier League\".\n\nSo the three function calls needed are:\n\n1. player_stats.get_all_time_goals(player_name=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\", team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\")\n2. team_stats.get_top_scorer(team_name=\"Manchester United\", competition=\"Premier League\")\n3. league_stats.get_top_scorer(league_name=\"Premier League\", season=\"2019-2020\")\n\nI need to make sure that all these functions are called correctly with the right parameters. The user wants a comparison between Ronaldo's goals and the team's top scorer, so after getting both numbers, that comparison can be made. Then, the third part gives the league's top scorer for that specific season."}
