The region has a default, but the user specified it, so I should include that. I'll call store_price with these parameters to get the price. Since the question is about the cheapest price, maybe there's a sale, but the function store_price should return the current selling price, which might already account for any sales.

The user wants to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the object starts from rest, so initial speed is 0. The distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. They mention constant acceleration, so maybe I need to use the kinematic equations.\n\nLooking at the available functions: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. Wait, the calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest with constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). But wait, the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). But the user provided distance and time, and initial speed is 0. But the function's name is calculate_speed_from_rest, which might be the right one here.\n\nWait, but the function calculate_speed_from_rest's parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. But if the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. So maybe that function uses the formula for speed when starting from rest. But wait, the standard formula for distance under constant acceleration is s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Since u is 0, s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Then acceleration a = 2s/t\u00b2. Then final speed v = u + at = 0 + (2s/t\u00b2)*t = 2s/t. So maybe the function calculate_speed_from_rest is using that formula, where v = 2s/t. But the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance, time, and initial_speed. But the user's case has initial_speed as 0. So maybe the function is designed to calculate the final speed given distance, time, and initial speed. Wait, but the function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest, so maybe it's using the formula v = sqrt(2ad) or something else. Wait, maybe I need to check the parameters again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to calculate acceleration first using calculate_acceleration, then use that to find the final speed. Let's think. The calculate_acceleration function requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But if we don't know final_speed, that might not be helpful. Wait, but the user is asking for the final speed. So maybe the calculate_speed_from_rest function is the right one here. Let me check the parameters again. The calculate_speed_from_rest function has parameters distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user's case has distance 20 meters, time 4 seconds, initial speed 0. So passing those parameters to calculate_speed_from_rest would give the final speed. But wait, the function's name suggests it's calculating speed from rest, which would be the final speed. So maybe that's the correct function to use here. Let me see. If the function uses the formula v = 2d/t, then 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. But I need to confirm if that's what the function does. Since the function's description says it calculates the speed starting from rest under constant acceleration over a specified distance. So the formula would be v = sqrt(2ad), but since acceleration is constant, and using s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2, then a = 2s/t\u00b2. Then v = a*t = 2s/t. So yes, that would be 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. So the function calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, initial_speed 0 (default) would return 10 m/s. Therefore, the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. But since initial_speed is default 0, maybe it's optional. So the parameters would be distance=20, time=4. So the function call would be kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4. That should give the correct answer."}
