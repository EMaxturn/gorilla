However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current selling price.\n Since the store typically has one current selling price (which might be the base price or a sale price), we can assume that this function returns that price.\n\n However, if the game is available in different editions (like standard, deluxe) or if there are multiple listings (like from different sellers in a marketplace), \n the function might return the lowest available price? But the function description does not specify.\n\n Since the function `video_games.store_price` does not take an edition parameter, it likely returns the price for the standard edition or the lowest available price.\n\n Alternatively, note that there is also a function `video_games.on_sale` that checks if the game is on sale.

So we don't need to call the currency function.\n\n However, if the price is returned in a currency and we need to compare, but the question is only for one region (United States) so the currency is dollars. \n And we are not comparing across regions, so we don't need the currency conversion.\n\n So we only need one function call.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.

We have two options:\n   a) Try to include \"modern\" in the art_form string, e.g., \"modern sculpture\".\n   b) Ignore \"modern\" because the function doesn't support it? But that might not fulfill the task.\n\n Since the function description does not specify how art_form is used, we assume it can take a string that includes modifiers.\n\n So we will call:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n We are not providing month (so default to upcoming) and user_ratings (default to 'high').\n\n However, note: the function returns the most popular exhibitions. We are looking for the top rated, which is aligned with high user ratings.\n\n Therefore, we call:\n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")\n\n But note: the function has an argument `month` which we are omitting and `user_ratings` which we are also omitting.\n\n However, the function signature also has a default for `month` (which is to return upcoming events) and `user_ratings` (default 'high').\n\n We are not required to include parameters that have defaults? But the format requires that we only include the parameters we want to set? Or we can omit them.\n\n The instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n But here, the required parameters are `location` and `art_form`? Actually, the function does not mark any as required? But in the description, they are listed without saying optional except for `month` and `user_ratings` which have defaults.\n\n We are providing `location` and `art_form`, which are required for the search.\n\n Therefore, we can write the function call without the optional ones.\n\n But note: the format of the function call must be in XML. We are only including the parameters we are setting.\n\n However, the function expects `location` and `art_form` as arguments. We are setting both.\n\n We write:\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"find_exhibition\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n        <param name=\"art_form\" value=\"modern sculpture\" type=\"string\"/>\n     </params>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n But note: the function `find_exhibition` also has `month` and `user_ratings` as optional. We are not including them because we are using the defaults.\n\n However, what if the system expects the parameters in a specific order? The XML format we are using is by name, so order doesn't matter.\n\n Let's output the function call accordingly."}
