They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part: The user is changing the food item to Caesar salad. The original function parameters for ChaFod include foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"without anchovies,\" so I need to remove anchovies from the ingredients. The foodItem is \"Caesar salad.\" The removeIngredients should be \"anchovies.\" There's no mention of new ingredients, so newIngredients can be empty. Special instructions might be implied, but the user didn't specify any, so maybe leave that as default.\n\nThen for the drink: The drink ID is 123. The new preferences are large hot coffee, regular sweetness, and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink takes drink_id and new_preferences as a dict. So the new_preferences should be a dictionary with keys like \"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"type\": \"coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\". Need to structure that into a dict.\n\nCheck if all parameters are provided. For the food, the user provided the foodItem (Caesar salad), removeIngredients (anchovies). For the drink, drink_id is 123, and the new preferences are specified. So both functions can be called with the given parameters. No missing parameters here.

The user is asking for the latest news reports for two different locations: Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland. They want the news in English and specifically focusing on technology for the second one.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The get_news_report function can retrieve news based on location, category, and language. The parameters required are location, category, and language. The location needs to be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, France, since it's a city in a country, I can use 'Paris, France'. For Letterkenny, Ireland, it should be 'Letterkenny, Ireland' as well. The category for the second query is 'Technology', and the language is 'en' for both.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"again in English\" for the second query. So the first one is general news, and the second is technology. Wait, no, the user says \"focusing on technology news again in English\". So maybe the first one is general, but the second is technology. Wait, the original question says \"also for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news again in English\". So the first news report is for Paris, France, and the second is for Letterkenny, Ireland with category Technology. But the first one's category is not specified, so it should default to 'General' as per the function's default. \n\nSo I need to call get_news_report twice. First for Paris, France, category General, language en. Second for Letterkenny, Ireland, category Technology, language en. \n\nCheck if the parameters are correct. The location for Paris is 'Paris, France' which is valid. For Letterkenny, it's 'Letterkenny, Ireland'. The category for the second is 'Technology', and language is 'en'. \n\nSo the function calls would be two separate calls. Each with their respective parameters.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function clone_repo requires repo_url, destination, recursive, and depth. The default destination is current directory, so I'll use that. Recursive and depth aren't specified, so I'll leave them as default.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The function analyse_repo_contents needs directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, maybe the directory is 'nodejs-welcome'? Wait, the clone command's destination is default, so the repo would be in the current working directory. But the directory name might be the same as the repo name. So I'll use directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\" for analysis.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file requires directory_name. Again, probably the same directory as the repo. So directory_name=\"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nFor Kubernetes YAMLs, the function create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name, deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use defaults. Deployment name might default to the directory name, image_name to 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\nAfter creating files, the user says to add all changed files to git. But the functions provided don't have a 'add changes' function. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function does a git add and commit. But the user says \"add all changed files to git changes\" before committing. However, the available functions don't have a separate 'add' command. The push function does git add automatically. Maybe the user expects that after creating files, the push function will handle adding and committing. But the steps mention adding changes first, then committing/pushing. However, the available functions might not have a separate 'add' step. So perhaps the push function is used to add and commit. But the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" and then commit/push. Since the functions don't have an 'add' function, maybe the push function is used to add and commit. But the user might need to run the push function after creating the files. However, the push function's args are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, force_push. The directory_name here would be the same as the repo directory.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Clone repo.\n2. Analyze repo.\n3. Create Dockerfile.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs.\n5. Push changes.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says to add changes to git, then commit/push. Since the push function does git add and commit, maybe that's the way to go. So the functions called would be clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nNow, checking parameters:\n\nFor clone_repo, repo_url is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, destination is default (.), recursive default False, depth default (not provided, so maybe not included).\n\nanalyse_repo_contents: directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\ncreate_a_docker_file: directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file: directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\", deployment_name default (maybe same as directory?), image_name default 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, service_type 'ClusterIP'.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github: directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message default 'Update changes', branch_name 'main', force_push False.\n\nSo the function calls would be in order: clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github."}

They need to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories and also get the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned finding relevant classes, so the 'get_relevant_classes' function seems appropriate. The search string here would be 'CellResult', and since they want to include subdirectories, I should set include_subdirectories to True.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. But wait, the function requires the class name and method name. So I'll need to call get_signature twice: once for 'setCellValue' and once for 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. Also, the user might need to check if these methods are public or if they're private, but the default for include_private is False. However, the user's error might be related to method visibility, so maybe including private methods could help. But the user hasn't specified that, so I'll stick with the default unless told otherwise.\n\nWait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' not existing in 'CellResult'. Maybe the 'CellResult' class is part of a different package or module, and the user needs to check if that class is correctly imported. But the user's main request is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get the method signatures. So the first step is to use get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True. Then, use get_signature for the two methods in AbstractCellHandler.\n\nI should make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. For get_relevant_classes, the args are search_string, case_sensitive (default False), include_subdirectories (True here). Then for each method signature, class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue', include_private is default False unless needed. The user didn't mention private methods, so probably not necessary here.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult', include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's setCellValue.\n3. get_signature for AbstractCellHandler's getCellValue.\n\nThat should cover the user's needs. Let me check if there are any missing parameters. The get_relevant_classes function requires search_string, which is provided. The other parameters have defaults. The get_signature requires class_name, method_name, and include_private (optional). Since the user hasn't specified including private methods, we can leave include_private as default False.\n\nSo the tool calls would be these three functions."}

The unit is cm, but the function doesn't require units, just the numerical value. So I'll call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. That might be a mistake. However, the function get_current_weather requires a location in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. The user said Queenstown Singapore, which is a bit confusing. But maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore by mistake. However, the function can take 'Country' as part of the location. So I'll use the location parameter as \"Queenstown, Singapore\" even if it's likely a typo. The unit is not specified, so the default is Fahrenheit.

Then call it again with event_type=\"play\", same city and date. \n\nWait, the city parameter in the function can be \"Los Angeles\" or \"Los Angeles, CA\"? The function's example uses \"New York, NY\" or \"Paris\". So maybe the city should be formatted as \"Los Angeles, CA\". \n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nFor concerts:\nevent_type=\"concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\"\n\nFor plays:\nevent_type=\"play\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\"\n\nSo two function calls. But the user might not have specified the state, but the function examples include the state abbreviation. So I should use \"Los Angeles, CA\" as the city parameter.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to make two separate calls to Events_3_FindEvents with each event type."}

They want two things: first, to search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and second, to book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon at 15:00 on 2023-05-10.\n\nStarting with the first part, the user is asking to search for a hair stylist. Looking at the available functions, there's Services_1_FindProvider which requires the city and an optional is_unisex parameter. The city here is Sunnyvale, CA, formatted as 'Sunnyvale, CA'. The user didn't mention anything about the salon being unisex, so I'll set is_unisex to 'dontcare' as per the default.\n\nNext, booking the appointment. The function Services_1_BookAppointment needs the stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user specified 'Elegant Styles' as the salon, so that's the stylist_name. The time is 15:00, which is in 24-hour format, and the date is 2023-05-10. All parameters are provided here.\n\nWait, but the first function is to search for a stylist, which might return a list of providers. However, the user directly mentions booking with 'Elegant Styles', so maybe they already know the salon's name. But the first part of the question is to search, so I need to call FindProvider first. However, the user might be combining both actions. So I need to make two separate function calls: one to find the provider in Sunnyvale, and another to book the appointment with the specified salon.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"search for a hair stylist in Sunnyvale, CA, and also book an appointment with 'Elegant Styles' salon\". So the search is separate from the booking. So first, call Services_1_FindProvider with city 'Sunnyvale, CA' and is_unisex 'dontcare'. Then, call Services_1_BookAppointment with stylist_name 'Elegant Styles', time 15:00, date 2023-05-10.\n\nBut the user might be expecting that the booking is with the found stylist. However, the user explicitly mentions the salon name, so the booking is for 'Elegant Styles', which might be a salon in Sunnyvale. So the two functions are separate. Therefore, I need to make both function calls."}
