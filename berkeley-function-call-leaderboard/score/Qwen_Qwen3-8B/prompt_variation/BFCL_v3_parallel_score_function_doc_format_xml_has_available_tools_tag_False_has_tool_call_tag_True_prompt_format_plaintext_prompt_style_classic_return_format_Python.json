The user wants me to calculate the HCF of several pairs of numbers and then use those results to find more HCFs. Let me break down each part.\n\nFirst, they asked for the HCF of (45, 60). I remember that HCF, or greatest common divisor, is the largest number that divides both numbers without a remainder. For 45 and 60, I can use the math.hcf function. Let me check the parameters: it needs two integers. So, I'll call math.hcf with number1=45 and number2=60. The result of that should be 15.\n\nNext, they want to use that result (which is 15) to find the HCF with another pair (90, 120). Wait, no, actually the question says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The original instruction says: first calculate HCF of (45,60), then use that result to find HCF with (90,120). Wait, does that mean take the previous result (15) and find HCF of 15 with 90 and 120?
