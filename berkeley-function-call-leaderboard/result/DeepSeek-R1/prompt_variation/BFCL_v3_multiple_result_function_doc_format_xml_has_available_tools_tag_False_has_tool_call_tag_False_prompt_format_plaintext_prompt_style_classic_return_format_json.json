However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current price in the store for that platform and region. \n Since the PlayStation Store in the United States is a single store, there should be one price.

The function does not specify edition, so we assume the base game. \n The function `video_games.store_price` might return the base game price.

But we don't have final_speed (that's what we are solving for) and we are missing two required parameters (final_speed is required and we don't have it). So we cannot use this because we don't know the final speed.\n\n2. kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest:\n   The description says: \"Calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest under a constant acceleration over a specified distance.\"\n   This seems to fit our scenario.\n\n   The parameters for kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest are:\n   - distance (integer, required): we have 20 meters.\n   - time (integer, required): we have 4 seconds.\n   - initial_speed (integer, optional): since it starts from rest, we can set it to 0, but it is optional. However, the function description says it calculates the speed (which we assume is the final speed) for an object starting from rest. Even though the initial_speed is optional, we can provide it as 0 to be explicit.\n\n   But note: the function parameters require integers. Our distance and time are 20 and 4, which are integers.\n\n   However, the function name and description suggest that it might be using one of the kinematic equations for an object starting from rest. There are two common equations for motion from rest under constant acceleration:\n   - v = u + at  -> but we don't have acceleration.\n   - v^2 = u^2 + 2as -> but we don't have acceleration and we have distance and time? \n   Alternatively, we might use: s = (u+v)*t/2 -> which becomes s = (0+v)*t/2 -> so v = 2s/t.\n\n   Let's assume the function uses the equation: v = 2s/t? But note that this equation only holds when initial velocity is zero and acceleration is constant? Actually, the equation s = (u+v)/2 * t is the average velocity multiplied by time. Since u=0, then s = (v/2)*t -> so v = 2s/t.\n\n   Therefore, we can use this function by providing:\n   - distance: 20\n   - time: 4\n   - initial_speed: 0 (optional, but we can provide to be safe)\n\n   However, the function does not require initial_speed? It is optional. But the description says \"starts from rest\", so if we don't provide it, it should assume 0. But to be safe, we can provide it.\n\n   But note: the function expects integers and we have integers.\n\n   Alternatively, the function might be using a different equation? The description doesn't specify the exact equation. But the problem states constant acceleration and starting from rest.\n\n   We have two knowns: distance and time, and we are to find the final speed.\n\n   We can use the function: kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with parameters: distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0.\n\n   However, the function's parameters are named and we must use the exact names.\n\n   Let's look at the function signature again:\n\n   <function name=\"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\">\n     <params>\n        <param name=\"distance\" type=\"integer\" required=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"time\" type=\"integer\" required=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"initial_speed\" type=\"integer\" required=\"false\" />\n     </params>\n   </function>\n\n   We are going to call:\n      function: kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\n      parameters: \n          distance: 20\n          time: 4\n          initial_speed: 0\n\n   But note: the function returns the speed? The description says it calculates the speed (which we assume is the final speed).\n\n   Therefore, we can use this function.\n\nHowever, let's double-check: the problem says \"how fast an object was going\" meaning the final speed.\n\nSo we will call the function accordingly.\n\nBut note: the function expects integers, and we are providing integers.\n\nTherefore, the function call in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[{\"function\":\"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\",\"parameters\":{\"distance\":20,\"time\":4,\"initial_speed\":0}}]\n```\n\nHowever, the function does not require initial_speed? It is optional. But since we know it is 0, we can include it to be explicit. Alternatively, we can omit it? The function description says \"starts from rest\", so it might assume 0. But the problem says \"started from rest\", so we are safe.\n\nBut to be safe, we include it because the problem states it started from rest.\n\nAlternatively, if we omit it, the function might still work. But the parameter is optional, so we can omit. However, the function might require it to be present? The parameter is required=\"false\", meaning we can omit. So we can do:\n\nOption 1: with initial_speed=0\nOption 2: without initial_speed\n\nBut the problem says \"started from rest\", so initial_speed is 0. Including it is more explicit.\n\nI think including it is better.\n\nBut note: the function expects type integer for initial_speed? Yes, and 0 is an integer.\n\nTherefore, we will include it.\n\nLet me write the function call accordingly."}

But we don't know the allowed values. \n Alternatively, we can set user_ratings to \"top\" or \"highest\"? \n\n Let's assume the function accepts \"top\" as a value? We can try:\n\n   user_ratings: \"top\"\n\n But the description says the default is 'high'. We don't know if \"top\" is allowed. \n\n Given the risk of using an unsupported value, we stick to the default.\n\n Alternatively, we can leave it out and let it default to 'high'. \n\n So, we stick to:\n\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   art_form: \"modern sculpture\"\n\n And omit the other parameters.\n\n If the function returns nothing, then we might have to adjust in a future turn? But we are only in one turn.\n\n Therefore, we output the function call as above."}
