Let me translate it:\n\n- \"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0\" means \"Living room, Air conditioner, Turn on\" or \"Execute\".\n\n- \"\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\" means \"Bedroom, Air purifier, Stop it please\".\n\nSo, the user wants to:\n\n1. Turn on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n2. Stop the air purifier in the bedroom.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions, I need to see which one matches this.\n\nThe relevant function is: 'ControlAppliance.execute'\n\n- Description: This is for controlling home appliances, like checking status or executing commands.\n\n- Parameters: It requires a 'command' which is a string in Korean, consisting of room name, appliance name, and operation command, separated by commas.\n\n- Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner in the living room.\n\n- Enum: ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0']\n\nThe user's request has two parts, but the function seems to handle one command at a time. I need to make separate calls for each command.\n\nThe enum only has specific examples, and the user's commands are:\n\n1. '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' \u2013 This matches exactly with the enum.\n\n2. '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' \u2013 This isn't directly in the enum, but the description says examples like that, so it should be acceptable as long as it's in the correct format.\n\nThe parameters specify that 'command' must be one of the enum values, which are only those three. But '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' isn't in the enum. The enum is: ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0']\n\nOh, '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' is similar, so perhaps the enum is just examples, but in the function definition, it's listed as enum, which means it might only accept those exact strings.\n\nIn the function parameters: 'enum': ['\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589', ', \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \ub0c9\ubc29 \uc2e4\ud589', '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0']\n\nThis means the 'command' parameter can only be one of these exact strings. So, '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' is not in the enum, so I can't use it directly.\n\nThat might be a problem. Does that mean I can't execute the second command?\n\nThe description says: \"The command must be specified as a string in Korean, consisting of the room name, appliance name (or alias), and operation command, separated by commas. Examples: ...\"\n\nBut the parameters strictly have an enum, so I have to stick to that.\n\nFor the first part: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' \u2013 This is in the enum, so I can call the function with that.\n\nFor the second: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0' \u2013 Not in the enum, so I can't call it.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But I have to respond only with function calls or nothing.\n\nMore precisely: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But in this case, I can use it for the first command.\n\nI need to make function calls for what I can. So, I should call it for the first command.\n\nThe user has two requests. I might need to make two separate calls, but since the second isn't exact, I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can only call for the valid one.\n\nThe response format: I should only return function calls in the specified format.\n\nAt each turn, I should try to complete the tasks.\n\nSo, for now, I can call the function for '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'.\n\nAfter that, in subsequent turns, I might handle the rest, but the system says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSince I can only do one, I'll do that.\n\nThe function might be called multiple times in one response. The format allows an array of function calls.\n\nSo, I could try to call it twice: once for each, but the second isn't in the enum, so it might not work.\n\nThe enum limits it, so if I try to pass '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0', it won't match.\n\nI should only call for the valid one.\n\nPerhaps the enum is not exhaustive, but according to the definition, it is.\n\nIn the function definition, it's 'enum', so I have to use exactly those.\n\nFor this response, I'll only call for the first command.\n\nMy response should be: <TOOLCALL> with the JSON for that function call.\n\nJSON format: [{\"function\":\"ControlAppliance.execute\",\"parameters\":{\"command\":\"\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589\"}}]\n\nThat seems right.\n\nThe user said \"\uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0\ud574\uc918\", so it's two commands in one sentence. But I can only handle the first.\n\nI need to handle both if possible, but since I can't, I'll just do what I can.\n\nI think that's it."}

It requires:\n\n  - location: In the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'.\n\n  - category: Optional, defaults to 'General', but can be 'Technology'.\n\n  - language: Optional, defaults to 'en' (English).\n\nFor Paris, France: The location should be 'Paris, France' since it's a country, not a state.\n\nFor Letterkenny, Ireland: Similarly, 'Letterkenny, Ireland'.\n\nThe user wants technology news for Letterkenny, so I need to specify category as 'Technology'.\n\nFor both, language should be 'en' for English.\n\nI need to make function calls. The instructions say I can make one or more function calls in a single response, formatted in <TOOLCALL> with JSON.\n\nEach call to get_news_report will retrieve news for one location. So, I should make two separate calls: one for Paris and one for Letterkenny.\n\nParameters for each:\n\n1. For Paris:\n\n   - location: 'Paris, France'\n\n   - category: Not specified, so it defaults to 'General'. The user didn't specify a category for Paris, only for Letterkenny.\n\n   - language: 'en'\n\n2. For Letterkenny:\n\n   - location: 'Letterkenny, Ireland'\n\n   - category: 'Technology'\n\n   - language: 'en'\n\nThe function description says: \"The location for which to get the news, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'San Francisco, CA'. State needs to be in short form. If state not available in use 'City, Country'\"\n\nFor Paris, France: No state, so 'Paris, France' is fine.\n\nFor Letterkenny, Ireland: Ireland doesn't have states in the same way, so 'Letterkenny, Ireland' should work as per the description.\n\nIn my response, I need to output only the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array of function calls.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<ToolCALL>\n\n```json\n\n[\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name1\", \"parameters\": {...}},\n\n  {\"function\": \"func_name2\", \"parameters\": {...}}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nSo, for this, I'll have two objects in the array.\n\nI should make both calls in this turn since the user asked for both.\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON is correctly formatted."}

Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI have the following tools available:\n\n- clone_repo: This can clone the repository.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This generates Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This analyzes the repo contents.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This pushes changes, and it automatically adds all changes.\n\nThe push_git_changes_to_github function says it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 4 (add all changed files) and step 5 (commit and push).\n\nI need to sequence these calls because the system might handle one turn at a time, but the instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I should output all necessary function calls in this response if possible.\n\nLet me outline the sequence:\n\n1. First, clone the repo. I need to call clone_repo with the repo_url.\n\n2. After cloning, analyze the repo contents. So, call analyse_repo_contents with the directory name. From the clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it defaults to '.', but I should specify it for clarity.\n\n   In clone_repo, the destination defaults to '.', which is the current working directory. But to make it clear, I can specify a directory name, say 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file requires a directory_name, which should be where the repo is cloned.\n\n4. Then, create the Kubernetes YAML file, which also requires a directory_name.\n\n5. Finally, push the changes using push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nThe analyse_repo_contents will give me information about the predominant language, which might be used implicitly by the other functions, but from the descriptions, create_a_docker_file and create_kubernetes_yaml_file don't directly take the analysis output as input. I assume that when I call them, they will use the analysis if needed, but based on the tools, I just need to call them after analysis.\n\nIn the user's request, it says \"create/update dockerfile based on the analysis\", but my tools don't have a direct way to pass analysis results. I think I just need to call the functions in sequence.\n\nFor clone_repo, I need to provide repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\nI should specify a destination, like 'nodejs-welcome', so that I can reference it later.\n\nThen, for analyse_repo_contents, directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\nFor create_a_docker_file, directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome'\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome' (and other parameters if needed, but they have defaults)\n\nFinally, for push_git_changes_to_github, directory_name: 'nodejs-welcome', and perhaps a commit message.\n\nThe user didn't specify a commit message, so I can use the default.\n\nIn one response, I can make multiple function calls by listing them in the JSON array.\n\nSo, my response should be a <TOOLCALL> with a JSON array of function calls.\n\nI need to call them in the correct order. Since the system might execute them sequentially, I should list them in order.\n\nThe format is an array of objects, so I can have multiple.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n\n2. Analyze.\n\n3. Create Dockerfile.\n\n4. Create Kubernetes YAML.\n\n5. Push changes.\n\nOne potential issue: The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires parameters like deployment_name, etc., which have defaults, so I can use defaults.\n\nAlright, let's prepare the JSON.\n\nFirst function: clone_repo\n\nParameters: {\n\n  \"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\",\n\n  \"destination\": \"nodejs-welcome\"  // I'll specify this for clarity\n\n}\n\nSecond: analyse_repo_contents\n\nParameters: {\n\n  \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n}\n\nThird: create_a_docker_file\n\nParameters: {\n\n  \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n}\n\nFourth: create_kubernetes_yaml_file\n\nParameters: {\n\n  \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\"\n\n  // Use defaults for others\n\n}\n\nFifth: push_git_changes_to_github\n\nParameters: {\n\n  \"directory_name\": \"nodejs-welcome\",\n\n  \"commit_message\": \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML\"  // I can suggest a message\n\n}\n\nThe default commit_message is \"Update changes\", but I can override it.\n\nFinally, output in the specified format."}

The search_engine.query is perfect for this because it can handle searches and filter by year.\n\nThe prompt they gave is: \"significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021\". That seems like a typo; probably means \"since October 2021\". I can use that as the search query.\n\nI need to set 'include_after_year' to True to filter for post-2022.\n\nFor the second part: They want to generate an image. The description is of a human subject (a masked woman), so generate_human_image might be more appropriate as it's tailored for human images.\n\ngenerate_human_image: \"Generates a digital image of a human subject... tailored to create images representing different human demographics such as girls, boys, women, men, and children.\"\n\nThis fits perfectly.\n\ngenerate_image is more general, but since this is specifically a human, I should use generate_human_image.\n\nSo, I need to make two function calls:\n\n1. search_engine.query with the appropriate parameters.\n\n2. generate_human_image with the image description.\n\nThe user said: \"a digital painting of a masked woman...\" and it's detailed, so prompt for generate_human_image.\n\nFormat: I must output only the <TOOLCALL> section with the JSON array of function calls.\n\nEach function call should be in the specified JSON format.\n\nSince there are two functions, I'll include both in a single array.\n\nThe instruction: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So, I can call both in this response.\n\nStructure:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n```\n\n[\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"search_engine.query\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"prompt\": \"significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021\",\n\n\"include_after_year\": True\n\n}\n\n},\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"generate_human_image\",\n\n\"parameters\": {\n\n\"prompt\": \"a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n]\n\n```\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nFor search_engine.query, the prompt should be verbatim as per the user, but I corrected \"that since October 2021\" to \"since October 2021\" for clarity, as it's likely a typo.\n\nThe user said: \"significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021\".

The send_message function is for sending messages to a human user.\n\nThe user says \"regardless,\" which might mean send the message even if I don't find the birthday. So, I should proceed to send the message after attempting to search.\n\nMy response should only include function calls in the specified format.

Search for the birthday.\n\n2. Send the message regardless.\n\nSince I can't conditionally call functions in one go, I should start with the search.\n\nThe function recall_memory_search has an optional 'request_heartbeat' which can be set to true to trigger follow-up actions.\n\nFor send_message, I need to know the recipient. The function has a 'recipient' parameter with a default of 'default@example.com', but the user mentioned \"Shishir\", so I should use that if possible.\n\nThe user didn't specify the recipient's identifier.

Probably.\n\nSo, let's go with that.\n\nFinal plan: Make a TOOLCALL with an array containing two functions:\n\n1. recall_memory_search with query = \"Shishir's birthday\" or something similar, and request_heartbeat = True.\n\n2. send_message with message = \"Happy Birthday!\", recipient = \"Shishir\", urgent = True or False, default is False.\n\nThe user said \"congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message\", so message = \"Happy Birthday!\".\n\nAlright, let's format it."}
