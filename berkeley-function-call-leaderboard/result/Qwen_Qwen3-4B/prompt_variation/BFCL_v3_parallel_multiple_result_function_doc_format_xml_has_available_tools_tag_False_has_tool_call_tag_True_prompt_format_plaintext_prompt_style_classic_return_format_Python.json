The data_loading function is for loading the CSV file, so I should call that first to get the data into a structure. The parameters for data_loading are file_path and delimiter. The user didn't specify a delimiter, so I'll assume the default, maybe a comma since it's a common delimiter for CSVs.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, the next step is to use the linear_regression_fit function. The parameters required are x and y, which are arrays. The user specified x as data['sales'] and y as data['future_sales'], so after loading the data, I need to extract those columns. Also, the return_residuals parameter should be set to True as the user wants the residuals.\n\nSo the steps are: first load the data using data_loading with the file path 'dataset.csv', then pass the relevant columns to linear_regression_fit with return_residuals=True.

The user is asking for the average price of two different sculptures: a 4 ft x 4 ft marble statue in the Philadelphia museum and a 6 ft x 3 ft bronze sculpture in the New York museum. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The available functions are get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. \n\nThe get_sculpture_details function requires the museum location and sculpture ID. But the user hasn't provided sculpture IDs, only the dimensions and materials. So maybe that function isn't directly useful here unless we need to get details first. However, the user is asking about price, which relates to the get_artwork_price function. \n\nLooking at get_artwork_price, it needs museum location, material, and size. The user provided both materials (marble and bronze) and sizes (4x4 and 6x3), along with locations (Philadelphia and New York). So for each sculpture, I can call get_artwork_price with those parameters. \n\nWait, but the function parameters for get_artwork_price require the size as an array. The user provided sizes as \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to parse those into arrays. For the first sculpture, the size would be [4,4], and the second [6,3]. But the function expects an array of numbers, so maybe the user's input needs to be converted into numerical values. \n\nBut the user's question is about the average price of both sculptures. So I need to call get_artwork_price twice: once for each sculpture. Each call would have the respective museum location, material, and size. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the function might not have access to actual price data, but the user is asking for the average. But according to the function's description, it retrieves the price based on size and material. So assuming the function can calculate or retrieve that data, I need to make two separate calls. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For the marble statue in Philadelphia: call get_artwork_price with museum_location=\"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material=\"marble\", sculpture_size=[4,4].\n2. For the bronze sculpture in New York: call get_artwork_price with museum_location=\"New York\", sculpture_material=\"bronze\", sculpture_size=[6,3].\n\nThen, once I have both prices, I can average them. But the user's question is phrased as \"average price\", so maybe the functions return individual prices, and then the assistant would compute the average. However, the user's instruction says to make function calls, not to compute the average. So the assistant should make the two calls, and then in the next step, compute the average. But according to the problem, the assistant should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section. \n\nSo the answer would be two function calls. Each with the respective parameters. The user didn't mention any sculpture IDs, so the get_sculpture_details function isn't needed here. The get_artwork_price is the right choice."}

The parameters needed are mols, substance, and optionally joules_per_mol. The glucose formula is C6H12O6, and the default joules per mol is 2800, which matches the problem statement. So I'll call calc_energy with mols=5, substance=\"C6H12O6\", and joules_per_mol=2800.\n\nNext, they need the biomass from the energy and efficiency. The function biological.calc_biomass takes energy and efficiency. The energy from the first step is the total energy, and efficiency is 10% or 0.10.

The problem states that John is investing $5000 for 5 years at 4% annual rate. The function calc_Simple_Interest requires principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So I'll plug in 5000 for principle, 5 for duration, and 4 for the rate. That should give the simple interest return.\n\nNext, the compound interest option. Here, the principal is $5000 again, duration 5 years, annual rate 3.5%, and it compounds annually. The calc_Compound_Interest function needs principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1. So parameters would be 5000, 5, 3.5, and 1.\n\nThird option is using the future_value function. The initial investment here is $3000, annual rate 5%, time 6 years, compounded twice a year. The future_value function requires initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The rate is 5%, so as a decimal that's 0.05. Time is 6 years, and num_compoundings is 2 since it's compounded twice a year. Wait, but the function's interest_rate parameter is a decimal, so 5% becomes 0.05. Also, the time is in years, but the function's time parameter is an integer. Wait, the description says \"number of time periods the money is invested for.\" Hmm, but the example given for the third option is 6 years. So maybe the time is 6, and num_compoundings is 2. So the parameters would be initial_investment=3000, interest_rate=0.05, time=6, num_compoundings=2.\n\nWait, but the third option's description says \"annual interest rate of 5% for 6 years with interest compounded twice a year.\" So the future_value function is supposed to calculate that. The function's parameters are initial_investment, interest_rate (as decimal), time (number of periods), and num_compoundings. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo I need to make three separate function calls: one for each of the three options. Let me check if all parameters are provided.

The parameters needed are country and century. France is the country, and the 17th century would be century 17. Wait, the function's example says for 1700s, input 18.

They have four separate requests here, so I need to handle each one individually.\n\nFirst, they want to know the types of fish collectable in 'Animal Crossing' during the 'Summer' season. Looking at the available functions, the 'get_collectables_in_season' function seems right. It requires game_name, season, and item_type. The user specified 'fish' as the item type, so I'll set item_type to 'fish'.\n\nNext, they're asking for the highest score in 'Fortnite' on PlayStation in the Asia region. The 'game_score.highest' function requires game, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game is 'Fortnite', platform is 'Playstation', and region is 'Asia'. So that's straightforward.\n\nThird, they need details of lawsuits against 'Apple Inc.' in 2018. The 'lawsuit_details.find' function needs company_name and year. The user provided both, so that's covered. The case_type is optional, so I can leave it out.\n\nLastly, calculating a binomial probability with 10 trials, 3 successes, and a 0.7 probability. The 'calculate_binomial_probability' function requires number_of_trials, number_of_successes, and probability_of_success. All parameters are provided here.\n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly mapped and that no required parameters are missing. Each function call should be in the correct format. Let me check each one again to confirm. Yep, all required parameters are present. Now, structure each function call in the specified XML format."}
