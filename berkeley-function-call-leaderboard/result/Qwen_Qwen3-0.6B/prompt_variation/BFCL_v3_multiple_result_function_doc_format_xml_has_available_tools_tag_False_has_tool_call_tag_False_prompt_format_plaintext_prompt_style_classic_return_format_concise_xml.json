The question is about displacement, so the first function is the right choice. \n\nLooking at the parameters for calculate_displacement: initial_speed, acceleration, time, and rounding. The user provided initial_speed as 20, acceleration as 10, time as 5. All required parameters are there. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it out. \n\nSo the function call should include initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5. No other parameters needed. The other function is for final speed, which isn't required here. \n\nI should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as integers or floats.

Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, and time is 4 seconds. The question is asking for the final speed, which would be the final velocity.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check its parameters. The function requires distance, time, and optionally initial speed. The user provided all three: distance 20, time 4, and since it starts from rest, initial speed is 0. \n\nWait, the parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). So I can use this function. The parameters are all provided, so I can call it with those values. The function should compute the speed using the formula v = u + at, where u is initial velocity (0 here), a is acceleration, and t is time. Since distance is given, maybe the function uses that to compute acceleration first. \n\nAlternatively, the other function calculate_acceleration might be useful if we need acceleration first, but the question is about speed, not acceleration. So the correct function here is calculate_speed_from_rest. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly set. The distance is 20, time is 4, and initial speed is 0.

But the problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. Wait, maybe the height is 12 feet? Or is the height not specified? Wait, the problem says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet.

But the problem statement says the wall is 30 feet by 12 feet. Wait, maybe the height is 12 feet. Let me think. If the wall is 30 feet long and 12 feet wide, then the area is 30*12=360 square feet.

But the problem says the wall is 30x12, so maybe the height is 12. So the parameters would be coverage_rate=400, length=30, height=12. Then calculate_paint_needed would be called with those values.
