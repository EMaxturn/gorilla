The facilities array includes options like Wi-Fi, Reading Room, Fiction, Children Section, and Cafe. \n\nFor New York: location is New York, NY, facilities should be ['Reading Room', 'Fiction']. \n\nFor Los Angeles: location is Los Angeles, CA, facilities are ['Wi-Fi', 'Children Section'].\n\nFor Chicago: location is Chicago, IL, facilities are ['Cafe', 'Reading Room'].\n\nEach of these parameters needs to be passed as a separate function call. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so these are the required ones. I need to make sure each function call is correctly formatted with the parameters as specified."}
