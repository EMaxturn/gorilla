The user provided all three required parameters: 20, 10, and 5. The rounding is optional, and since it's not mentioned, I can omit it or set to default. The function should handle the calculation using the formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Plugging in the values: 20*5 + 0.5*10*25 = 100 + 125 = 225 meters.

The user is asking to find the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question says the object started from rest, so initial speed is 0. The function calculate_speed_from_rest seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. It requires distance (integer) and time (integer), which the user provided: 20 meters and 4 seconds. The initial_speed is optional but since it's from rest, it's 0. But the function's parameters say initial_speed is an integer, but the user didn't mention it. However, since it's optional, maybe we can omit it. Wait, no, the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as optional, but the user's problem states it started from rest, so we should include it as 0. Wait, but the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as an integer, but in the user's case, it's 0. So I need to pass distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But wait, looking back at the function definition for calculate_speed_from_rest: the parameters are distance (required), time (required), and initial_speed (optional). So the user's problem has all the required parameters. So the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But wait, the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest have initial_speed as an integer. The user's problem says the object started from rest, so initial_speed is 0. Therefore, the function call should include all three parameters. But wait, the function's parameters for calculate_speed_from_rest: initial_speed is an integer, but in the user's case, it's 0. So the function call would be:\n\n<function name=\"kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest\">\n  <params>\n    <param name=\"distance\" value=\"20\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    <param name=\"time\" value=\"4\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    <param name=\"initial_speed\" value=\"0\" type=\"integer\"/>\n  </params>\n</function>\n\nBut wait, the user didn't mention initial_speed, but since it's from rest, it's 0. So that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the function can calculate it even if initial_speed is not provided, but according to the function's parameters, initial_speed is optional. However, since the problem states it started from rest, we need to include it. So the correct function call is calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters."}

Since they're the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of thermal energy. The formula is (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2), where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters.

The user specified \"modern sculpture,\" so art_form should be \"sculpture\" and location \"New York, NY.\" The month is \"upcoming,\" which the function can handle as the default. User ratings are mentioned as \"top rated,\" so I should set user_ratings to \"high\" as per the function's parameter description.\n\nWait, the function find_exhibition has user_ratings as a parameter with a default of 'high'. The user is asking for top-rated, so using the default 'high' makes sense here. The month parameter is optional, but since the user mentions \"upcoming month,\" maybe we can leave it out, as the default would return upcoming events. But the function's description says if month is provided, it uses that; otherwise, it returns upcoming. So maybe including month as \"upcoming\" is better, but the parameter expects a string like \"June\" or \"July\". However, the user says \"upcoming month,\" which might not be a specific month. The function's default is to return upcoming events if month is not provided. So perhaps we can omit the month parameter. \n\nSo the parameters would be location: \"New York, NY\", art_form: \"sculpture\", user_ratings: \"high\". The month is optional and can be left out. Therefore, the function call should be find_exhibition with those parameters. \n\nI don't think any other functions are needed here.
