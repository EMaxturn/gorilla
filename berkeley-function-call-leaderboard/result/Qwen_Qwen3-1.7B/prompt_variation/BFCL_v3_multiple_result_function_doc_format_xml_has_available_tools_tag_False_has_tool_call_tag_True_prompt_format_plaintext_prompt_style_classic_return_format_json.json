The displacement function requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The calculate_final_speed needs the same parameters but returns the final speed. Since the user is asking for displacement, I should use calculate_displacement.\n\nCheck the parameters: all required ones are provided. Initial speed is 20, acceleration 10, time 5.

The user is asking for the cheapest selling price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' in the PlayStation Store in the United States.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's the video_games.on_sale function, which checks if a game is on sale, and video_games.store_price, which fetches the selling price. The user wants the cheapest price, so maybe store_price is the right one. But wait, the on_sale function might indicate if it's on sale, but the user is asking for the cheapest price, which could be the regular price or the sale price. However, the question is about the cheapest selling price, so maybe the store_price function gives the actual price, and on_sale just tells if it's discounted. But the user might want the regular price, not the sale price. Hmm.\n\nBut the functions available don't have a function that directly gives the cheapest price. The store_price function gives the selling price, which could be the regular price or the sale price. The user might want the regular price, but the question is a bit ambiguous. However, since the user is asking for the cheapest selling price, perhaps the store_price function is the one to use. But I need to check the parameters. The store_price function requires game_title, platform, and region. The user provided all three: game_title is 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform is PlayStation, region is United States. So I should call store_price with those parameters. The on_sale function might not be necessary here unless the user wants to know if it's on sale, but the question is about the cheapest price, which could be the sale price. However, the user might be referring to the regular price. But since the question is about the cheapest selling price, maybe the store_price function is the correct one. So I'll call store_price with the given parameters."}

The user is asking to find out the speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about finding the final speed.\n\nThe formula that relates distance, initial speed, final speed, and time is: \ndistance = (initial_speed * time) + (0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2). \nBut since initial_speed is 0, it simplifies to distance = 0.5 * acceleration * time\u00b2. \nSolving for acceleration would give acceleration = 2 * distance / time\u00b2. Then, final speed can be found using v = u + at, where u is initial speed (0), so v = a * t. \n\nBut wait, the user might be expecting the use of a provided function. Let me check the available functions. There's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which takes distance, time, and initial_speed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function's parameters are distance (integer), time (integer), and initial_speed (optional). So, the user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds. The function should calculate the speed using those parameters. \n\nSo, the function call would be to 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance 20, time 4, and initial_speed 0. But the initial_speed is optional, so maybe it's allowed to omit it. However, the function's parameters require distance and time as required, and initial_speed is optional. So, the call should include distance and time, and initial_speed if needed. Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to calculate_speed_from_rest with distance 20, time 4, and initial_speed 0. That should give the final speed."}

So I just need to call the calculate_final_temperature function with these parameters. The other function, calculate_mass, isn't relevant here since the question is about temperature mixing, not mass.

The function requires desired_sum, sides_per_die, and optionally n_rolls. The user is asking for a sum of 7 with two dice. So desired_sum is 7. The sides_per_die should be 6 because standard dice have 6 sides. The n_rolls is 2 since they're rolling two dice. The default for n_rolls is 1, but here it's 2.

The stock_market_data is for stock market data, which might include dividends but not necessarily the historical payments.\n\nThe parameters for dividend_data require the company name, years, and optionally the frequency. The user mentioned \"last five years,\" so the years parameter should be 5. The company is Apple Inc, so that's the company parameter.

So 30 feet times 12 feet equals 360 square feet. \n\nNext, the coverage rate is 400 square feet per gallon. To find out how many gallons are needed, I divide the total area by the coverage rate.
