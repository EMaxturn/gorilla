I can specify it if needed.\n\nThe user wants both status and scheduled trial date, which aligns with what the function provides.\n\nI need to make function calls for each case separately because the function only takes one case_number at a time.\n\nThe response format must be: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)...]\n\nI should only return the function calls, nothing else.\n\nFor the first case:\n\n- case_number: 'XY1234'\n\n- court: 'Los Angeles County Court'\n\n- details: Since they want status and trial date, I can use the default or specify something like 'status and trial dates'. The description says it defaults to 'status', and the function is designed to get status and trial dates, so I'll assume the default works. To be precise, the docstring says: \"Retrieves the status and trial dates\", so even with default, it should get both.\n\nThe docstring: \"Retrieves the status and trial dates for court cases from specified county courts.\"\n\nAnd details defaults to '', which might mean 'status'. To be safe, I can set details to 'status and trial dates' if it allows, but the parameter is described as \"Specific details required about the court case. Defaults to 'status'.\"\n\nIt says defaults to 'status', but the function retrieves status and trial dates. Maybe 'status' includes trial dates. I'll use the default for now.\n\nFor the second case:\n\n- case_number: 'GH5678'\n\n- court: 'Orange County Court'\n\n- details: Same as above.\n\nI need to call the function twice, once for each case.\n\nMy response should be: [court_info_get_case_status(case_number='XY1234', court='Los Angeles County Court'), court_info_get_case_status(case_number='GH5678', court='Orange County Court')]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

The user specified \"New York District court\", so I can use \"New York District court\" for this.\n\n- case_number (array): This is an array of unique case numbers.

The function requires a, b, c as integers, and they are all integers in the query.\n\nNo missing parameters.\n\nMy response should only contain the function calls in the specified format, nothing else.\n\nSo, the exact format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params), ...]\n\nTherefore, I'll output:\n\n[solve_quadratic(a=2, b=5, c=3), solve_quadratic(a=1, b=-3, c=2, root_type='real'), solve_quadratic(a=4, b=-7, c=3), solve_quadratic(a=1, b=2, c=1, root_type='real')]\n\nThat should cover it."}

Evaluate that at x=2: calculate_derivative(function='18x - 4', x_value=2)\n\nThe user said: \"calculate the derivative of the resulting function and evaluate it at x=2\", and the resulting function is the first derivative.\n\nTo clarify, I need to:\n\n- First call to get the first derivative function.\n\n- Second call to evaluate the first derivative at x=4.\n\n- Third call to get the second derivative (derivative of the first derivative).\n\n- Fourth call to evaluate the second derivative at x=2.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nSince I don't have the actual output, I need to assume that the function returns the derivative as a string that I can use in the next call.\n\nIn my response, I have to output the function calls sequentially.\n\nThe format allows multiple: [func1, func2, etc.]\n\nSo, I can do that.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. First: calculate_derivative(function='3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7')  # This gets the first derivative function, say deriv1\n\n2. Then: calculate_derivative(function=deriv1, x_value=4)  # But I don't know deriv1 yet. In my response, I have to specify the parameters now.\n\nThat's a problem. I can't refer to the output of the previous call in my current response because the system executes them sequentially, but in my output, I need to write the calls as is.\n\nThe instructions don't specify how to handle dependencies. I think I need to output all calls, and the system will execute them in order.\n\nIn the format, it's just a list of calls, so perhaps: [call1, call2, call3, call4]\n\nFor call2, I need the output of call1 as the function parameter.\n\nThis might not work directly. Perhaps the system is designed to handle that, or maybe I need to assume that the functions are independent.\n\nPerhaps I need to make calls that don't depend on previous outputs in this way.\n\nAnother way: since the user is asking for a sequence, I can make the calls as:\n\n- Call 1: calculate_derivative for the original, without x_value, to get deriv1 string.\n\n- Call 2: calculate_derivative for that string with x_value=4.\n\nBut in my response, I can't use the string from call1; I have to write it as is, so for call2, I need to say calculate_derivative(function= [whatever the output is], but I don't know.\n\nThis is tricky. Perhaps in this system, when I output multiple calls, the system executes them in order and uses the outputs accordingly, but the format doesn't specify that.\n\nLooking back at the instructions: \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\" and \"put it in the format of [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\"\n\nI think I have to assume that the system will handle the sequencing, or perhaps I need to output only the first call, and then in the next turn, based on the response, output the next.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nSo, perhaps in this response, I should output the first function call, and then in the next turn, based on the result, output the next one.\n\nThat makes sense. So, for now, start with the first one.\n\nSo, first, call: calculate_derivative(function='3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7')\n\nThen, after getting that, in the next turn, I can use the result to make the next call.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in this response, I'll only output the first call.\n\nThe user asked for a sequence, so I need to plan for that.\n\nTo be safe, I'll start with the first one.\n\nThe exact request: \"calculate the derivative of the polynomial function '3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7' and then evaluate this derivative at x=4? After that, could you also calculate the derivative of the resulting function and evaluate it at x=2?\"\n\nSo, step 1: calculate derivative.\n\nStep 2: evaluate it at x=4.\n\nStep 3: calculate derivative of that (the first derivative).\n\nStep 4: evaluate that at x=2.\n\nIn my first response, I'll call the first one.\n\nThen, the system will respond with the result, and I can continue.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, my response should be: [calculate_derivative(function='3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7')]\n\nThat way, I get the first derivative as a string, say \"9x^2 - 4x + 5\", and then in the next turn, I can call [calculate_derivative(function='9x^2 - 4x + 5', x_value=4), and so on].\n\nI think that's how it works.\n\nOK, so for now, output that."}

HCF is typically between two numbers, so maybe they mean HCF of the first result and one of the numbers in the pair, but that's unclear. Perhaps they mean HCF of the first result and the HCF of (90, 120), but the phrasing is off.\n\nThe function is math_hcf(number1, number2), which takes exactly two numbers.\n\nThe exact wording: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\"\n\nThis might mean: First, get HCF of (45, 60), let's call it A.

Perhaps they mean HCF of [HCF(36,48)] and each of (72,96), but that would be two calls.\n\nMaybe it's a chain: HCF( HCF(36,48), 72, 96 ), but our function only takes two arguments.\n\nOur function only takes two numbers at a time, so I have to break it down.\n\nTo minimize calls, I need to compute step by step.\n\nLet me break it down as per the user's request.\n\nFirst task: Calculate HCF of (45,60). Let's call this result A.\n\nThen, \"use that result to find the HCF with another pair (90,120)\".

Compute HCF(45,60) = A\n\n2. Compute HCF(90,120) = B\n\n3. Compute HCF(A, B)\n\nAnd separately:\n\n4. Compute HCF(36,48) = C\n\n5. Compute HCF(72,96) = D\n\n6. Compute HCF(C, D)\n\nSo, in total, I need to make several function calls.\n\nSince the system allows multiple function calls in one response, I can list them out.\n\nThe instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

In this setup, when I call a function, I assume the system will execute it and provide the result in the next turn, but the instruction says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nIn this simulation, I need to output all calls that can be made independently first.\n\nThe problem is that some calls depend on the results of previous ones.\n\nFor example, I can call math_hcf(45,60) and math_hcf(90,120) immediately.\n\nThen, once I have those results, I can call math_hcf with those results.\n\nSimilarly for the other pair.\n\nIn my response, I should output the independent calls first.\n\nThe instruction: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nIn practice, for this setup, I need to output the functions that can be called now.\n\nSo, probably: First response: Call the initial HCFs.\n\nThen, in the next turn, after getting results, call the next ones.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params), ...]\"\n\nAnd \"You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nI need to output as many as I can in this response.\n\nSince some depend on others, I should output the ones that don't depend.\n\nPerhaps the system will handle the sequencing.\n\nAnother way: Maybe I can output all, but use the results as variables, but I can't, because I have to specify the parameters now.\n\nIn the format, I have to specify the actual parameters, not variables.\n\nFor example, I can say: [math_hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math_hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math_hcf(number1= result_of_first, number2= result_of_second)] but that's not allowed; I have to use actual values.\n\nI can't do that. So, I need to output only the calls that can be made with the current information.\n\nFirst, output: [math_hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math_hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math_hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math_hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\nThen, in the next turn, after getting those results, say A, B, C, D, then output [math_hcf(number1=A, number2=B), math_hcf(number1=C, number2=D)]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for this response, I'll output the four initial calls.\n\nThe user asked for two chains:\n\nFirst chain: HCF of (45,60) and then with HCF of (90,120), so yes, need HCF(45,60) and HCF(90,120) first.\n\nSecond chain: HCF of (36,48) and then with HCF of (72,96), so need those two.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo, my response should be: [math_hcf(number1=45, number2=60), math_hcf(number1=90, number2=120), math_hcf(number1=36, number2=48), math_hcf(number1=72, number2=96)]\n\nI think that's it for now."}

I don't need to specify it.\n\nFor the second scenario: in a medium with relative permittivity of 5 x 10^-12 F/m. The function parameter is \"medium_permittivity\", and it's described as \"The relative permittivity of the medium\". But in the docstring, it says: \"medium_permittivity (float): The relative permittivity of the medium in which the charges are present. Default is 8.854 x 10^-12 F/m (vacuum permittivity).\"\n\nThere's a potential confusion. The user said \"a medium with a relative permittivity of 5 x 10^-12 F/m\". Relative permittivity is usually a dimensionless quantity, like the dielectric constant, e.g., for vacuum it's 1, and the actual permittivity is \u03b50 = 8.854 x 10^-12 F/m.\n\nBut in the function, it's called \"medium_permittivity\" and described as \"The relative permittivity of the medium\", but the default is given as the absolute permittivity of vacuum.\n\nThis might be an inconsistency. Typically, relative permittivity \u03b5_r is used, and the actual permittivity \u03b5 = \u03b5_r * \u03b50.\n\nLooking back: \"medium_permittivity (float): The relative permittivity of the medium... Default is 8.854 x 10^-12 F/m (vacuum permittivity).\"\n\nIt says \"relative permittivity\" but then defaults to the absolute value. This is confusing. Perhaps the function expects the absolute permittivity, not the relative one.\n\nThe user provided: \"a medium with a relative permittivity of 5 x 10^-12 F/m\". That doesn't make sense because relative permittivity should be dimensionless. 5 x 10^-12 F/m has units, which is like absolute permittivity.\n\nPerhaps the user meant the absolute permittivity is 5 x 10^-12 F/m.\n\nIn physics, relative permittivity is \u03b5_r, and absolute is \u03b5 = \u03b5_r * \u03b50.\n\nBut the user said \"relative permittivity of 5 x 10^-12 F/m\", which includes units, so it's probably a mistake, and they mean absolute permittivity.\n\nFor the function, it says: \"medium_permittivity (float): The relative permittivity of the medium... Default is 8.854 x 10^-12 F/m\"\n\nThis is messy. I think the function is expecting the absolute permittivity, despite saying \"relative\".\n\nTo proceed, I'll assume that \"medium_permittivity\" means the absolute permittivity, as per the default value.\n\nSo, for the first scenario: vacuum, so use default, which is 8.854e-12.\n\nFor the second: user says relative permittivity of 5e-12 F/m, but if it's relative, it should be multiplied by \u03b50, but that doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the user meant absolute permittivity of 5e-12 F/m.\n\nTo match the function, I'll use it as is.\n\nThe function call needs: charge1=5, charge2=10, distance=2, and for the second case, medium_permittivity=5e-12.\n\nThe user needs two calculations, so I should make two function calls.\n\nMy response should only include the function calls in the specified format.\n\nI need to call: electromagnetic_force(5, 10, 2) for the first one, and electromagnetic_force(5, 10, 2, medium_permittivity=5e-12) for the second.\n\nIn the format: [electromagnetic_force(charge1=5, charge2=10, distance=2), electromagnetic_force(charge1=5, charge2=10, distance=2, medium_permittivity=5e-12)]\n\nThat seems right.\n\nThe function parameters are integers for charge and distance, but medium_permittivity is float, which 5e-12 is.\n\nCharge1 and charge2 are specified as integers, and 5 and 10 are integers, good.

It's specified as a string in the function signature, but the docstring says it's a boolean. I need to treat it as per the function: it says detailed='', which might imply it's a string, but the description says boolean.

So, yes, I can set it to True or False.\n\nThe user also asks to \"compare\" them. However, the function doesn't have a built-in comparison feature. It only retrieves info for one cell at a time.

Default is 'bus'.\"\n\nAnd allow_transfer: \"Allows transfer between different transportation if true.\"\n\nSo, for the first call: transportation='bus', allow_transfer=False\n\nFor the second call: transportation='bus', allow_transfer=True\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nI need to output only the function calls in the exact format.\n\nSo, my response should be: [city_distance_find_shortest(start_city=\"New York\", end_city=\"Los Angeles\", transportation=\"bus\", allow_transfer=False), city_distance_find_shortest(start_city=\"New York\", end_city=\"Los Angeles\", transportation=\"bus\", allow_transfer=True)]\n\nThe function's default for transportation is 'bus', so I could omit it in the second call, but to be explicit, I'll include it.\n\nallow_transfer defaults to False, so in the first call, I could omit it, but again, for clarity, I'll specify.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]\"\n\nSo, I'll list them in a list.\n\nFinally, once I output these, I've fulfilled the request, so no more functions needed."}

But the user wants it for sub-periods: first 2 years, then next 3 years, and finally the remaining 5 years.\n\nI need to call this function multiple times to get the interest for each sub-period.\n\nThe function calculates the compound interest, which typically means the total interest earned over the specified time. But for compound interest, it's cumulative. So, if I calculate for the first 2 years, that gives interest up to 2 years. Then for the next 3 years (years 3-5), I might need to use the new principal after 2 years, and so on.\n\nThe function as defined doesn't return the new principal; it just calculates the interest. Looking at the function doc: \"Calculate compound interest for an initial principal amount.\" It probably returns the interest amount, not the future value.\n\nThe standard compound interest formula is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), and interest = A - P.\n\nIf I call it for the first 2 years, I get the interest for those 2 years based on the initial principal.\n\nFor the next 3 years, I need to use the principal as the amount after 2 years, not the original principal.\n\nThe function requires the initial principal for each call, but it doesn't specify if it can handle a different starting point.\n\nThe function description: \"Calculate compound interest for an initial principal amount.\" It seems designed for a single calculation from the start.\n\nTo accurately calculate for sub-periods, I need the future value after the first period to use as the new principal for the next.\n\nThis function doesn't provide a way to get the future value directly; it only calculates interest.\n\nI might need to call it multiple times, but I'd have to chain them by calculating the new principal each time.\n\nIn my response, I can only output function calls.

So, perhaps I need to make multiple calls, but the system might process them sequentially.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\nI might need to output all necessary calls in this response.\n\nIn practice, when I call a function, its output could be used in the next call, but in this setup, I have to specify everything now.\n\nThe format is to list multiple function calls in one response, like [func1(), func2()]\n\nI can output multiple calls.\n\nThe issue is that the second call depends on the result of the first.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. First call: for first 2 years with initial principal.\n\n2. Then, use the result to get new principal, say future value = principal + interest from first call.\n\n3. Second call: for next 3 years with new principal.\n\nI don't know the new principal until the first function is called.\n\nThis is a problem. The system might handle it by executing them in sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that the functions can be called in sequence, and the system will provide the outputs.\n\nThe prompt doesn't specify that. It says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI think I should output the calls as needed.\n\nMaybe the function only needs to be called once per period, but I have to provide the correct principal each time.\n\nSince I can't calculate it, I need to call it for each period separately, but that won't be accurate.\n\nAnother way: perhaps calculate the total for 2 years, then for 5 years (first 5 years), then subtract, but that's complicated.\n\nLet's think differently. The user asked for the compound interest for the first 2 years, then for the next 3 years, and finally for the remaining 5 years.\n\nSo, strictly, I need:\n\n- Interest earned in years 1-2\n\n- Interest earned in years 3-5 (on the growing principal)\n\n- Interest earned in years 6-10 (on the even larger principal)\n\nTo do that accurately, I need to chain the calculations.\n\nSince I can't do the math here, I should just output the calls with the initial principal for each, even if it's not perfect, or point out the issue.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nIn this case, the parameters are there, but the function doesn't support chaining directly.\n\nPerhaps I can output the first call, and then in the next turn, based on the result, output the next.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nI think I can output multiple calls in one response.\n\nLet me try to list them:\n\nFirst: calculate for first 2 years.\n\nSecond: calculate for next 3 years, but I need the new principal.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I have to assume the system will handle it, or perhaps just call it with the initial principal, which is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the function can be called with the appropriate principal, but since I don't have it, I can't.\n\nI need to output the calls as is, and let the system execute them.\n\nBut that won't work.\n\nAnother idea: the user might mean to calculate the interest as if starting from the beginning for each period, but that doesn't make sense for compound interest.\n\nThe question says: \"calculate the compound interest for the first 2 years, then for the next 3 years and finally for the remaining 5 years\"\n\nI think it's implied to be sequential.\n\nPerhaps I can calculate the future value after 2 years, then use that as principal for the next, but I can't do that in the function call output.\n\nIn the response, I can only output the function calls, not logic.\n\nI need to output the first call, and then the system will respond with the result, and in the next turn, I can use that.\n\nThe prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks within the current turn.\"\n\nSo, perhaps for now, output the first call.\n\nBut the user asked for all, so I need to output all three, even if the later ones are incorrect.\n\nThat doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's check the function: it takes principal, so for the second call, I need to specify a principal, which I don't have.\n\nI can't output the second call without the principal.\n\nSo, perhaps I should only output the first call, and then in the next turn, based on the response, output the next.\n\nThe system prompt doesn't specify how multiple turns work, but it says \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled\"\n\nI think for this, I'll output the first function call, and let the system handle the rest.\n\nSo, for now, call for the first 2 years.\n\nThen, after that, in the next interaction, I can call for the next period using the new principal from the previous result.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, my response should be: [calculate_compound_interest(principal=5000, rate=0.025, time=2, n=4)]\n\nAfter that, when the system responds with the result, I can use it to make the next call.\n\nFor example, suppose the first call returns the interest, say $X, then the new principal is 5000 + X, and I can use that for the next call.\n\nSo, I'll start with that."}

For Tesla with '1 month'\n\nMy response should only include the function calls in the specified format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), ...]\n\nI need to output all necessary calls in this response since I should try to complete the task in the current turn.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

No other text.\n\nFinally, once I output these, the system will handle the execution.\n\nThe function description says \"companies (array): List of companies\", so even if it's one company, it should be a list.\n\nAlright, let's list them out:\n\n1. get_stock_prices(companies=['Apple'], duration='1 week')\n\n2. get_stock_prices(companies=['Microsoft'], duration='2 weeks')\n\n3. get_stock_prices(companies=['Amazon'], duration='3 weeks')\n\n4. get_stock_prices(companies=['Tesla'], duration='1 month')\n\nResponse: [get_stock_prices(companies=['Apple'], duration='1 week'), get_stock_prices(companies=['Microsoft'], duration='2 weeks'), get_stock_prices(companies=['Amazon'], duration='3 weeks'), get_stock_prices(companies=['Tesla'], duration='1 month')]\n\nThat seems correct."}

For 2D points, it's the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the differences in x and y coordinates.\n\nThe available function is `math_hypot(x, y, z='')`, which calculates the Euclidean norm. It takes x and y as required parameters, and z as optional.\n\nTo find the total distance, I need to calculate:\n\n1. Distance from (5, 7) to (10, 15).\n\n2. Distance from (10, 15) to (20, 25).\n\nThen, sum those distances.\n\nFor the first distance: From (5, 7) to (10, 15), the differences are \u0394x = 10 - 5 = 5, \u0394y = 15 - 7 = 8. So, I need to call math_hypot with x=5, y=8.\n\nThe function math_hypot(x, y) calculates the hypotenuse for a vector from origin to (x, y), which is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So for two points, I need to pass the differences: x as the difference in x-coordinates, y as the difference in y-coordinates.\n\nYes, so for first leg: x = 10 - 5 = 5, y = 15 - 7 = 8.\n\nFor second leg: x = 20 - 10 = 10, y = 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nI need to make two separate calls to math_hypot, one for each segment, and then somehow add them up. But the instructions say I should only return function calls, and the system will handle the rest. However, I need to fulfill the user's request.\n\nThe user asked for the total distance, so I might need to call the function twice and then perhaps use another function or assume the system will aggregate, but I only have this one function.\n\nThe instructions: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI need to output the necessary function calls. Since I have to calculate two distances and sum them, but I don't have a sum function, I might just call math_hypot twice, and perhaps in a subsequent turn, I can add them.\n\nThe function is only for calculating one hypotenuse at a time. So, I should call it for each segment.\n\nThe response format: I must only return the function calls in the specified format.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to call math_hypot twice in my response.\n\nThe format allows multiple: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nAfter that, the system might process them and give me results for the next turn.\n\nTo be precise, let's think: The user wants the total distance, which is the sum of two Euclidean distances.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Call math_hypot for the first distance.\n\n2. Call math_hypot for the second distance.\n\nThen, presumably, in the next interaction, I can use those results to sum them.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete.\"\n\nSo, in this response, I should output both calls.\n\nFinally, how do I specify the parameters?\n\nFor first call: Distance from (5,7) to (10,15): x = 10 - 5 = 5, y = 15 - 7 = 8\n\nSo, math_hypot(x=5, y=8)\n\nFor second: From (10,15) to (20,25): x=20-10=10, y=25-15=10\n\nSo, math_hypot(x=10, y=10)\n\nMy response should be: [math_hypot(x=5, y=8), math_hypot(x=10, y=10)]\n\nI need to sum them, but I don't have a function for that. Maybe the system will provide the results, and I can call another function next, but since I only have this function, perhaps that's it for now.\n\nThe user asked to calculate the total, so I might need to indicate that.\n\nAccording to the rules, I should only output function calls, and let the system handle it.\n\nI think that's as far as I can go.\n\nOne more thing: The function has z as optional, and we're in 2D, so I don't need z.\n\nAlright, let's format it properly."}
