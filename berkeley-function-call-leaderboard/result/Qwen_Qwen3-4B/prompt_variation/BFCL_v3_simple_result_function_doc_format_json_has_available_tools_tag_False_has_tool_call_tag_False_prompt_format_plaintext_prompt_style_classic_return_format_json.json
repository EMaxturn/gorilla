The parameters needed are height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The height is given as 150 meters. The initial velocity is zero, which is the default value, so maybe I don't need to specify it. But the function requires height as a required parameter. So I should call the function with height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Gravity is 9.81 by default, so unless specified otherwise, it's okay. So the function call should be calculate_final_velocity with height 150 and initial_velocity 0. Let me check the parameters again. The required is only height, so initial_velocity is optional.

Since they want this to happen twice in a row, I need to multiply the probability of getting a six on the first roll by the probability of getting a six on the second roll.

Wait, the function's start_date parameter is a string in MM-DD-YYY format. The user said \"after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 2, 2021? Or does the function accept a range? Wait, the function's description says \"start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So maybe the start_date is the beginning of the range.

So perhaps the user's query is to search from January 1, 2021 onwards. But the function's start_date is a single date. Maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not part of the parameters, so the user's query is to start from January 1, 2021. But the user says \"after\" that date, so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. However, the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so perhaps the user's query is to start from January 1, 2021, and the function will handle it. Alternatively, maybe the function's start_date is the earliest date, and the user's query is to start from January 1, 2021. But the user says \"after\", so maybe the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the function's parameters don't have an end_date, so perhaps the user's query is to start from January 1, 2021. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But the user's instruction is to search for lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021. So the start_date should be January 2, 2021. But the function's start_date is in MM-DD-YYY format. So January 1, 2021 is 01-01-2021. But the user wants after that date, so the start_date would be 01-02-2021. However, maybe the function is designed to take a start date and the end date is not specified, so the user's query is to start from January 1, 2021.

The function provided is hotel_booking. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. There's also preferences, which is an array of optional preferences like pet_friendly, gym, etc.\n\nThe user specified \"pet friendly\", so I should include that in the preferences. The location is Manhattan, New York. Room type is single. Duration is 3 nights. Start date is March 10th, 2023. The function requires the start_date as a string. So I need to format that correctly, probably as 'YYYY-MM-DD' or similar. The user wrote March 10th, 2023, so converting that to '2023-03-10' would be appropriate.\n\nCheck if all required parameters are present. Location (Manhattan, New York), room_type (single), duration (3), start_date (2023-03-10). Preferences include pet_friendly. The other parameters like gym, swimming_pool, etc., are optional and not mentioned, so they can be omitted. The preferences array should include 'pet_friendly' as per the user's request.\n\nSo the function call should have those parameters. Let me structure the JSON accordingly. Make sure the parameters are correctly named and formatted. The preferences array is optional, so if not specified, it defaults to all, but since the user wants pet_friendly, we need to include that. Wait, the description says preferences default to all if not specified. But the user is specifying a particular preference, so we should include it. So the preferences array should be ['pet_friendly'].\n\nWait, the parameters for preferences are an array of strings from the enum. So the user wants pet_friendly, so that's the only one. So the function call should have preferences: ['pet_friendly'].\n\nPutting it all together: location is 'Manhattan, New York', room_type 'single', duration 3, start_date '2023-03-10', preferences ['pet_friendly'].\n\nI think that's all. Let me double-check. The required parameters are all there. The start date is in the correct format. The preferences are correctly specified. Yes, that should work."}
