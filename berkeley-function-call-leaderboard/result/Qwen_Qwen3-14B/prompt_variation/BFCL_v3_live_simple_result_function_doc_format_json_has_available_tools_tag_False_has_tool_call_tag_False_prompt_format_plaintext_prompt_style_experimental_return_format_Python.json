But the function's documentation says to separate with comma with no space. Hmm. The function's parameter description says: \"If there are multiple requests, separate using comma with no space between comma\". So even if the user includes a space, maybe the function expects it without. But the user's instruction is to use the modification verbatim.

Should I modify the request to fit the function's format or keep it as the user wrote?\n\nThe function's note says \"the provided function is in Python 3 syntax\", but that might not affect the parameter format.

But the example in the function uses '123 Main St, Springfield, IL'. So maybe the address should be in English? But the user provided it in Vietnamese. Should I convert it? The function's parameter description says the format is 'Address, City, State', but it doesn't specify the language. However, Uber probably uses English addresses. Hmm, but the user might have given the address in their local language. Maybe the function can handle Vietnamese? Not sure. But the example is in English, so maybe the function expects English. But the user's query is in Vietnamese, so maybe the address is correctly provided as is. Maybe the function can process it regardless. I'll use the address as provided.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which is in the enum options (plus, comfort, black). So that's correct. The time is 10 minutes, which is an integer.

Since the default for movie_date is the current date, I don't need to set it explicitly. The city is Mumbai. No cinema hall, language, or format filters mentioned. So I should call get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date as today. Wait, but the default is already current date, so maybe just city is enough. But the user said \"today\", so maybe it's better to explicitly set movie_date to today's date in India. Wait, the system note says to default to current date in India. So if today's date in India is 2023-10-25, then movie_date would be that. But since the function's default is current date, maybe it's okay to omit it. However, the user specified \"today\", so including it might be better to ensure it's correct. But the function's default is already set to current date, so maybe it's redundant. Let me check the parameters again. The movie_date parameter has a default of None, but the description says default is current date. Wait, the parameters show 'default': None, but the description says default is current date. That might be a discrepancy. But according to the parameters, movie_date is optional with default None, but the description says default is current date. Hmm, perhaps the function internally uses the current date if None. So to be safe, maybe include movie_date as today's date. But how to get today's date in India? The system note says to consider the current date in India. So if today is 2023-10-25, then set movie_date='2023-10-25'. But since the user is asking for today, and the function's default is current date, maybe it's okay to omit it. However, the user might be in a different time zone, so to ensure accuracy, perhaps include the date. But the function's default is supposed to handle that. I think the correct approach is to call get_movies with city='Mumbai' and movie_date set to today's date in India. But since the function's default is current date, maybe just city is sufficient. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says default is current date. That's conflicting. Maybe the function's code uses the current date if movie_date is None. So in the function call, if we don't provide movie_date, it will use today's date. Therefore, the correct call is get_movies(city='Mumbai'). But the user said \"today\", so maybe it's better to explicitly set the date.

That seems like a problem. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the function's parameters. The description says the function retrieves the service ID based on service type and location, but the parameters require service_id as an input. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the function is supposed to take parameters like service_type, province, district, and rating, and return the service_id. But according to the given function, the parameters are service_id, province_id, district_name, and rating. So maybe the function is not designed to search by service type but requires the service_id as input. That would mean the function isn't suitable for the user's request because the user doesn't know the service_id. \n\nBut the user is asking for ironing services, which the example says service_id 2 is ironing. So maybe the user can use service_id=2 as the input. Then, the function would retrieve the service ID based on that service type, province, district, and rating.

For example, maybe the service_id parameter is actually the service type, but the description says service_id is the unique identifier.
