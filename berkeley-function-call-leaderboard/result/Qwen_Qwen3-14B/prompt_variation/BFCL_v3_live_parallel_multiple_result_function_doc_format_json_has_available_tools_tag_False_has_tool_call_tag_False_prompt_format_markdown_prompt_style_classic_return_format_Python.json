The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the new food item. They also mentioned removing anchovies, so I should use the removeIngredients parameter. Anchovies are typically in Caesar salads, so removing them makes sense. The parameters would be foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nFor the drink part: The drink ID is given as 123. The function ChaDri.change_drink needs drink_id and new_preferences. The new preferences include size=\"large\", temperature=\"hot\", sweetness_level=\"regular\", and milk_type=\"almond\". The special_instructions are not mentioned, so they can be omitted or left as default. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.

The user is asking for the latest news reports for two different locations: Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland. Both should be in English, and for Letterkenny, the focus is on technology news.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The get_news_report function seems appropriate here. The parameters required are location, category, and language. The location needs to be in 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country' format. For Paris, France, that's straightforward. For Letterkenny, Ireland, since Ireland is a country, the format would be 'Letterkenny, Ireland'.\n\nThe category for Paris isn't specified, so the default 'General' will be used. For Letterkenny, the category should be 'Technology'. The language for both is English, which is the default 'en'. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls. The first for Paris, France with default category and language. The second for Letterkenny, Ireland with category 'Technology' and language 'en'. \n\nWait, the parameters for get_news_report have 'location' as required. The category has a default of 'General', so if the user doesn't specify, that's okay. But for Letterkenny, the category is specified as technology. So I need to set that. Also, check if the language is set to 'en' for both, which it is. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nget_news_report(location=\"Paris, France\", category=\"General\", language=\"en\")\nget_news_report(location=\"Letterkenny, Ireland\", category=\"Technology\", language=\"en\")\n\nI think that's correct.

Yes, that should work."}

The user wants me to perform several steps on a Git repository. First, I need to clone the repo from the given URL. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url, and optionally destination, recursive, and depth. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default, which is the current directory.\n\nNext, after cloning, I need to analyze the repo contents to determine the primary programming language. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. The repo is cloned into the current directory, so the directory name would be 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming the default destination). Once I get the analysis, I can proceed to create or update the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name, which would be the same 'nodejs-welcome' directory. \n\nThen, I have to create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name, and optionally deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I'll use the defaults. The deployment name might default to the directory name, image name is 'latest', replicas 1, port 80, and service type ClusterIP.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function can handle adding, committing, and pushing. The parameters needed are directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, and force_push. The user didn't specify a commit message, so I'll use the default 'Update changes', branch 'main', and force_push false.\n\nWait, but the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is part of the push function. So the push function will automatically git add all changes. So after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, I need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name 'nodejs-welcome', commit message as default, etc.\n\nI need to make sure the order is correct: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAML, then push. The analyze step might be necessary to determine if the Dockerfile needs to be created or updated. But the user's step 2.1 says to create/update based on analysis. However, the functions available don't have a way to check if the Dockerfile exists, so maybe the create_a_docker_file function will overwrite or create it. The user might just want to create it regardless. So proceed with creating the Dockerfile in the repo directory.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo with repo_url=git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n2. analyse_repo_contents with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n3. create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n5. push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'\n\nWait, but the push function requires the directory name. Also, after cloning, the directory is 'nodejs-welcome', so all steps should use that directory. The user didn't specify any parameters for the Kubernetes YAML, so use defaults. The commit message is default, branch is main. So the push function will add all changes, commit, and push.\n\nI think that's the sequence. Let me check if all parameters are provided. For the clone, repo_url is given. For the analysis, directory_name is 'nodejs-welcome'. For Dockerfile, same. For Kubernetes, same. For push, same directory. Yes. So the function calls should be in that order."}

The available tool 'get_relevant_classes' can search for classes based on a keyword. The parameters include 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'.

The 'get_signature' function requires 'class_name', 'method_name', and 'include_private'. Since the user is overriding these methods, they probably need the public signatures. So, two separate calls to get_signature: one for each method, with class_name='AbstractCellHandler' and include_private=False. \n\nWait, but the user is working in Java. The tools provided don't specify language, but the functions like get_signature might be language-agnostic. However, the parameters for get_signature don't mention language, so assuming it's handled by the function. Also, the 'get_imports' function isn't needed here since the user isn't asking about missing imports but rather method signatures and class searches.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided. For get_relevant_classes, 'search_string' is required. For get_signature, both 'class_name' and 'method_name' are required. The user provided the class name 'AbstractCellHandler' and method names 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. So, three function calls in total: one for the class search and two for the method signatures."}

The user is asking two things: the area of a square with a side of 5 cm and the weather in Queenstown, Singapore.\n\nFirst, for the area of the square. The function get_area_of_square is available. The parameter required is 'size', which is a float. The user provided 5 cm, so the size is 5.0. That's straightforward. I can call get_area_of_square with size=5.0.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather needs a location in the format 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. Queenstown is a town in Singapore. So the location parameter should be 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The unit isn't specified, so it'll default to Fahrenheit. I need to call get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore'.\n\nWait, but Singapore is a country, so maybe the location is just 'Queenstown, Singapore'. The function's examples include 'Paris, France' and 'New York, NY', so 'Queenstown, Singapore' should be correct. I don't see any issues there.\n\nSo both functions are needed here. The user's question has two parts, each requiring a separate function call. I need to make sure both are included in the response."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the Events tools, there's Events_3_FindEvents. It requires event_type, city, and optionally date. The event_type can be Music or Theater. The city should be Los Angeles, and the date is 2023-03-10. The parameters fit. So I need to call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type as \"Music\" and \"Theater\" separately? Wait, but the function's parameters have event_type as a single string. Wait, the enum for event_type is ['Music', 'Theater'], so maybe the user wants both types. But the function can only take one event_type at a time. Hmm, but the user said \"any music concerts or theater plays\", so maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each type. Or maybe the function allows multiple types? Wait, looking at the parameters, the event_type is a single string, not a list. So to cover both, I need two separate calls. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle both if I use a different approach, but according to the parameters, it's a single enum value. So I'll have to make two separate function calls: one for Music and one for Theater, both with city as \"Los Angeles, CA\" and date \"2023-03-10\". Wait, the city parameter can be \"Los Angeles\" or \"Los Angeles, CA\". The description says it can be formatted as 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City'. So using \"Los Angeles\" should be okay. But to be precise, maybe \"Los Angeles, CA\" is better. Also, the date parameter is optional, defaulting to 'any', but the user specified March 10th, so set date to '2023-03-10'. So the two function calls would be Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Music', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10') and Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='Theater', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10'). That should cover both types of events the user is interested in."}

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The user specified Sunnyvale, CA, so city is set. They didn't mention unisex preference, so the default 'dontcare' should be used.\n\nThen, for booking, the Services_1_BookAppointment function is required.

The first function call is to find the provider in Sunnyvale, and the second is to book the appointment. No missing parameters here. The weather function isn't needed here.
