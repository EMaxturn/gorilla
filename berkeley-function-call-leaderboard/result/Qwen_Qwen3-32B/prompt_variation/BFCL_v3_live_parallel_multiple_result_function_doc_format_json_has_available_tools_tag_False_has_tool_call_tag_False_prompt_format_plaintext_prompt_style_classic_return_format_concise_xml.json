The parameters required are foodItem, and optionally newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients mentioned, so that can be left as default. Special instructions aren't mentioned either.\n\nThen for the drink, they mentioned order ID 123. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences is a dict with size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type, etc. The user wants a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. So size is 'large', temperature is 'hot', sweetness_level 'regular', milk_type 'almond'. The drink_id is '123'. \n\nI need to make sure all parameters are correctly formatted. For ChaFod, the removeIngredients is a string, so \"anchovies\". For the drink, the new_preferences should be a dictionary with those key-value pairs.

There's get_news_report which takes location, category, and language. The parameters are required for location, and category and language have defaults. The location needs to be in the format 'City, Country' if the state isn't available. Since Paris is in France and Letterkenny is in Ireland, both fit that format.\n\nFor Paris, the user wants it in English. The default language is 'en', so that's covered. The category isn't specified for Paris, so it will default to 'General'. But the user didn't mention a category for Paris, so that's okay.\n\nFor Letterkenny, the user wants technology news. So the category should be 'Technology' and language 'en' again. The function allows specifying the category, so I need to set that parameter. \n\nSo I need to make two separate calls to get_news_report. The first one for Paris, France with default parameters except language (though language is already 'en' by default). The second one for Letterkenny, Ireland with category 'Technology' and language 'en'.\n\nWait, the user said \"again in English\" for Letterkenny, so maybe they just want to confirm the language is English again.

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the clone_repo function. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The function requires repo_url, and I can set the destination to a directory, maybe 'nodejs-welcome' to keep it organized. I'll use that function first.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The analyse_repo_contents function takes the directory name. Once I get the analysis, I can proceed to create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory name, which should be the same as the cloned repo's directory. \n\nThen, create the Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory name. I'll need to specify parameters like deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. Since the user didn't provide specifics, I'll use defaults where possible. For example, the deployment name could be based on the directory name, image name might be 'nodejs-welcome', and service type as LoadBalancer.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to push them back to the repo. The push_git_changes_to_github function will handle that. It requires the directory name, commit message, branch name, and force push flag. The default branch is 'main', so I'll use that unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the user mentioned adding all changed files to git. The push function's description says it automatically adds all changes, so I don't need a separate step for git add. Just commit and push. \n\nI should check if all parameters are provided. The repo URL is given, destination is set, directory names are consistent. For the Kubernetes YAML, since some parameters are optional, using defaults should be okay. The user might expect the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files to be created in the correct directory. \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the function calls in order."}

They're working on a Java project and encountering a compilation error related to the 'StringNumberHandler' class extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The specific issue is that 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to True. The search string is 'CellResult', and since they didn't mention case sensitivity, I'll default to False.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to check their overrides. The 'get_signature' function is the right choice here. For each method, I'll call the function with 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and the respective 'method_name'. The 'include_private' parameter is optional and defaults to False, which should be fine unless the methods are private, but that's unlikely for methods meant to be overridden.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided. For 'get_relevant_classes', 'search_string' is required, which is given. For 'get_signature', both 'class_name' and 'method_name' are required. I have those values from the user's question. \n\nI should also check if the functions are applicable. The 'get_relevant_classes' is for searching the repository, which aligns with the user's request. The 'get_signature' function retrieves method signatures, which will help verify the correct overriding. \n\nNo parameters are missing, so the function calls should be valid. The user is working in Java, but the functions don't specify a language, so assuming they're language-agnostic or the system handles Java. Since the functions are provided as per the list, proceed with the calls."}

The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires a 'size' parameter. The user mentioned 5 cm. The function expects a float, so I'll use 5.0 as the value. The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention handling units, so I just pass the numerical value. That should calculate 5 squared, which is 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The get_current_weather function needs a 'location' parameter. Queenstown is a place in Singapore, so the location should be \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function allows formats like \"City, Country\", so this fits. The unit parameter is optional, defaulting to Fahrenheit, but since the user didn't specify, I'll omit it. However, in Singapore, Celsius is more commonly used, but the default is Fahrenheit. Maybe the user expects Celsius, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with the default unless told otherwise.\n\nWait, the user might prefer Celsius. But the function's default is Fahrenheit. Should I include unit='celsius'? The user didn't specify, so maybe it's better to use the default. But sometimes, in such cases, it's safer to assume the local unit. Singapore uses Celsius, so perhaps I should set unit='celsius'. However, the user hasn't specified, so according to the function's parameters, the default is Fahrenheit. Hmm. The function's note says the default is Fahrenheit, so unless the user asks, I should use that. But maybe the user expects the local standard. This is a bit ambiguous. However, since the function's default is Fahrenheit, and the user didn't specify, I'll proceed with the default.
