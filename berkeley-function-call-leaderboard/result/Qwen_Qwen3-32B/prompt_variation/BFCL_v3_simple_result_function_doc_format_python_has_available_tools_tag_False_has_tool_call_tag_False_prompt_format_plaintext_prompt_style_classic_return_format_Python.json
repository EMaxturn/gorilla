I remember there's a function called calculate_final_velocity that can help here.\n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters required by the function. The function needs height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The user provided the height as 150 meters and mentioned the initial velocity is zero. The gravity parameter has a default value of 9.81 m/s\u00b2, so if it's not provided, it will use that. Since the user didn't specify a different gravity, like on the moon or something, I can assume Earth's gravity here.\n\nSo, the parameters would be height=150 and initial_velocity=0. Gravity can be omitted because it's optional and the default is correct. Therefore, the function call should be calculate_final_velocity with those values. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other parameters or requirements. Nope, looks good. The user didn't mention air resistance, and the function ignores it by default. All set."}

The example might have conditions like [('column', 'operator', value)].

For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance.

The parameters are desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional, default 6). The user wants desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides is 6, which is the default. So I can call the function with desired_number=6 and number_of_rolls=2. The die_sides isn't specified, so it will use 6 by default. That should calculate (1/6)^2, which is 1/36.

The investment_amount is an integer (5000), annual_return is a float (7% would be 0.07), and years is an integer (5). All the necessary parameters are present and correctly formatted.\n\nThe function should calculate the profit based on these inputs. Since the user is asking for the total expected profit, this function seems appropriate.

The status is 'ongoing', which is the default, so maybe I don't need to specify it. \n\nWait, the user said \"filed after January 1, 2021\". Does the start_date parameter handle that? The function's description says start_date is the start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed. So using start_date=01-01-2021 should cover lawsuits filed on or after that date.
