It takes:\n\n  - foodItem (str): The name of the food item to be modified.\n\n  - newIngredients (str, optional): Comma-separated list of new ingredients.\n\n  - removeIngredients (str, optional): Comma-separated list of ingredients to remove.\n\n  - specialInstructions (str, optional): Any special instructions.\n\nFor the food: The food item is \"Caesar salad\", and they want to remove anchovies. So, I can use ChaFod with foodItem='Caesar salad' and removeIngredients='anchovies'.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nNext, for the drink: They want to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nLooking at the functions:\n\n- ChaDri.change_drink: This is for modifying a drink order. It takes:\n\n  - drink_id (str): The unique identifier of the drink to be changed.\n\n  - new_preferences (dict): The updated preferences for the drink.\n\nThe user mentioned \"order 123\", which I assume is the drink_id. So, drink_id='123'.\n\nNew preferences: large, hot coffee, regular sweetness, almond milk.\n\nI need to format this as a dictionary. So, something like {'size': 'large', 'type': 'hot coffee', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk': 'almond milk'}.\n\nThe function doesn't specify the exact keys for the dictionary, so I'll assume based on common sense. I should provide a dictionary with the relevant preferences.\n\nI need to make function calls for both.\n\nThe response format requires me to only output the <TOOLCALL> section with the function calls in the specified format.\n\nSo, I should call:\n\n1. ChaFod for the food.\n\n2. ChaDri.change_drink for the drink.\n\nThe function name is listed as \"ChaDri.change_drink\", which might be a module or class method. In the response format, it says to use \"func_name1(params)\", so I'll use it as is: ChaDri.change_drink.\n\nIn the instructions: \"func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)\", and in the list, it's \"# Function: ChaDri.change_drink\", so I should probably call it as ChaDri.change_drink.\n\nTo match the format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can include multiple functions in one TOOLCALL block, separated by commas.\n\nFinally, once I make these calls, I think that's all for this turn, as I've addressed both parts of the request.\n\nDo I have all required parameters?\n\nFor ChaFod:\n\n- foodItem: 'Caesar salad'\n\n- removeIngredients: 'anchovies'\n\nOther params are optional, so that's fine.\n\nFor ChaDri.change_drink:\n\n- drink_id: '123'\n\n- new_preferences: {'size': 'large', 'type': 'hot coffee', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk': 'almond milk'}\n\nI need to format this in the function call.\n\nIn the response, it should be like: ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id='123', new_preferences={'size': 'large', 'type': 'hot coffee', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk': 'almond milk'})\n\nYes.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[ChaFod(foodItem='Caesar salad', removeIngredients='anchovies'), ChaDri.change_drink(drink_id='123', new_preferences={'size': 'large', 'type': 'hot coffee', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk': 'almond milk'})]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct."}

It takes:\n\n   - skill (str): The skill for which to find qualified interviewers.\n\n   - experience_level (str, default='Mid-Level')\n\n   - availability (bool, default=True)\n\n   This seems relevant because the user is asking for interviewers based on skills.\n\n2. **review_of_interviewer**: This is for getting reviews of a specific interviewer, not for listing them.

It handles adding, committing, and pushing. It takes directory_name, commit_message, etc.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says it will automatically git add all changes, so that covers step 3.\n\nI need to sequence these function calls because they depend on each other.\n\nFirst, I have to clone the repo before I can analyze it or create files in it.\n\nSo, the order should be:\n\n1.

So, if I don't specify, it clones to the current dir. But to be precise, I should use the same directory for subsequent calls.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so when cloned, the directory might be named 'nodejs-welcome' or something similar. I need to assume it's cloned to a directory named after the repo.\n\nIn clone_repo, destination defaults to '.', but if I don't specify, it might create a subdirectory. To keep it simple, I'll use the default and assume subsequent functions use the same path.\n\nFor analyse_repo_contents, it takes directory_name, which is \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nThat might be confusing. Probably, it's the path to the repo directory.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI'll assume that after cloning to '.', the directory is the current one, so I can use '.' or the repo name.\n\nTo be safe, let's say the cloned directory is 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe function descriptions don't specify exactly, so I'll use a reasonable name.\n\nIn clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it's '.', but for subfunctions, I need to specify the directory.\n\nPerhaps I should specify destination in clone_repo as 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThe URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so it will likely create a folder named 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nSo, I'll use that.\n\nFirst function: clone_repo with repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', and maybe destination='nodejs-welcome' to be explicit, but it's default to '.', so perhaps let it be.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll set destination to 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, for other functions, use directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has more params like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so I'll use defaults where possible.\n\nIt says: deployment_name: use Defaults if not provided. Similarly for others.\n\nSo, I can just provide directory_name.\n\nSame for push_git_changes_to_github, use defaults for commit_message, etc.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', destination='nodejs-welcome')\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // using defaults for others\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update with Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML')  // I can suggest a message\n\nThe user said \"commit / push to repo\", so I'll use a default message like 'Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes files'.\n\nIn one response, I need to output all these in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\"\n\nSo, I can list them inside the brackets, separated by commas.\n\nFinally, once I output this, the system will execute them in order, I assume.\n\nI think that's it."}

The user said \"5 cm\", so I can use 5.0 as the size.\n\nFor the second part: Getting the weather.\n\n- The function get_current_weather requires a 'location' string. The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\". I need to format this properly. Based on the function description, it should be like 'City, Country', so \"Queenstown, Singapore\" seems appropriate.\n\nI can handle both parts with the available functions.\n\nNow, I need to make function calls. The instructions say to put them in the <TOOLCALL> section, in the exact format specified.\n\nFormat: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI should call both functions in one response since the user asked for both in the same question.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I can call both functions in this turn.\n\nFirst, call get_area_of_square with size=5.0 (since it's a float).\n\nSecond, call get_current_weather with location='Queenstown, Singapore'. The default unit is 'fahrenheit', and the user didn't specify, so I'll leave it as default.\n\nResponse should only contain the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[get_area_of_square(size=5.0), get_current_weather(location='Queenstown, Singapore')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nOne potential issue: The user said \"Queenstown Singapore\", and I assumed it's \"Queenstown, Singapore\". That should be fine based on the function's example.\n\nFor the square, size is 5 cm, but the function doesn't care about units; it just takes a float. So, no problem."}

That sounds perfect.\n\n- Events_3_BuyEventTickets: For buying tickets, but the user is just asking to find events, not buy them.\n\n- Hotels_2_BookHouse: For booking houses, not relevant.\n\n- Hotels_2_SearchHouse: For searching houses, not relevant.\n\nSo, Events_3_FindEvents is the right function to use.\n\nNow, let's check the arguments for Events_3_FindEvents:\n\n- event_type (str): The category of the cultural event. The user mentioned \"music concerts or theater plays\", so I could use something like \"concerts\" or \"plays\". But it might need to be specific. The description says \"such as concerts and plays\", so I can specify one, but the function might allow for a general type. I'll assume I need to choose one; perhaps \"concerts\" as an example.\n\nThe user said \"music concerts or theater plays\", so ideally, I might want to search for both, but the function takes a single event_type. I should probably make a call for one and see, but the instructions say to complete the task in the current turn as best as possible.\n\n- city (str): The name of the city. User said \"Los Angeles\", and it should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)', so that would be 'Los Angeles, CA'.\n\n- date (str, default='any'): The date of the event, formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. User specified \"March 10th\" and \"this year is 2023\", so that's '2023-03-10'.\n\nI have all the necessary parameters:\n\n- event_type: I need to decide. The user said \"music concerts or theater plays\". I could call the function twice, once for each, but the instructions say to make one or more function calls in the response.\n\nThe function is designed for one event_type per call, so to cover both, I might need two calls.\n\nHowever, the response format is to put all function calls in one <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe instructions: \"you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\"\n\nSo, I can include multiple functions in one <TOOLCALL>.\n\nTo be thorough, I should call Events_3_FindEvents for \"concerts\" and for \"plays\" or \"theater\".\n\nWhat exactly to use for event_type? The function description says \"The category of the cultural event\", and examples aren't specified, but based on the human's query, \"music concerts\" could be \"concerts\", and \"theater plays\" could be \"plays\".\n\nI'll go with that.\n\nCity: 'Los Angeles, CA'\n\nDate: '2023-03-10'\n\nSo, I need to make at least one call, probably two.\n\nThe user said \"any music concerts or theater plays\", so one call might suffice if I use a general term, but to match exactly, I'll do two.\n\nFinally, format the response: Only the <TOOLCALL> section with the function calls.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='concerts', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10'), Events_3_FindEvents(event_type='plays', city='Los Angeles, CA', date='2023-03-10')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems appropriate."}
