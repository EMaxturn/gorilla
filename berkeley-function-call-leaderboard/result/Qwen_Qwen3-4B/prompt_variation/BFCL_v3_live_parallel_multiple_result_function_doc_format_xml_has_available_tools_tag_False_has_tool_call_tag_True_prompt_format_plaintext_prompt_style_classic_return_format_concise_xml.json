They want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies and update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, looking at the functions available. There's ChaFod for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified Caesar salad without anchovies. So foodItem is \"Caesar salad\". The removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of new ingredients, so maybe newIngredients is optional. Special instructions might be anything else, but the user didn't specify any, so maybe leave that out.\n\nThen for the drink, the function is ChaDri.change_drink. The parameters are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink ID is 123. The new preferences are large hot coffee, regular sweetness, and almond milk. So new_preferences should be a dictionary with keys like \"size\": \"large\", \"temperature\": \"hot\", \"type\": \"coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond\". Need to make sure that's structured correctly as a dict.\n\nCheck if all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, which is provided. For ChaDri.change_drink, drink_id and new_preferences are both required. The user provided the drink ID and the details. So both function calls should be valid. No missing parameters here. So I'll generate the two tool calls accordingly."}

They want the latest news reports for two different locations: Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland. Both times, they specified English and the technology category for the second one. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The get_news_report function is the one to use here. The parameters required are location, category, and language. The location needs to be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Paris, France, that's straightforward as it's a city and country. Letterkenny, Ireland would be 'Letterkenny, Ireland' since Ireland is a country.\n\nThe user mentioned \"technology news again in English\" for the second location. So for Paris, the category isn't specified, but the second one is technology. Wait, the first part says \"latest news report for Paris, France, in English\" \u2013 so maybe the first call doesn't have a category, and the second one does. But the user says \"again in English\" for the second, so maybe both are in English. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user says: \"latest news report for Paris, France, in English and also for Letterkenny, Ireland, focusing on technology news again in English\". So the first is general news in English, the second is technology news in English. So for Paris, category is not specified, but for Letterkenny, category is Technology. Both have language as English.\n\nSo I need to make two separate function calls. First for Paris, France, location is Paris, France, category is not needed, language is English. Second for Letterkenny, Ireland, location is Letterkenny, Ireland, category is Technology, language is English.\n\nWait, the function parameters for get_news_report: location is required, category is optional, language is optional. So for the first call, parameters are location: Paris, France, language: en. For the second, location: Letterkenny, Ireland, category: Technology, language: en.\n\nI need to make sure the location formats are correct. Paris, France is correct as City, Country. Letterkenny, Ireland is also correct. The category for the second is Technology. The language is English, which is 'en' as per the ISO code.\n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. get_news_report with location=\"Paris, France\", language=\"en\"\n2. get_news_report with location=\"Letterkenny, Ireland\", category=\"Technology\", language=\"en\"\n\nI need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The user didn't specify a category for Paris, so it's optional. The first call doesn't need a category. The second one does. Also, the language is specified as English for both, which is 'en'.\n\nYes, that should cover both requests. The user might be looking for news in English, so the language parameter is set to 'en' for both. The first is general news, the second is technology. So the function calls are correct."}

First, they want to clone a Git repository. The URL provided is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url and an optional destination. Since the user didn't specify a destination, I'll use the default, which is the current working directory.\n\nNext, after cloning, they need to analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function takes a directory_name. The repo is cloned into the current directory, so the directory name here would be \"nodejs-welcome\". This will determine the predominant programming language, which I assume will be used for creating the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\nFor step 2.1, creating a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs a directory_name. The user mentioned creating it based on the analysis, so maybe the directory is the same as the repo's directory. But the function's description says it's within the specified directory. Wait, the function's param is the directory where the Dockerfile is created. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, perhaps the directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\". But the function's example says it's a path relative to the root. So maybe the directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\nThen, step 2.2 is creating Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires the directory_name, which is the same as the repo's directory. The parameters for this function include deployment_name, image_name, replicas, port, and service_type. The user didn't specify these, so I need to check if they have defaults. The description says to use defaults if not provided. So I can call the function without specifying those parameters, relying on defaults.\n\nAfter creating the files, step 3 is to add all changed files to Git. But the functions available don't include a 'add changes' function. The push_git_changes_to_github function does a git add and push, but the user's step 3 says \"add all changed files to git changes\". However, the available functions might not have an 'add' command. Wait, the push_git_changes_to_github function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So maybe that's the function to use here. But the user's step 3 is to add changes, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the push function does both add and push. But the user's step 3 is separate. Hmm, maybe the user wants to add changes first, then commit and push. But the available functions don't have an 'add' function. The push function does add, but maybe the user wants to do it in two steps. However, the functions provided don't have an 'add' function. So perhaps the user's step 3 is actually covered by the push function, but the user might have intended to add changes first. But since the functions don't have an 'add' command, maybe the push function is the only way. Alternatively, maybe the user's step 3 is just part of the push process. So perhaps the correct approach is to call push_git_changes_to_github after creating the files.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\", which is equivalent to git add. Then step 4 is commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a commit function. The push function does a git add and push, but the user might need to commit first. But the functions provided don't have a commit function. So maybe the user's step 4 is to push, which includes adding and committing. But the user's step 3 is to add, and step 4 is to commit and push. However, the available functions don't have a commit function. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the push_git_changes_to_github function, which does git add and push. But the user's step 3 is to add, which is part of the push function. So maybe the user's steps are combined into the push function.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Clone the repo using clone_repo with the given URL.\n2. Analyze the repo contents using analyse_repo_contents with the directory name.\n3. Create Dockerfile using create_a_docker_file with the directory name.\n4. Create Kubernetes YAMLs using create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the directory name.\n5. Push changes using push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name and a commit message.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, which is part of the push function. So the functions called would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nNow, checking the parameters for each function.\n\nFor clone_repo, the repo_url is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git, and destination is not specified, so default to current directory.\n\nanalyse_repo_contents requires directory_name, which is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\ncreate_a_docker_file requires directory_name, which is \"nodejs-welcome\".\n\ncreate_kubernetes_yaml_file requires directory_name, which is \"nodejs-welcome\". The other parameters have defaults, so they can be omitted.\n\npush_git_changes_to_github requires directory_name, which is \"nodejs-welcome\". The commit_message is not specified, so maybe use a default, but the function's parameter is optional. The user didn't specify a message, so perhaps leave it out. However, the function's description says it will automatically git add all changes. So the commit message is optional. The user might need to provide one, but since they didn't, maybe the function can handle it without.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo with repo_url and destination (optional).\n\nThen analyse_repo_contents with directory_name.\n\nThen create_a_docker_file with directory_name.\n\nThen create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name.\n\nThen push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add changes, which is part of the push function. So the push function is called after creating the files.\n\nSo the correct sequence is as above."}

They're getting a compilation error in their Java project. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They mentioned that their class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', etc. But the error is related to 'CellResult', so I need to figure out what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. \n\nLet me check the available functions. The 'get_relevant_classes' function can search for classes matching a search string, which in this case is 'CellResult', and include subdirectories. That's the first part of the query. So I should call get_relevant_classes with search_string=\"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories=True.\n\nNext, the user needs the method signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve the signature of a method in a class. But wait, the function requires the class name, method name, and optionally include_private. Since the user is overriding these methods, they probably need the public ones. So I should call get_signature for each method. \n\nFirst, for 'setCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. Then for 'getCellValue' in the same class. Each call would need the class name as \"AbstractCellHandler\", the method name, and maybe include_private set to false unless the methods are private, but the user is overriding them, so likely public. \n\nBut wait, the user's error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' is a class that's part of the repository, and the user's code is trying to use a method that doesn't exist. But the user's main request is to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' and get the method signatures. So the first step is to find classes related to 'CellResult', then get the method signatures for the methods in AbstractCellHandler.\n\nSo the functions to call are:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string=\"CellResult\" and include_subdirectories=True.\n2. get_signature for 'setCellValue' in AbstractCellHandler.\n3. get_signature for 'getCellValue' in AbstractCellHandler.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. For get_relevant_classes, the parameters are search_string, case_sensitive (default false), include_subdirectories (default false). The user wants to include subdirectories, so set include_subdirectories to True.\n\nFor each get_signature call, the parameters are class_name, method_name, and include_private (optional, default false). Since the user is overriding public methods, include_private is probably not needed, but maybe set to false to avoid private methods unless necessary.\n\nSo the tool calls would be:\n\nFirst, get_relevant_classes with the search string and include subdirectories.\n\nThen two get_signature calls for the two methods."}

They want two things: the area of a square with a side of 5 cm and the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. \n\nFirst, for the area of the square. The function provided is get_area_of_square, which requires the size of the side. The user gave 5 cm, so I need to call that function with size=5. The unit here is cm, but the function's parameter is a float, so just passing 5 as a number should work. The unit isn't part of the parameter, so I can ignore it here.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user mentioned Singapore. That might be a typo, but I should check the function. The get_current_weather function needs a location in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. The user said Queenstown Singapore, which is a bit confusing. Maybe they meant Queenstown, New Zealand, but the function's parameters require a valid location. Alternatively, maybe they meant Singapore's weather. But the question says Queenstown Singapore, so I need to use that as the location. However, Queenstown is in New Zealand, so perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, the function will handle the location as given. So I'll call get_current_weather with location=\"Queenstown, Singapore\" and maybe the unit is not specified, so it can default to a standard unit like Celsius or Fahrenheit. The function's unit parameter is optional, so I can omit it.\n\nWait, but the user might have intended Queenstown, New Zealand, but wrote Singapore by mistake. However, the function's parameters require the location to be in the format provided. So I should proceed with the given location as \"Queenstown, Singapore\". The function will handle it, even if it's incorrect. So two function calls: one for the area and one for the weather."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the functions, Events_3_FindEvents seems relevant. It requires event_type, city, and optional date. The event_type can be \"music concert\" or \"theater play\". The city is Los Angeles, and the date is 2023-03-10. \n\nWait, the parameters for Events_3_FindEvents: event_type is required, city is required, and date is optional. So I need to specify the event_type as either music or theater, but the user is asking for both. Hmm, maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each event type. Or maybe the function can handle a list. But the function's parameters don't mention a list, so perhaps two separate calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be a broader category. But the user specified \"music concerts or theater plays\", so perhaps I should split into two separate function calls. However, the function might allow a single event_type parameter. Wait, the function's event_type is a string, so maybe I can set it to \"music concert\" and \"theater play\" in separate calls. \n\nSo first, call Events_3_FindEvents with event_type=\"music concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\". Then another call with event_type=\"theater play\", same city and date. \n\nBut the user might not need to split them. Maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the function definition, the parameters are individual. So I think two separate function calls are needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" or \"play\", but the user specified \"music concerts or theater plays\". So perhaps the function can handle \"concert\" and \"play\" as event types. But the user's query is about both, so two separate calls. \n\nSo the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents twice, once for each event type. But the user might not have specified the exact types. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a single event_type parameter, but the user is asking for both. So maybe the function can be called once with event_type as \"concert\" and another with \"play\". \n\nBut the function's event_type is a string, so perhaps the user's query can be handled by two separate function calls. Therefore, I need to make two tool calls here. \n\nWait, the user's question is to find any music concerts or theater plays. So the event_type could be \"concert\" and \"play\". But the function's parameters require a single event_type. So maybe the user needs to make two separate calls. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be two function calls: one for \"music concert\" and one for \"theater play\". But the function's event_type is a string, so each call would have a different event_type. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the event_type can be \"concert\" and \"play\" as separate parameters. But the function's parameters don't allow multiple values. So the correct approach is to call the function twice with different event types. \n\nSo the first function call is Events_3_FindEvents with event_type=\"music concert\", city=\"Los Angeles, CA\", date=\"2023-03-10\". The second call is Events_3_FindEvents with event_type=\"theater play\", same city and date. \n\nBut the user might not have specified the exact event types. However, the function's event_type is a string, so that's the way to go. \n\nTherefore, the tool calls would be two instances of Events_3_FindEvents with the respective event types."}

The parameters needed are city and is_unisex. The city is given as Sunnyvale, CA, which fits the required format. The is_unisex parameter is optional, and since the user didn't specify, I can leave it out or set it to dontcare.

The function Services_1_BookAppointment requires stylist_name, appointment_time, and appointment_date. The user specified 'Elegant Styles' as the salon, so that's the stylist_name. The time is 15:00, which is in 24-hour format, and the date is 2023-05-10.
