Wait, the function's start_date parameter is for the start of the date range. The user says \"filed after January 1, 2021\", so the start_date should be January 1, 2021, but since it's after, maybe the function expects the start of the range. Wait, the description says \"start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed in the format of MM-DD-YYY.\" So if the user wants lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be January 1, 2021, and maybe the end date is not specified. But the function only takes start_date, not end_date. Hmm, but the function's parameters only have start_date. So perhaps the function is designed to take a start date, and the end date is not part of the parameters. Wait, the function's parameters only have start_date, so maybe the user's query is to search from that date onwards. So the start_date would be January 1, 2021, and the function would return lawsuits filed on or after that date. But the user said \"after January 1, 2021\", which would be strictly after. But since the function's start_date is inclusive, maybe the user's query is intended to be start_date as January 1, 2021, and the function would include that date. However, the user might want to exclude January 1, 2021. But since the function doesn't have an end_date parameter, perhaps the user's query is best represented by setting start_date to January 1, 2021. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to start from January 2, 2021. But the exact date format is MM-DD-YYY. So January 1, 2021 would be 01-01-2021. So the start_date parameter would be '01-01-2021'. The location is California. The status is ongoing, which is the default, but since the user specified it, maybe include it.\n\nSo the function call would be lawsuit_search(company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California', status='ongoing'). But wait, the required parameters are company, start_date, location. Status is optional. But the user specified 'ongoing', so including it is better. So the parameters are all there.

But the preferences parameter defaults to all if not specified, but since the user only wants pet-friendly, I should include that specifically.\n\nWait, the preferences are an array of the enum values. So I need to set preferences to ['pet_friendly'].\n\nCheck required parameters: location, room_type, duration, start_date are all provided. So the function call should include those and the preferences.\n\nSo the function call would be hotel_booking with location='Manhattan, New York', room_type='single', duration=3, start_date='2023-03-10', preferences=['pet_friendly'].\n\nI need to make sure the date is in the correct format. The start_date is given as March 10th, 2023, which should be '2023-03-10' as a string.\n\nYes, that should cover all the requirements."}
