The data_loading function can do that. The parameters are file_path and delimiter. The file is 'dataset.csv', so file_path is 'dataset.csv'. The delimiter is optional, defaulting to comma, which should be fine here.\n\nOnce the data is loaded, I need to extract the 'sales' and 'future_sales' columns. But wait, the parameters for linear_regression_fit require x and y as arrays. So after loading, I should assign x = data['sales'] and y = data['future_sales'].\n\nThen, call linear_regression_fit with those x and y, and set return_residuals to True. The function's parameters include return_residuals as an optional boolean, defaulting to false. The user wants residuals, so that flag must be set to true.\n\nWait, but the data_loading function's output is a data structure. The user's code would need to handle that. But according to the functions provided, the data_loading function is supposed to load the data, and then the user would access the columns. So the function calls here are data_loading first, then linear_regression_fit with the extracted columns.\n\nSo the steps are: call data_loading with file_path 'dataset.csv', then use the returned data to get x and y, then fit the model with return_residuals=True.\n\nBut in the tool calls, I need to represent these steps. The first function call is data_loading. The second is linear_regression_fit, using the data from the first call's output. However, the parameters for linear_regression_fit need to have x and y as arrays.

The user's code would have to do that, but the functions provided don't include a step to extract columns. However, the user's instruction says to set x=data['sales'] and y=data['future_sales'], so the parameters for the linear_regression_fit would be those arrays.\n\nSo the tool calls would be first data_loading, then linear_regression_fit with x and y as the respective columns from the loaded data, and return_residuals set to true.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The data_loading function returns the data structure, which the user would then use to extract the columns.

Then, for the diameter, use getDiameter for Proton and Neutron with unit 'femtometers'. \n\nWait, the parameters require 'particle' and 'unit'.

The first one is a 4x4 ft marble statue in Philadelphia, and the second is a 6x3 ft bronze sculpture in New York. \n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's get_sculpture_details and get_artwork_price. The get_artwork_price function seems relevant here because it's about retrieving the price based on material and size. But wait, the parameters for get_artwork_price require museum_location, sculpture_material, and sculpture_size. \n\nFor the first sculpture: museum_location is Philadelphia, material is marble, size is 4x4 ft. But the size parameter expects an array of integers. So I need to convert 4 ft x 4 ft into an array, maybe [4, 4]. Similarly, the second sculpture is in New York, bronze, 6x3 ft, so size [6, 3].\n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for sculpture_size are an array of integers. The user provided the dimensions as \"4 ft x 4 ft\" and \"6 ft x 3 ft\". I need to parse those into numerical values. Assuming that the size is in feet, so the array would be [4,4] and [6,3]. \n\nSo I need to call get_artwork_price twice, once for each sculpture. The first call would have museum_location: \"Philadelphia\", sculpture_material: \"marble\", sculpture_size: [4,4]. The second call would be museum_location: \"New York\", sculpture_material: \"bronze\", sculpture_size: [6,3]. \n\nWait, but the function's description says it retrieves the price based on size and material. However, the parameters also require the museum_location. The user is asking about sculptures in specific museums, so the location is necessary. \n\nSo yes, two separate calls to get_artwork_price for each sculpture. Then, once I have both prices, I can calculate the average. But the user is asking for the average price, so the system would need to get both prices first. \n\nBut the functions available don't have an average function. The user's question requires calculating the average, but the functions only retrieve individual prices. So the assistant would need to call the function for each sculpture, get the two prices, then compute the average. However, the functions themselves don't handle averaging. \n\nBut according to the problem, the assistant can only make function calls. So the assistant would need to call get_artwork_price for each sculpture, then the system would handle the average. But the user's question is asking for the average, so the assistant must make sure both prices are retrieved. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to make two separate calls to get_artwork_price with the respective parameters for each sculpture."}

John has three investment options, and he wants to calculate the returns for each using specific functions. Let me break down each option one by one.\n\nFirst option: Simple interest with $5000, 4% annual rate over 5 years. The function needed here is calc_Simple_Interest. The parameters required are principle_amount, duration, and annual_rate. So principle is 5000, duration 5, annual rate 4. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond option: Compound interest with $5000, 3.5% annual rate, compounded annually for 5 years. The function here is calc_Compound_Interest. Parameters are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq. Since it's compounded annually, compound_freq is 1. But wait, the function's default for compound_freq is 1, so maybe I don't need to specify it. But the user mentioned to use the function, so including it explicitly might be better.\n\nThird option: Initial investment of $3000 at 5% for 6 years, compounded twice a year. The function here is future_value. The parameters required are initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings. The interest rate is 5%, so 0.05 as a decimal.

The function's default for num_compoundings is 1, but here it's 2, so need to include that.\n\nWait, for the future_value function, the interest_rate is a decimal, so 5% becomes 0.05.
