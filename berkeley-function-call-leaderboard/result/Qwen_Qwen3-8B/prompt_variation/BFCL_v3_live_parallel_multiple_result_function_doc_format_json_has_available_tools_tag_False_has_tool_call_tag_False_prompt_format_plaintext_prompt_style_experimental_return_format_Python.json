The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The foodItem here is \"Caesar salad\". They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they specified \"without anchovies\", maybe that's covered under removeIngredients. So the first function call would be ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function for drinks is ChaDri.change_drink, which requires drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is \"123\". The new_preferences include size=\"large\", temperature=\"hot\", sweetness_level=\"regular\", milk_type=\"almond\".

First, they want to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function seems perfect here. I'll need the repo_url, which is provided. The destination isn't specified, so I'll use the default '.'.\n\nNext, they want to analyze the repo's contents. The analyse_repo_contents function requires the directory_name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory name. This will determine the predominant programming language, which is probably JavaScript since it's a Node.js project.\n\nThen, based on the analysis, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using '.' makes sense. The analysis might suggest a Node.js image, so the Dockerfile will be created in the root directory.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAML files. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file function requires directory_name, and optionally deployment_name, image_name, etc. The directory is '.', and since it's a Node.js app, the image name might be something like 'nodejs-welcome' with the default 'latest' tag. The user didn't specify replicas or ports, so defaults will apply.\n\nThen, add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function needs directory_name, commit_message, and branch_name. The default branch is 'main', and the commit message can be 'Update changes' as default. Force push is probably not needed unless specified.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"create/update dockerfile\" and \"kubernetes yamls based on the analysis\". The analysis might influence the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs. For example, if the repo uses Node.js, the Dockerfile will have npm install and start commands. The Kubernetes YAMLs will use the appropriate image and ports. But the functions don't take the language into account, so maybe the user expects the functions to handle that internally. Since the functions are predefined, I just need to call them with the correct parameters.\n\nSo the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes, commit and push. Each function call is needed in order. Let me make sure all parameters are covered. The directory_name for analysis is '.', which is the cloned repo. Then, the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs are created in the same directory. Finally, pushing the changes to the repo."}

First, they mentioned a compilation error in their Java project where the method 'getNumericValue()' is not found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories. So, the first function to use here is get_relevant_classes with the search_string set to 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories as true.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. For that, the get_signature function is appropriate. They'll need to call it twice: once for each method. The parameters should be class_name 'AbstractCellHandler' and the respective method names. Also, since the user is overriding methods, they might need to check if the methods are private, so including include_private as true could be helpful, though the default is false. Wait, the default for include_private in get_signature is false, so maybe they don't need to specify it unless they want to include private methods. But the user is overriding methods, which are likely public. So maybe just the method names are sufficient. \n\nWait, the user is extending 'AbstractCellHandler' and overriding methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult', which might mean that the method they're trying to override isn't present in the superclass. But the user is asking about the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure they're overriding correctly. So the get_signature calls are necessary to confirm the parameters and return types. \n\nSo the steps are: first, find classes related to 'CellResult' using get_relevant_classes. Then, get the method signatures for the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. That should cover both parts of the user's request. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. For get_relevant_classes, search_string is 'CellResult', case_sensitive defaults to false, include_subdirectories is true. For get_signature, class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler', method_name is 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. No need for include_private unless the user wants private methods, which they didn't mention. So the function calls should be correct."}

There's get_area_of_square and get_current_weather. \n\nFor the area, the function get_area_of_square requires a 'size' parameter. The user provided 5 cm, so the size is 5. The unit here is cm, but the function doesn't mention units in its parameters, just the numerical value. So I'll call get_area_of_square with size=5.\n\nNext, the weather part. The function get_current_weather needs a 'location' parameter. The user mentioned Queenstown Singapore. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but Singapore is a country. Maybe the user meant Queenstown, New Zealand, or perhaps they confused the names. But the function's example includes 'San Francisco, CA' and 'Paris, France', so the format should be 'City, Country' or 'City, State (abbr)'. \n\nThe user wrote \"Queenstown Singapore\". That could be interpreted as Queenstown in Singapore, but Singapore is a city-state, so maybe the location is 'Queenstown, Singapore'? But I'm not sure if Queenstown is actually a place in Singapore. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo. However, I should proceed with the given information. The function requires the location parameter, so I'll use 'Queenstown, Singapore' as the location. The unit is optional, defaulting to fahrenheit. The user didn't specify, so I'll use the default.\n\nSo, two function calls: one for the area and one for the weather.

Oh, the user wants both, but the function parameters have event_type as a single string with enum values of 'Music' or 'Theater'. So maybe I need to call the function twice, once for Music and once for Theater. Or perhaps the user wants both types. But the function might not support multiple types in one call. Let me check the parameters again. The event_type is a single string, so I can't specify both in one call. Therefore, I should make two separate calls: one for Music and another for Theater. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with either, but the query says \"music concerts or theater plays\", so both are acceptable. So two function calls would be necessary. But the user might not want that. Wait, the function's event_type is an enum with 'Music' and 'Theater' as options. So each call can only handle one type. Therefore, to cover both, I need two separate calls. \n\nBut the user's question is to find any music concerts or theater plays. So the answer should include both. Therefore, I should generate two function calls: one with event_type='Music' and another with event_type='Theater', both for Los Angeles on 2023-03-10. \n\nWait, but the function's parameters have event_type as a single string.
