I've formulated a few promising searches, including terms like \"Australian B-girl Paris 2024 Olympics\" and variations on that theme. I'll analyze the results to pinpoint the athlete and competition results. My next steps involve extracting the athlete's final ranking. Ascertaining Final Ranking I've been examining the information and determined that B-Girl Raygun was eliminated in the preliminary round-robin stage of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Despite not having an exact numerical ranking stated, the consistent information indicates she didn't score any points and lost all three battles 18-0. This unequivocally positions her at the bottom of the rankings, likely 16th out of 16 competitors, in her debut Olympic breaking event. Further search queries are underway to acquire the official standings. Confirming the Ranking I am trying to confirm the final rank of Rachael Gunn at the Paris 2024 Olympics. My research shows she didn't advance from the group stage, scoring no points. I've found an incomplete WDSF ranking and a Wikipedia article detailing the 17 b-girls. To give an accurate final position, I need to pinpoint the official full classification, including all competitors. I'm focusing on a more targeted search for the complete standings. Ascertaining Final Ranking I have successfully pinpointed Rachael Gunn's (Raygun) final placement in the Breaking event at the Paris 2024 Olympics. My investigation led me to the official Olympics.com website, where I confirmed \"RAYGUN\" from Australia finished in 16th place out of the 17 competitors. Considering the disqualification, the result confirms that Raygun placed 16th."
