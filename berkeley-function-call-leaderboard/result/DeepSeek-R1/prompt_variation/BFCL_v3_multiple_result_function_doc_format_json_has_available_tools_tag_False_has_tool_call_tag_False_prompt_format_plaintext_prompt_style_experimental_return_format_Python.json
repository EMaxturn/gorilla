However, note that the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for a given game, platform, and region. Since the region is set to the United States by default, we can call it without explicitly setting the region if we are okay with the default.\n\nBut note: the user is asking for the \"cheapest\" selling price. However, the function `video_games.store_price` returns the current selling price. Since the game is being sold at a single price in the PlayStation Store for the United States (unless there are different editions or versions, but the function doesn't indicate that it returns multiple prices), we assume that the function returns the current standard price.\n\nHowever, the user might be implying that we should check multiple platforms? But the query specifies \"PlayStation Store\". So we are only checking one platform.\n\nAlternatively, the user might be thinking about different regions? But the query specifies \"in the United States\". So we are only checking one region.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price for a specific game on a specific platform in a specific region. Since we are fixed on the platform (PlayStation) and the region (United States), we only need to call the function once.\n\nHowever, the word \"cheapest\" might be redundant because we are only checking one store? But the user might be under the impression that the same game might be sold at different prices in different stores of the same platform? But the function `video_games.store_price` does not take a store as a parameter, only platform and region. So we assume that the PlayStation Store in the United States has one price for the game.\n\nTherefore, we can simply call the function `video_games.store_price` with the given parameters.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` requires:\n- game_title: 'Assassins Creed Valhalla'\n- platform: 'PlayStation'\n- region: optional, but default is United States. So we can omit it.\n\nSo we call:\nvideo_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation')\n\nHowever, the user might also be interested if the game is on sale? But the question is about the current selling price, regardless of whether it's on sale or not. The function `video_games.store_price` should return the current price (which might be the sale price if it's on sale). So we don't necessarily need to check the sale status separately.\n\nBut to be safe, we might also check if the game is on sale? The user didn't ask for sale status, only the price. So we can just get the price.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be thorough and the user might be interested in the sale, we could also check the sale status? But the question is about the price, so the price function should suffice.\n\nTherefore, we only need one function call.\n\nBut note: the function `video_games.store_price` returns the price. We are to return the function call in the required format.\n\nLet's write the call:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation')]\n\nHowever, the function `video_games.store_price` has an optional parameter `region` which defaults to United States. Since the user specified the United States, we can either omit it or set it explicitly. The problem says the default is United States, so omitting is safe.\n\nBut the function signature in the parameters says: \"region: The region e.g. United States, United Kingdom, Japan. Default to United States\". So we can omit.\n\nBut note: the user's query says \"in the United States\", so we can also set it explicitly to be safe. However, the function call format requires only the required parameters? Actually, we can include optional parameters if we wish. Since the user specified the region, we can set it explicitly.\n\nLet me see: the parameters for `video_games.store_price` are:\n- game_title: required\n- platform: required\n- region: optional, but we have a value (United States) so we can include.\n\nIncluding it might be more explicit and avoid any ambiguity.\n\nSo we can do:\nvideo_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')\n\nBut note: the function description says the region is optional and defaults to United States. So both are acceptable.\n\nI'll choose to include the region to be explicit.\n\nTherefore, the function call is:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]\n\nBut wait: the user asked for the \"cheapest\" selling price. Since we are only querying one platform and one region, there is only one price. So that price is the cheapest (and only) in that context.\n\nIf the user intended to compare across platforms or regions, they would have to specify. But they didn't. So we assume they want the price in the PlayStation Store in the US.\n\nTherefore, we only need one function call.\n\nFinal answer:\n[video_games.store_price(game_title='Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform='PlayStation', region='United States')]"}

We are in a context that requires valid Python syntax? \n\n The instruction says: \"Use the following format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), ...]\"\n\n We should represent the string in quotes? But note that the example in the instruction does not show quotes for values? \n However, in the function parameters, the values for strings must be in quotes? \n\n But wait, the instruction says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format example does not have quotes? \n\n Let me check the instruction example: \n   [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]\n\n It does not show quotes. But note: in the function description, the parameters are defined as type string. \n How should we represent a string value? \n\n Since we are generating a string that will be parsed, we must use quotes to denote strings? \n\n However, the instruction does not specify. But note: the example in the function description in the given list of functions: \n   For find_exhibition, the example for location is \"New York, NY\" (with quotes in the description).\n\n But in the function call we are to generate, we are not including the quotes? \n\n Actually, the instruction says: \"Do not include any other text.\" and the format example does not have quotes.\n\n How is the system going to parse this? \n\n Let's look at the provided functions: they are in JSON and the parameters are defined. \n The system that processes the function calls will know the types and parse accordingly? \n\n We are to output the function call in a way that can be directly evaluated? Or is it just a representation?\n\n The instruction says: \"Return only the function calls in your response.\" and the format example does not use quotes for the values.\n\n However, if we output a string without quotes, it might be ambiguous. \n\n But note: the function parameters for location and art_form are strings. Without quotes, the system might misinterpret? \n\n Considering the ambiguity, I think we should output the values without quotes? Because the example in the instruction does not use quotes.\n\n Alternatively, if we output with quotes, it might break the format? \n\n Since the instruction does not specify, and the example does not have quotes, we output without quotes.\n\n However, if the value has spaces, we must be careful? Without quotes, it might be split? \n\n But note: the instruction example: \n   [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\n It does not show any spaces in the value? \n\n This is a problem. \n\n Let me see the example in the function description: \n   \"e.g., New York, NY\" -> that has spaces and commas.\n\n How can we represent that without quotes? \n\n We have two options: \n   Option 1: Without quotes: location=New York, NY -> but that would be interpreted as two arguments: New York and NY? \n   Option 2: With quotes: location=\"New York, NY\"\n\n The instruction does not specify, but to avoid ambiguity, I think we must use quotes for string values that contain non-alphanumeric characters or spaces.\n\n But note: the example in the instruction does not use quotes. \n\n However, we are generating a string that will be parsed by the system. The system might expect a specific format? \n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, I will follow the safe approach: use double quotes for string values that require them (like having spaces or commas).\n\n Alternatively, the system might be designed to parse the function call as a Python expression? Then we need quotes.\n\n But the instruction says: \"Do not include any other text.\" and the example does not have quotes? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me re-read the instruction: \n   \"Return only the function calls in your response. Use the following format: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)].\"\n\n The example does not have quotes. But note: the example values are simple (like integers) and without spaces. \n\n For the sake of this exercise, I will assume that the system expects the values without quotes and that the values are passed as tokens? \n But that won't work for \"New York, NY\" because it has a comma and space.\n\n Alternatively, we might represent the value as a single token by using underscores? But that changes the meaning.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I think we should use the same format as in the function description example: \n   In the function description, the example for location is given as a string: \"New York, NY\" (with quotes). \n\n But note: the function description is in JSON, so the quotes are part of the JSON string.\n\n How about we output the function call in a way that is valid in the context? \n\n I notice that the instruction says: \"Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax.\" for each function. \n\n So the function call should be in Python 3 syntax? Then we must use quotes for strings.\n\n Therefore, I will output the function call with double quotes for string parameters.\n\n Example: \n   find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")\n\n This is valid Python syntax.\n\n But the instruction example doesn't have quotes? \n\n However, the instruction example uses simple values without spaces. Our values have spaces and commas, so we need quotes.\n\n So let's do that.\n\n Therefore, the function call is:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n However, note that the function has a default for user_ratings as 'high'. We could omit it? \n But the user said \"top rated\", so to be explicit, we set it.\n\n Alternatively, if we omit it, the function will use the default. So we could do:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\")]\n\n But to be safe and explicit, we set user_ratings to \"high\".\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n But wait: the parameter name is \"user_ratings\" (with an 's')? \n Let me check the function parameters: \n   \"user_ratings\": { ... }\n\n Yes, it's \"user_ratings\", not \"user_rating\". So we use \"user_ratings\".\n\n Final call:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n But note: we have a typo? We wrote \"user_ratings\" correctly above, but in the last line we wrote \"user_ratings\" as \"user_ratings\"? \n Actually, in the function definition it is \"user_ratings\". So we must use \"user_ratings\".\n\n Correction: \n   user_ratings=\"high\"\n\n Therefore:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\n However, note that the function also has an optional parameter 'month'. We are not setting it because we are relying on the default (upcoming events). \n That's acceptable.\n\n We are only making one function call because the user asked for one thing: the top rated exhibition.\n\n But note: the function returns the most popular exhibitions (plural) based on the criteria? \n The user asked for \"the top rated\", which might be one? But the function returns a list? \n We don't have a parameter to limit the number? \n\n We are not asked to do anything else. We are just to return the function call.\n\n So we return the call and let the system handle the rest.\n\n Therefore, the output is:\n\n   [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"modern sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]"}
