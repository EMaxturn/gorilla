The function requires height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The default values are zero for initial_velocity and 9.81 for gravity. But the user provided height as 150 meters. Since the initial_velocity is zero, I can use the default value. So I just need to call the function with height=150 and initial_velocity=0.

The user's input has height as 150 (int), initial_velocity as 0 (int), and gravity as 9.81 (float). So all parameters are provided.

Since each roll is independent, the probability of getting a six on the first roll is 1/6. Then, for the second roll, it's still 1/6. So the combined probability would be (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nLooking at the available function, there's a dice_roll function.

Let me check the available functions. There's a function called find_recipe that takes recipeName and maxCalories. The default maxCalories is 1000, but the user specified less than 500. So I need to set maxCalories to 499. The recipe name is pasta carbonara. So I should call find_recipe with those parameters. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The function expects a string for recipeName and an integer for maxCalories. Yes, that's right. No other parameters needed here. So the tool call should be <TOOLCALL> with the function name and the parameters."}

The provided function is hotel_booking. The parameters required are location, room_type, duration, start_date, and preferences. \n\nThe user specified the location as Manhattan, New York. The room type is single. The duration is 3 nights, so duration is 3. The start date is March 10th, 2023. Preferences mention pet-friendly, but the function's preferences parameter is a list. Since the user didn't specify any other preferences, maybe I should include the default preferences. \n\nWait, the preferences parameter is optional. If not provided, it uses all. So I can leave it out. So the parameters would be location: \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type: \"single\", duration: 3, start_date: \"2023-03-10\", and preferences: [].\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included.
