It needs initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The user provided all three values: initial_speed is 20, acceleration is 10, time is 5. The rounding is optional, so maybe they want two decimal places. So I should call calculate_displacement with those values.

The user is asking for the cheapest selling price of 'Assassins Creed Valhalla' in the PlayStation Store in the United States.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's video_games.store_price, which fetches the selling price. But the question is about the cheapest price. However, the store_price function might just return the current price, not the cheapest. But maybe the function is designed to get the price, and the user wants the current price. Alternatively, maybe there's a function to find the cheapest, but looking at the provided functions, there's no such function. The available functions are store_currency, on_sale, and store_price. \n\nThe user is asking for the cheapest price, but the store_price function might not provide that. However, the on_sale function checks if the game is on sale, but that's about being discounted, not the actual price. The store_currency function is about the currency used in a region, which isn't relevant here.\n\nSo, the user's question might be expecting the current price. But since the store_price function returns the selling price, and the user wants the cheapest, maybe the answer is to call store_price with the game title, platform, and region. However, the user might not know that the store_price gives the current price, which is the cheapest. But the question is phrased as \"cheapest selling price,\" which could be ambiguous. If the store_price returns the current price, then that's the answer. If there's a function to find the cheapest, but it's not available, then we can only use the available functions.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to call video_games.store_price with the game title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', and region 'United States'. That would give the current price, which is the selling price. The user might be assuming that this is the cheapest, but if there's a sale, the price might be lower. However, the function store_price gives the current price, which is the selling price, so that's the answer."}

The user is asking to find out the final speed of an object that started from rest and traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant physics formulas. Since the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0. The distance traveled is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds. The question is about acceleration, but the user wants the final speed. \n\nWait, the functions provided are kinematics.calculate_acceleration and kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest. Let me check what each does. \n\nThe calculate_speed_from_rest function takes distance, time, and initial_speed. The description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration. But the parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). \n\nBut the user's question involves acceleration. However, the calculate_speed_from_rest function might be the right one here. Because if the object starts from rest, the initial speed is 0, and the function uses distance and time to calculate speed. But wait, the formula for speed when starting from rest is v = (2 * distance) / time. But the function's parameters are distance and time. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). So if the user provides distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0, then the function would calculate speed. But the user is asking for acceleration. However, the question is about finding the speed, not acceleration. \n\nBut the user's question says \"Find out how fast an object was going if it started from rest and traveled a distance of 20 meters over 4 seconds due to a constant acceleration?\" So they want the final speed. \n\nSo the calculate_speed_from_rest function is the right one here. Because it's designed for objects starting from rest. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed. Since initial_speed is 0, the function would compute the speed. \n\nBut wait, the function's description says it calculates speed from rest under constant acceleration. So the formula would be v = (2 * distance) / time. Let me check with the parameters. If distance is 20 meters, time is 4 seconds, then 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. So the function would return 10. \n\nBut the user is asking for the acceleration. However, the question is about speed, not acceleration. So the answer would be 10 m/s. But the user might be confused. However, the functions provided don't have a function to calculate acceleration. The calculate_acceleration function requires initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But the user hasn't provided final_speed. \n\nWait, the user hasn't given final_speed. They only gave initial_speed as 0, distance as 20, time as 4. So if we use calculate_acceleration, we need initial_speed, final_speed, time, and distance. But the user hasn't provided final_speed. So maybe the user is expecting to use calculate_speed_from_rest. \n\nSo the correct function to call is kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That would give the speed. \n\nTherefore, the function call would be to calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters. The user's question is about speed, not acceleration, so the answer is the speed calculated by that function."}

I remember that when two gases are mixed, the final temperature can be found using the principle of conservation of energy. The formula is something like (n1*T1 + n2*T2) / (n1 + n2) = T_final. Where n is the number of moles and T is the temperature.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's one called calculate_final_temperature. Let me check the parameters.

The sort_list function is for sorting a list, and it takes the elements and an order parameter.

The function requires desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The user is asking about two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The default sides_per_die is probably 6, which is standard for a die. The desired_sum is 7. So I need to call dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, and sides_per_die=6. Wait, but the sides_per_die is optional? The function's description says the default is 1, but maybe it's 6. Wait, the function's parameters have sides_per_die as an argument with a default? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the function definition: the parameters are desired_sum (int), n_rolls (int, default 1), and sides_per_die (int). So sides_per_die is optional, defaulting to 1? Wait, no, the description says \"default is 1\" but the function's parameters don't specify a default. Wait, the function's parameters are defined as:\n\nArgs:\n    desired_sum (int): The sum for which to calculate the probability.\n    n_rolls (int): Number of dice to be rolled.

The sides_per_die is probably 6 by default, but maybe the function expects it to be specified. However, since the user is talking about two standard dice, the sides_per_die should be 6. So the function call would be dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. But wait, the function's parameters have sides_per_die as an argument with a default?

Wait, the function's parameters are:\n\nThe function's parameters are:\n\n- desired_sum (int)\n- n_rolls (int, default 1)\n- sides_per_die (int)\n\nSo the default for sides_per_die is not specified. But in reality, when you roll two dice, each has 6 sides. So maybe the function assumes sides_per_die=6 by default. But the user hasn't specified it, so maybe we need to include it. However, the user is asking about two dice, so the n_rolls is 2. The sides_per_die is 6. So the function call should include all three parameters. But the user didn't mention sides_per_die, but it's necessary for the calculation. So the correct function call is dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6.
