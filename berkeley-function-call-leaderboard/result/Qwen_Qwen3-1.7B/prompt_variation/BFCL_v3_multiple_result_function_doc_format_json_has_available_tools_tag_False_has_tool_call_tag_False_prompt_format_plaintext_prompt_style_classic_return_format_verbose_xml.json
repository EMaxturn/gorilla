But wait, the on_sale function might return a sale price, but the user wants the actual price. However, the question is about the cheapest selling price, which could be the regular price or a sale price. But the user might be referring to the regular price. But the function store_price gives the selling price, which could be the regular price. However, the on_sale function might show if it's on sale, but the user wants the cheapest, so maybe store_price is the way to go.\n\nWait, the parameters for store_price require game_title, platform, and region. The user specified PlayStation Store and United States. So I need to call store_price with game_title 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform 'PlayStation', region 'United States'. The region is optional, but the user specified it, so include it. The function will return the selling price. So the correct function call is video_games.store_price with those parameters. The on_sale function might not be necessary here because the user is asking for the price, not if it's on sale. So the answer should be to call store_price with the given parameters."}

The question is about calculating the final speed.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'kinematics.calculate_speed_from_rest' which takes distance, time, and initial_speed.

The other function, calculate_acceleration, might not be needed here because the question is about speed, not acceleration. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"due to a constant acceleration,\" which implies that acceleration is constant.

Its parameters are desired_sum, n_rolls, and sides_per_die. The user mentioned two dice, so n_rolls should be 2. The sides_per_die is usually 6 for standard dice. The desired_sum is 7. The function requires desired_sum and sides_per_die, which are provided. The n_rolls is optional but here it's necessary to set to 2.

The dividend_data function seems relevant because it's specifically for dividend payments. The parameters required are company, years, and frequency. The user mentioned Apple Inc and five years, so company is Apple Inc, years is 5. The frequency is not specified, but the default is annually. So I can leave that as the default. The stock_market_data function is for stock data, not dividends, so that's not needed here.\n\nSo the correct function to call is corporate_finance.dividend_data with company=\"Apple Inc\" and years=5.

The question is about veterans, which is a demographic category. The get_demographics function's description mentions retrieving demographic data including categories like gender, race, age. Veterans might be under a demographic category. \n\nThe parameters required for get_demographics are year and category. The user provided the year 1954, so that's covered. The category would need to be \"veterans\" or something similar. But I should check if \"veterans\" is a valid category. The description says the category can be things like gender, race, age, so maybe \"veterans\" is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_population function could be used, but population categories include things like total, veterans, women. Wait, the get_population function's category parameters include \"veterans\" as an option. So maybe that's another possibility. \n\nBut the user is specifically asking about veterans, which is a demographic group. The get_demographics function is more directly about demographics, including veterans. However, the get_population function might also have a category for veterans. \n\nWait, the user's question is about veterans, which is a specific demographic group. The get_demographics function's category could be \"veterans\". So I should use get_demographics with year 1954 and category \"veterans\". \n\nAlternatively, if the get_population function's category includes \"veterans\", then that could work too. But the user is asking for veterans, which is a demographic, so get_demographics is more appropriate. \n\nI need to check if the functions are available. The user provided the three functions.
