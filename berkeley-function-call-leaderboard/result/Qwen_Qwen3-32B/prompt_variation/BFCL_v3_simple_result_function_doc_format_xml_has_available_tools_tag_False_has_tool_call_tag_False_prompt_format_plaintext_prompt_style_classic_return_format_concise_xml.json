Let me check the function's description again. The default for initial_velocity is zero, so if the user says zero, I can omit it. But maybe including it makes the input explicit. Hmm.

The user is asking for the probability of rolling a six on a six-sided die twice in a row. Hmm, so first, I need to recall how probability works for independent events. Each roll of a die is independent, right? So the probability of getting a six on one roll is 1/6. For two rolls in a row, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo the first roll has a 1/6 chance, and the second roll also has a 1/6 chance. Multiplying them together gives (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. But wait, the user mentioned a six-sided die, so the die_sides parameter would be 6. The function provided is probability.dice_roll, which takes desired_number, number_of_rolls, and die_sides (optional). \n\nThe desired_number here is 6, number_of_rolls is 2. Since the die is six-sided, maybe the die_sides parameter can be omitted because the default is 6. So the function call should include desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides=6, but since die_sides is optional and default is 6, maybe it's better to include it explicitly to avoid any confusion. Wait, the function's parameters have die_sides as optional with default 6. So including it or not is okay. But to be explicit, maybe include it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The die_sides is required=\"false\", so it's optional. The user specified a six-sided die, so the default applies. Therefore, the function call would need desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides=6. Wait, but if the default is 6, then even if we don't include die_sides, it will use 6. But since the user explicitly mentioned six-sided, maybe include die_sides=6 to be precise. However, the function's parameters might handle it either way. Let me make sure. The function's description says \"six-sided die\", but the die_sides parameter allows for other numbers. Since the user is using a six-sided die, the die_sides should be 6. So the parameters would be desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, die_sides=6. But since die_sides defaults to 6, maybe it's optional. So the function call can be made with just desired_number and number_of_rolls. Wait, the function's parameters for die_sides are required=\"false\", so it's optional. Therefore, the correct function call would be to pass desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides=6. Or can we omit die_sides? Let me check the function's parameters again. The die_sides is optional, so if not provided, it uses 6. Since the user is using a six-sided die, we can omit die_sides. Therefore, the function call should be probability.dice_roll with desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2. That should calculate (1/6)^2 = 1/36. So the answer would be 1/36, which is approximately 0.0278 or 2.78%. The function should handle that calculation. So the correct function call is to use desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2, and die_sides=6 (but since die_sides is optional, maybe just the first two parameters). Wait, the user's question says \"six-sided die\", so the die_sides is 6. The function's default is 6, so we can omit it. Therefore, the function call is probability.dice_roll(desired_number=6, number_of_rolls=2). That should give the correct probability."}

The start_date is after January 1, 2021, so I should format that as MM-DD-YYYY, which would be 01-01-2021. The location is California, which is the full state name. Since the status is 'ongoing', which is the default, I don't need to include it unless the user specifies a different status. The user did mention 'ongoing', so maybe include it explicitly? Wait, the default is already ongoing, so if the user says 'ongoing', it's the same as not specifying. But maybe the user wants to make sure, so including it might be better. However, according to the function's parameters, status is optional and defaults to 'ongoing'. So including it or not is okay. But since the user specified 'ongoing', maybe include it to be explicit.\n\nWait, the user's query says \"ongoing lawsuits\", so the status is definitely 'ongoing'. Since the function's default is 'ongoing', even if we omit the status parameter, it should still work. But to be precise, maybe include it. However, the function's parameters might require that if the user specifies a status, it's included. But since the user is asking for ongoing, which is the default, maybe it's redundant. But the user might have intended to include it. Let me check the function's parameters again. The status is a string, required false, default 'ongoing'. So if the user wants the default, we can omit it. But since the user explicitly said 'ongoing', perhaps including it is better. However, the function's documentation says that the default is 'ongoing', so even if we don't include it, it should still work. But maybe the user wants to ensure that only ongoing cases are included, so including the status parameter would make it explicit.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should make the function call with the parameters. So the required parameters are company, start_date, location. The status is optional. Since the user specified 'ongoing', which is the default, but maybe the user wants to make sure that the status is set to ongoing. However, the function's default is already ongoing, so including it is optional. But to be safe, perhaps include it. Wait, but the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, point it out. But in this case, the user provided all required parameters. The start_date is January 1, 2021, formatted as 01-01-2021. The location is California. The company is Google. The status is ongoing. So the function call would include company, start_date, location, and status. But since status is optional, maybe it's better to include it. Let me check the example in the problem statement. The example shows that if a parameter is optional and the default is specified, you can omit it. But since the user explicitly mentions 'ongoing', perhaps it's better to include it. However, the function's default is 'ongoing', so even if we don't include it, the function will use that. But the user's query says 'ongoing', so including it is correct. Therefore, the parameters would be company: 'Google', start_date: '01-01-2021', location: 'California', status: 'ongoing'.\n\nWait, but the start_date is 'after January 1, 2021'. The user says 'after', but the function's parameter is 'start_date' which is the start of the date range. Does the function interpret start_date as 'on or after'? The description says 'Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed'. So if the user wants after January 1, 2021, then the start_date should be 01-01-2021, and the function would include lawsuits filed on that date and later. But the user says 'after', which might mean excluding that date. However, the function's parameters might not support an end date. Wait, looking at the function's parameters, there's only start_date. There's no end_date parameter. The function's parameters only have start_date. So the function allows searching for lawsuits filed on or after the start_date. The user's query says 'after January 1, 2021', which would mean start_date is 01-02-2021. But the user might have intended 'on or after'. Since the function's description says 'start of the date range', perhaps the start_date is inclusive. Therefore, if the user says 'after', maybe the start_date should be the next day. However, the user wrote 'after January 1, 2021', which is a bit ambiguous. But given that the function's parameter is start_date, and the user's instruction is to use the given functions, perhaps the best approach is to use the date as given. The user wrote 'after January 1, 2021', so the start_date would be 01-01-2021. Wait, no. If the user wants lawsuits filed after that date, then the start_date should be 01-02-2021. But the user might have intended 'on or after', so perhaps the correct start_date is 01-01-2021. Since the function's parameter is the start of the date range, and the user's query says 'after', which is ambiguous, but given that the function's start_date is the start, perhaps the user intended to include January 1, 2021. Therefore, the start_date is 01-01-2021. \n\nSo putting it all together, the function call would be:\n\nlawsuit_search with company=Google, start_date=01-01-2021, location=California, status=ongoing.\n\nBut since status is optional and the default is ongoing, maybe it's not needed. But the user explicitly mentioned 'ongoing', so including it is better. Therefore, the function call includes all four parameters."}

Newton's work is called \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", but the user mentioned \"law of universal gravitation\", which is part of that. Hmm, but maybe the function can handle it if I use the common name. Let me check the parameters again. The function's description says it fetches the year based on author and work title. So I'll input Isaac Newton as the author and \"law of universal gravitation\" as the work_title. The location is optional, so I can omit it. Let me make sure both parameters are required. Yes, the XML shows both author and work_title are required. So the function call should be publication_year.find with author set to \"Isaac Newton\" and work_title set to \"law of universal gravitation\". I'll format that correctly."}
