The only function is `log_food`, which logs a food item with details.\n\nThe function requires:\n- food_name: str\n- portion_amount: Any (could be a number or something else)\n- portion_unit: str (default is 'grams', but can be others like 'ounces', 'pieces', etc.)\n- meal_name: str (e.g., 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'snack')\n\nThe user's message has multiple parts:\n1. \"For breakfast I had a 12 ounce iced coffee and a banana.\"\n   - Foods: iced coffee (12 ounces), banana (no portion specified)\n   - Meal: breakfast\n\n2. \"For lunch I had a quesadilla\"\n   - Food: quesadilla (no portion specified)\n   - Meal: lunch\n\n3. \"Breakfast four ounces of asparagus, two eggs, one piece of gluten free bread.\"\n   - This seems like a continuation or another breakfast entry.\n   - Foods: asparagus (four ounces), two eggs (implies 2 pieces?), one piece of gluten-free bread\n   - But it says \"Breakfast\" again, which might be a typo or meant to be another meal.\n\nThe last part says \"Breakfast four ounces...\", which is unclear. It might be intended as another breakfast item or a separate message. I'll treat it as part of the breakfast description.\n\nI need to break this down into individual food items to log, since the function logs one food at a time.\n\nList out the foods:\n- Iced coffee: food_name=\"iced coffee\", portion_amount=12, portion_unit=\"ounce\", meal_name=\"breakfast\"\n- Banana: food_name=\"banana\", portion_amount= not specified. The function requires portion_amount, so I need to point out if it's missing. The user didn't specify, so I can't log it without assuming.\n- Quesadilla: food_name=\"quesadilla\", portion_amount= not specified, meal_name=\"lunch\"\n- Asparagus: food_name=\"asparagus\", portion_amount=4, portion_unit=\"ounces\", meal_name=\"breakfast\" (assuming from the context)\n- Eggs: food_name=\"eggs\", portion_amount=2, portion_unit=\"pieces\" (or something similar), meal_name=\"breakfast\"\n- Gluten-free bread: food_name=\"gluten free bread\", portion_amount=1, portion_unit=\"piece\", meal_name=\"breakfast\"\n\nFor items without specified portions, like banana and quesadilla, the function requires portion_amount. I should not assume values; instead, I need to point out if parameters are missing. But my instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" However, I must only return function calls in the response, and if I can't, point it out \u2013 but the format is to only include function calls or indicate if none can be used.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. You should only return the function calls in your response.\"\n\nIt also says: \"You MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)] if invoking, otherwise, I suppose, not include it.\"\n\nRe-reading: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format... You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.\"\n\nFor missing parameters, I need to point it out, but how? The prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But it doesn't specify the format for that. However, it emphasizes to only return function calls.\n\nI should only call functions for the ones that have all required parameters.\n\nRequired parameters for log_food: food_name, portion_amount are mandatory; portion_unit has a default; meal_name is required as per the function def.\n\nIn the function: def log_food(food_name: str, portion_amount: Any, portion_unit: str = 'grams', meal_name: str)\n\nSo, food_name, portion_amount, and meal_name are required; portion_unit is optional with default.\n\nFor each food:\n1. Iced coffee: has food_name, portion_amount (12), portion_unit (ounce), meal_name (breakfast) \u2013 all good.\n2. Banana: food_name (banana), portion_amount (missing), meal_name (breakfast) \u2013 missing portion_amount.\n3. Quesadilla: food_name (quesadilla), portion_amount (missing), meal_name (lunch) \u2013 missing portion_amount.\n4. Asparagus: food_name (asparagus), portion_amount (4), portion_unit (ounces), meal_name (breakfast) \u2013 good.\n5. Eggs: food_name (eggs), portion_amount (2), portion_unit (implied pieces), meal_name (breakfast) \u2013 I can assume portion_unit as 'pieces'.\n6. Gluten-free bread: food_name (gluten free bread), portion_amount (1), portion_unit (piece), meal_name (breakfast) \u2013 good.\n\nFor eggs and bread, portion_unit isn't specified, but I can choose one, like 'pieces'.\n\nI can call log_food for the ones that have at least food_name, portion_amount, and meal_name.\n\nSo, I'll call for:\n- Iced coffee\n- Asparagus\n- Eggs (with portion_unit='pieces')\n- Gluten-free bread (with portion_unit='piece')\n\nFor banana and quesadilla, since portion_amount is missing, I won't call the function for them.\n\nIn my response, I need to output multiple function calls if applicable, in the format: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params), ...]\n\nI should make one call per food item.\n\nFinally, once I have no more to call, the system will handle it.\n\nSo, my response should be a list of function calls for the valid ones."}
