The user is asking for the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the kinematic equations. Since it's starting from rest, initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance and time, and we need to find the final speed. But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Do they want the final speed at the end of the 4 seconds, or the average speed during the 4 seconds? The wording says \"how fast an object was going\", which usually refers to instantaneous speed at the end. But let me check the functions available.\n\nLooking at the functions provided: there's calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest. The calculate_speed_from_rest function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over a distance. The parameters are distance, time, and initial_speed (default 0). So maybe this function can be used here. Let me check the parameters. The user provided distance=20 meters, time=4 seconds, and initial speed is 0 since it starts from rest. So plugging those into the function should give the final speed. \n\nWait, but the calculate_speed_from_rest function's parameters are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). The user's values are 20 and 4, which are integers. So that's okay. The function should return the final speed. Let me make sure the formula is correct. The formula for final speed when starting from rest and moving with constant acceleration over distance d and time t... Wait, the standard equations are:\n\ns = ut + 0.5*a*t\u00b2. Since initial speed u is 0, s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2. So acceleration a = 2s / t\u00b2. Then final speed v = u + at = 0 + (2s/t\u00b2)*t = 2s/t. So in this case, v = 2*20 /4 = 10 m/s. \n\nBut the function calculate_speed_from_rest might be using this formula. Let me check the function's description again. It says \"speed of an object that starts from rest under a constant acceleration over a specified distance\". Wait, but the parameters are distance and time. So maybe the function is using the formula v\u00b2 = 2ad, where d is distance. Because if starting from rest, v\u00b2 = 2ad. Then v = sqrt(2ad). But we don't have acceleration here. However, the function might be combining the equations. Alternatively, since we have time and distance, maybe the function uses the average speed? Wait, average speed would be total distance over total time, which is 20/4 = 5 m/s. But that's average speed. But the question is asking for how fast it was going, which is likely the final speed. \n\nBut how does the function calculate_speed_from_rest work? Let me think. If the function is using the formula for final velocity when starting from rest and moving with constant acceleration over a distance, then the formula is v = sqrt(2ad). But we don't have acceleration. However, if we have the time and distance, we can find acceleration first. Let's see. From s = 0.5*a*t\u00b2, so a = 2s/t\u00b2. Then substituting into v = at, we get v = 2s/t. Which in this case is 2*20/4 = 10 m/s. So the final speed is 10 m/s. \n\nThe function calculate_speed_from_rest, given distance and time, should compute this. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (default 0). Since initial speed is 0, we can call the function with distance=20, time=4. So the correct function to use here is calculate_speed_from_rest with those parameters. Therefore, the tool call should be to that function with distance 20 and time 4."}

Oh, wait, no, maybe n_rolls is the number of times you roll the dice, but in this case, each die is rolled once. Wait, maybe the function is designed such that each roll is a single die. Wait, the description says \"number of dice to be rolled\". Oh right, so if you have two dice, n_rolls is 2. And sides_per_die is 6 by default, but the user didn't specify any different, so we can assume standard 6-sided dice.\n\nSo the desired_sum is 7. The number of dice is 2. So the parameters would be desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2, sides_per_die=6. Let me make sure. The function calculates the probability of the sum of the dice. For two six-sided dice, the number of possible combinations is 6*6=36. The number of ways to get 7 is 6 (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1). So probability is 6/36 = 1/6. The function should compute that. So the correct function call is dice_roll_probability with desired_sum=7, n_rolls=2. Since sides_per_die defaults to 6, we don't need to specify it unless it's different. So the parameters in the function call would be desired_sum=7 and n_rolls=2. Wait, but the function's default for n_rolls is 1. So to specify two dice, we need to set n_rolls=2.
