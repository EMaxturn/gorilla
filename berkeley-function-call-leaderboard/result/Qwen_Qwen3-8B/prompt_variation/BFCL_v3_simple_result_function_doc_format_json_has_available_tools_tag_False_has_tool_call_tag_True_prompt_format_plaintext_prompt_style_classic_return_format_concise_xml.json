Gravity has a default value of 9.81, so unless they mention a different gravity, I don't need to change that. So the parameters would be height=150, initial_velocity=0.

{"id": "simple_380", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to book a single room at a pet-friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York, for 3 nights starting March 10th, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The hotel_booking function is the one to use here. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are location, room_type, duration, and start_date. The preferences are optional but can include pet_friendly.\n\nThe user specified \"pet friendly\", so I should include that in the preferences array. The location is \"Manhattan, New York\", room_type is \"single\", duration is 3 nights. The start_date is March 10th, 2023. I need to format the date correctly, maybe as \"2023-03-10\" or \"March 10, 2023\". The function's example might use a specific format, but since it's a string, I'll go with the user's input format unless told otherwise. Wait, the parameter description says \"date when your stay begins\" so maybe \"2023-03-10\" is better. But the user wrote \"March 10th, 2023\", so perhaps it's okay to use that. Alternatively, maybe the function expects a date string in a specific format like YYYY-MM-DD. But since the user provided it as \"March 10th, 2023\", I'll use that unless there's a reason to change it. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for start_date have a type of string, but no specific format. So I'll use the user's input. So start_date is \"March 10th, 2023\". \n\nPreferences: the user mentioned pet_friendly, which is one of the allowed options. So the preferences array should include \"pet_friendly\"? Wait, no. The preferences are not specified. Wait, the function call needs to be in the format specified. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nWait, the function call should be in the format <TOOLCALL> with the function calls. So, the user is asking for the function calls.
