The provided function is uber.ride, which requires loc, type, and time parameters. \n\nThe location given is 123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704. The function's loc parameter expects a string in 'Address, City, State' format. The example uses '123 Main St, Springfield, IL', so the user's input seems to fit that format. However, the address has '\u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc' which is Vietnamese for 'University Road'. The function might expect an English address, but the description doesn't specify that. Maybe it's okay as long as it's a valid address.\n\nThe type is 'Plus', which matches the enum values ['plus', 'comfort', 'black']. So 'Plus' should be converted to 'plus' as per the function's parameters. Wait, the user wrote 'Plus' with a capital P, but the enum has 'plus' in lowercase. So I need to make sure the parameter is lowercase. But the function's parameters are case-sensitive? The description says the enum includes 'plus', so the correct value is 'plus'.\n\nThe time is 10 minutes, which is an integer. The user said they don't want to wait more than 10 minutes, so the time parameter should be 10.\n\nPutting it all together: loc is '123 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc, Berkeley, CA 94704', type is 'plus', time is 10. \n\nWait, but the address format might need to be in English. The example uses '123 Main St', but the user's address is in Vietnamese. However, the function's description doesn't specify that the address must be in English. Maybe the system can handle Vietnamese addresses. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the address is supposed to be in English. But the user provided it as is, so I should use it as given.\n\nSo the function call should be uber.ride with those parameters. Let me double-check the required parameters: loc, type, time.

The example URL is 'https://{ip}/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.

The parameters required are fabricName, nodeId, podId, interfaceType, and infoType. The user provided all these. However, I should check if the parameters match the expected types. nodeId and podId are integers, which they are (12 and 10). interfaceType is 'Ethernet', which is in the enum as 'ethernet' (lowercase). Wait, the enum has 'gigabitethernet', 'fastethernet', 'ethernet', 'serial'. So the user's input is 'Ethernet' with a capital E, but the enum expects lowercase. So maybe the function expects 'ethernet' as the value. Similarly, infoType is 'Speed', but the enum has 'Speed' as one of the options. Wait, looking back, the infoType enum is ['statistics', 'status', 'config', 'Speed']. So 'Speed' is capitalized. So the user's input is correct here.\n\nSo the params would be fabricName='Network1', nodeId=12, podId=10, interfaceType='ethernet', infoType='Speed'. Wait, but the user wrote 'Ethernet' for interfaceType. Need to make sure that the enum matches. The enum includes 'ethernet' as a valid value. So the user's parameter is 'Ethernet', but the correct value should be 'ethernet' in lowercase. However, maybe the API is case-insensitive, but the function's parameters specify the enum as lowercase. So perhaps the user made a typo, but the function expects 'ethernet'. So I should use 'ethernet' as the interfaceType.\n\nSo the final params would be:\n\nparams = {\n    'fabricName': 'Network1',\n    'nodeId': 12,\n    'podId': 10,\n    'interfaceType': 'ethernet',\n    'infoType': 'Speed'\n}\n\nThen the url is constructed as per the example.

So the url is 'https://192.120.45.67/sedgeapi/v1/cisco-nir/api/api/telemetry/flowrules/interfaceInfo'.\n\nSo the function call would be requests.get with these parameters.

The user is looking for a housewife who provides ironing services in Chiang Mai, specifically in Sankampang District, Ton Pao Subdistrict, with a 4.5-star rating.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The function provided is getDataForProfessional, which retrieves professionals based on criteria like service type, location, availability, and rating. \n\nLooking at the parameters required: service_id, province_id, and others. The service_id for ironing is 2, as per the enum [1,2,3]. The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district_name is Sankampang, and the sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating is 4.5. \n\nI should make sure all required parameters are included. Service_id and province_id are required. The district and sub-district names are optional but provided by the user. The rating is also specified. \n\nSo, the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name='Sankampang', sub_district_name='Ton Pao', and rating=4.5.

The user didn't mention availability dates or late check-ins, so those defaults are fine. \n\nAlright, the final function call should include all the specified parameters."}
