There's a function for that: ChaFod, which is for changing the food item.\n\nLet me look at ChaFod's parameters:\n\n- foodItem (str): The name of the food item to be modified. So, for this, it should be \"Caesar salad\".\n\n- newIngredients (str, default=''): A comma-separated list of new ingredients. The user isn't adding any new ones.\n\n- removeIngredients (str, default=''): A comma-separated list of ingredients to remove. The user wants to remove anchovies, so this would be \"anchovies\".\n\n- specialInstructions (str, default=''): Any special instructions. None mentioned here.\n\nSo, I can call ChaFod with foodItem=\"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients=\"anchovies\".\n\nNext, for the drink: The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nThere's a function: ChaDri.change_drink\n\nParameters:\n\n- drink_id (str): The unique identifier of the drink. The user said \"order 123\", so I'll assume that's the drink_id, like \"123\".\n\n- new_preferences (dict): The updated preferences for the drink. So, I need to provide a dictionary with the new preferences.\n\nWhat are the preferences? \"large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk\".\n\nI need to format this as a dict. Possible keys might be size, type, sweetness, milk, etc. Since it's not specified, I'll make a reasonable dict, like {'size': 'large', 'type': 'hot coffee', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk': 'almond milk'}.\n\nThe function expects a dict, so I can pass something like that.\n\nI need to make sure the type is correct. In the function call format, for params, the type should be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. So, for new_preferences, it's a dict, which is allowed.\n\nI have to call two functions: one for food and one for drink.\n\nIn my response, I need to put both in the <TOOLCALL> section, as multiple functions can be called.\n\nThe format is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"func_name1\">\n\n<param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"func_name2\">\n\n...\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, for ChaFod:\n\n<function name=\"ChaFod\">\n\n<param name=\"foodItem\" type=\"string\">Caesar salad</param>\n\n<param name=\"removeIngredients\" type=\"string\">anchovies</param>\n\n</function>\n\nFor ChaDri.change_drink, the function name is \"ChaDri.change_drink\". In the provided list, it's written as \"# Function: ChaDri.change_drink\", so I think the full name is \"ChaDri.change_drink\".\n\nIn the initial description, it's \"ChaDri.change_drink\", so I'll use that as the function name.\n\nFor new_preferences, it's a dict, so in the XML-like format, I need to represent it as a string that can be parsed as a dict, but according to the instructions, I just put the value, and it should be fine as long as I specify the type as \"dict\".\n\nIn the example: <param name=\"param3\" type=\"type3\">value</param>\n\nFor a dict, I can put the dict as a string, like '{\"key\": \"value\"}'.\n\nSo, for new_preferences: <param name=\"new_preferences\" type=\"dict\">{'size': 'large', 'type': 'hot coffee', 'sweetness': 'regular', 'milk': 'almond milk'}</param>\n\nThat should work.\n\nFinally, my response should only contain the <TOOLCALL> section, nothing else.\n\nI think that's all. The user provided all necessary parameters, so no need to point out any lacks."}

The description says: \"For control commands, the input must clearly specify 'power on' or 'start'. To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nIt also says: \"the command must be specified as a string in Korean...

So, it's not applicable here.\n\nThe problem is that get_interviewer_list only takes one skill.

Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI have the following functions available:\n\n- clone_repo: This can clone the repository.\n\n- create_a_docker_file: This generates a Dockerfile in a specified directory.\n\n- create_kubernetes_yaml_file: This generates Kubernetes YAML files.\n\n- analyse_repo_contents: This analyzes the repo and determines the predominant language.\n\n- push_git_changes_to_github: This pushes changes, and it automatically adds all changes.\n\nI need to sequence these function calls based on the user's request. I should make one or more function calls in my response, and continue until I can fulfill the request.\n\nStart with step 1: Clone the repo.\n\nI need to use clone_repo. The repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'. Other parameters like destination can default, recursive can be False, and depth can be omitted.\n\nSo, first function call: clone_repo with repo_url.\n\nAfter cloning, I need to analyze the contents. So, next, use analyse_repo_contents. It requires directory_name, which would be the name of the directory where the repo was cloned. By default, it's cloned to the current directory, so probably the repo name, like 'nodejs-welcome'. I need to assume it's the default or specify it.\n\nIn clone_repo, destination defaults to '.', so it clones into the current directory. For analyse_repo_contents, directory_name should be the path relative to the root, probably 'nodejs-welcome' if that's the repo name.\n\nThe user didn't specify the directory name explicitly, but from the repo URL, it's 'zelarhq/nodejs-welcome', so likely the directory will be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen, based on the analysis:\n\n2.1 Create/Update Dockerfile: Use create_a_docker_file with the directory_name.\n\n2.2 Create Kubernetes YAML: Use create_kubernetes_yaml_file with the directory_name and other params.\n\nAfter that, add all changed files: The push_git_changes_to_github function automatically does git add all, so I can use that directly for committing and pushing.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github says: \"This function will automatically git add all changes.\" So, it handles adding, committing, and pushing.\n\nThe user's step 3 is \"add all changed file to git changes\", and step 4 is \"commit / push\".\n\nSince push_git_changes_to_github does all that, I can call it last.\n\nI need to ensure the order: First clone, then analyze, then create files based on analysis, then push.\n\nThe functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML don't directly depend on the analysis output; they just take directory_name and other params. However, the user says \"based on the analysis\", but in the tools, analyse_repo_contents just analyzes and probably returns the language, but I don't have a way to use that output in subsequent calls directly.\n\nIn this setup, I have to call functions sequentially, and the system will handle the output. So, I'll assume that after calling analyse_repo_contents, I can proceed to call the creation functions.\n\nIn my response, I need to output the function calls in the specified format.\n\nSince this might require multiple steps, I should output the first one or more that I can do now.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, in this response, I should output all the necessary function calls in sequence.\n\nFinally, once I have no more, the system proceeds.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. Call clone_repo with repo_url = 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n2. Then, call analyse_repo_contents with directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome' (assuming that's the directory)\n\n3. Then, call create_a_docker_file with directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome'\n\n4. Then, call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome' and other defaults.\n\n5. Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name = 'nodejs-welcome', and perhaps a commit message.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has more params like deployment_name, which defaults, image_name defaults to 'latest', etc. I can use defaults.\n\nSo, in my <TOOLCALL>, I need to include all these as separate <function> elements.\n\nThe format allows multiple <function> in <functions>.\n\nI should put them in the order they need to be executed.\n\nOne potential issue: Does the system execute them in order? I assume yes.\n\nAlso, ensure parameter types: For example, repo_url is string, directory_name is string, etc.\n\nAlright, let's prepare the response."}

So, these aren't suitable for fetching real-time info.\n\nFor the first part: The user wants information on events since October 2021, but only after 2022.

Find the highest common factor for 36 and 48. This is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n2. Tell me how steep the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 is at x = 5. This sounds like they want the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 5.\n\nI have two functions available:\n\n- math_gcd: This takes two non-negative integers and calculates their GCD. Perfect for the first part.\n\n- estimate_derivative: This estimates the derivative of a function at a point. I can use this for the second part.\n\nFor the first part: math_gcd requires two parameters: a (int) and b (int). The user provided 36 and 48, both non-negative integers. I need to decide which is larger; the description says \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\". 48 is larger than 36, so I should set a=48 and b=36.\n\nThe function description says: \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\". So, I must ensure a is the larger one. Yes, so for 36 and 48, a should be 48 and b should be 36.\n\nFor the second part: estimate_derivative requires:\n\n- function: A callable object. The user mentioned f(x) = x^2, but I need to provide it as a callable. In this setup, I can't directly define a function here. The function description says \"function (any): The mathematical function...\", but in the context of this tool, I might need to assume how to pass it.\n\nThis is a problem. The function parameter is specified as \"any\", but in my tool call format, I have to specify the type as one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. \"Any\" isn't in that list. How do I handle this?\n\nLooking back: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nFor estimate_derivative, the parameters are:\n\n- function: type is \"any\", but I need to map it to one of the allowed types. Perhaps I can treat it as a string, like representing the function as a string, e.g., \"x**2\".\n\nThe function description says: \"function (any): The mathematical function... provided as a callable object.\"\n\nIn this text-based system, I can't pass a actual callable object. I need to improvise. Maybe represent it as a string that describes the function.\n\nIn the tool call format, I have to specify a type. For \"function\", since it's not fitting, perhaps I can use \"string\" and pass something like \"lambda x: x**2\".\n\nThat might work. In many APIs, functions are passed as strings or lambdas.\n\nSo, for estimate_derivative, I'll need:\n\n- function: Let's say as a string, e.g., \"lambda x: x**2\"\n\n- x: 5, which is a float, so type=\"float\"\n\n- dx: optional, default 0.0001, I can leave it out or specify.\n\n- method: optional, default 'central', I can leave it out.\n\nThe user didn't specify dx or method, so I'll use defaults.\n\nNow, I need to make function calls. The system says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.

It's a string representation of a lambda function.\n\nI think that's acceptable.\n\nAlright, let's outline the response:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"math_gcd\">\n\n<param name=\"a\" type=\"integer\">48</param>\n\n<param name=\"b\" type=\"integer\">36</param>\n\n</function>\n\n<function name=\"estimate_derivative\">\n\n<param name=\"function\" type=\"string\">lambda x: x**2</param>  // Assuming string for the function\n\n<param name=\"x\" type=\"float\">5</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nOne more thing: The user said \"tell me\", which implies I need to output results, but according to the instructions, I should only return function calls, and the system will handle the rest.

The instructions say: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nThe function is described as \"any\", but I have to choose from the list. A lambda function is a callable, which isn't directly in the list. I need to represent it as a string or something? The example in the function description says \"like the lambda x\", so probably I can pass it as a string that represents the lambda.\n\nIn the function args, it's \"function (any): A callable function\", but for my tool call, I have to specify a type from the allowed ones. Perhaps I can use \"string\" and pass the lambda as a string.\n\nBut that might not work, because the function expects a actual callable, not a string.\n\nThis is a problem.

The user wants to flip it horizontally, so this matches.\n\n- rotateImageAction: This rotates the image clockwise by a specified degree. The user wants to turn it by 20 degrees, which I assume means rotate by 20 degrees.\n\nSo, I need to call both functions: one for rotation and one for flipping.\n\nThe user didn't specify any image to work on. For rotateImageAction, it requires 'degrees', 'image_format', and 'keep_original'. It doesn't explicitly require an image path or data, but in the context, we might assume there's an image in context. However, looking at other functions like removeBackgroundAction, it requires 'image_path'. rotateImageAction doesn't list an image parameter, which is odd. Let me double-check:\n\nFrom the description:\n\n# Function: rotateImageAction\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Rotates the image clockwise by a specified degree of angle. Accepts an integer value representing the angle in degrees. \n\n    Args:\n\n        degrees (int): The degree of clockwise rotation to be applied to the image. Value must be between 0 and 360 degrees.\n\n        image_format (str, default='JPEG'): The format of the image to be rotated. For example, 'JPEG', 'PNG', 'BMP', etc.\n\n        keep_original (bool, default=True): Indicates whether the original image should be kept unchanged. If set to false, the original image will be overwritten.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\nIt doesn't specify which image to rotate. This is a problem.

Must be either 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\nNeither function specifies an image to operate on. But other functions like removeBackgroundAction have 'image_path'. This might be an oversight in the provided functions, or perhaps it's assumed in the system.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in the response format, I should only return the function calls or nothing if I can't.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" And \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\nI need to check if the question provides all necessary parameters. For rotateImageAction, it needs 'degrees' (20), but not 'image_format' or 'keep_original' since they have defaults. However, it implicitly needs an image, which isn't specified.\n\nFor flipImageAction, it only needs 'flip_direction' ('horizontal').\n\nSince the functions don't explicitly list an image parameter, I might proceed, but that doesn't make sense. Perhaps in this system, the image is implied or handled elsewhere.\n\nTo be precise, I should call the functions as they are defined.\n\nThe user request has two parts: rotate by 20 degrees and flip horizontally.\n\nI need to make function calls for both.\n\nFirst, call rotateImageAction with degrees=20.\n\nSecond, call flipImageAction with flip_direction='horizontal'.\n\nThe order might matter, but the user said \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally,\" so perhaps rotate first, then flip.\n\nIn the response, I need to output them in a <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nThe format is: <TOOLCALL><functions><function name=\"func_name1\">...</function><function name=\"func_name2\">...</function></functions></TOOLCALL>\n\nI can include multiple functions in one TOOLCALL.\n\nParameters types: For rotateImageAction:\n\n- degrees: int, so 20 as integer.\n\n- image_format: str, default 'JPEG', so I can omit if using default.\n\n- keep_original: bool, default True, so omit.\n\nFor flipImageAction:\n\n- flip_direction: str, 'horizontal'.\n\nSo, I can call:\n\nFirst function: rotateImageAction with param degrees as integer 20.\n\nSecond function: flipImageAction with param flip_direction as string 'horizontal'.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nOne potential issue: Does the system know which image to apply this to? Since it's not specified in the functions, I'll assume it's okay.\n\nFinal response: Output the TOOLCALL with both functions."}

The user mentioned \"music or theater events\", so I need to specify this. It could be \"music\" or \"theater\". The function might allow for one type, so I might need to call it twice or choose one. The description says \"The category of the cultural event\", implying one at a time. But the user said \"music or theater\", so perhaps I should call it for each.\n\nThe function is designed to take one event_type.

But the function takes a single string for event_type. I could use a value like \"music,theater\" if it accepts it, but from the description, it's probably one.\n\nTo be precise, I'll assume I need to specify one.

I need to check: it says \"bool, default='dontcare'\", but 'dontcare' isn't a bool.

The system prompt says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nIn the function, it's defined as bool, but with a default of 'dontcare', which is a string. To be precise, I'll check the args: \"is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\"\n\nI should treat it as a boolean, but since the default is 'dontcare', and the user didn't specify, I should omit it or use 'dontcare'. In the function call, if I don't provide it, it might use default, but I need to explicitly call it.\n\nThe prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But for this, is_unisex is optional with a default.\n\nIn the function description: \"is_unisex (bool, default='dontcare')\", so I can omit it, and it will use default.\n\nIn my function call, if I don't include it, that's fine.\n\nFor Services_1_BookAppointment, all params are required, and they are provided.\n\nSo, I'll call both functions.\n\nFirst function: Services_1_FindProvider with city=\"Sunnyvale, CA\"\n\nSecond function: Services_1_BookAppointment with stylist_name=\"Elegant Styles\", appointment_time=\"15:00\", appointment_date=\"2023-05-10\"\n\nTypes:\n\n- For Services_1_FindProvider:\n\n  - city: str\n\n  - is_unisex: bool (but I'm not including it)\n\n- For Services_1_BookAppointment:\n\n  - stylist_name: str\n\n  - appointment_time: str\n\n  - appointment_date: str\n\nMy response should only be the <TOOLCALL> section with these functions."}
