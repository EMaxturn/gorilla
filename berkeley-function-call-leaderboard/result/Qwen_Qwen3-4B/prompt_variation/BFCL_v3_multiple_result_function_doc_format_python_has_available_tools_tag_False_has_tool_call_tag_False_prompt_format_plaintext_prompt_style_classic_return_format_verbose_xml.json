Since the question is about displacement, I should use the calculate_displacement function.\n\nChecking the parameters for calculate_displacement: it requires initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optionally rounding. The user provided all three required values: 20, 10, and 5. The rounding is optional, but the user didn't specify, so maybe use the default of 2 decimals. So I need to call the function with those parameters. The other function, calculate_final_speed, isn't needed here because the question is about displacement, not final speed. So the correct function call is kinematics.calculate_displacement with the given values."}

The store_price function fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. Since the user is asking about the price, I should use store_price. The parameters needed are game_title, platform, and region. The user specified the game title as 'Assassins Creed Valhalla', platform as PlayStation Store, and region as United States. All required parameters are provided, so I can call store_price with these values. The other functions don't relate to price, so they aren't needed here. I don't see any missing parameters, so the function call should be straightforward."}

The description says it calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given the width and length. That's exactly what the user needs. The parameters required are width and length, both integers. The user provided both values: width 7 and length 10. So I should call that function with those parameters. The other functions are for squares and circles, which don't apply here.

Hmm, the functions available are calculate_acceleration and calculate_speed_from_rest.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the final speed. The calculate_speed_from_rest function seems relevant here because it's designed for objects starting from rest. Let me check the parameters of that function. The args are distance (int), time (int), and initial_speed (int, default 0). The user provided distance 20 meters and time 4 seconds, and since it's from rest, initial_speed is 0. So I can use calculate_speed_from_rest with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That should give the final speed. The other function, calculate_acceleration, might not be needed here because the question is about speed, not acceleration. So the correct function to call is calculate_speed_from_rest with the given parameters."}

The user wants to calculate the final temperature when 2 moles of gas at 300 K are mixed with 3 moles of the same gas at 400 K. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for mixing gases. Since they are the same gas, the molar heat capacities should be the same. The formula for the final temperature when two quantities of gas at different temperatures are mixed is based on the conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hotter gas equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But since they are the same gas, the formula simplifies to (quantity1 * temperature1 + quantity2 * temperature2) / (quantity1 + quantity2). \n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's a function called calculate_final_temperature which takes quantity1, temperature1, quantity2, and temperature2 as parameters. The parameters are all integers here. The user provided all the necessary values: quantity1 is 2, temperature1 is 300, quantity2 is 3, temperature2 is 400. So I can directly use this function. \n\nI don't need to use the calculate_mass function here because the problem is about temperature mixing, not mass.

So I need to call sort_list with elements as the list and order as 'asc'. \n\nWait, the parameters require the order to be a string. The function's default is already 'asc', so maybe I can just pass the elements. But the user explicitly said ascending, so maybe it's better to include order='asc' to be explicit. Either way should work. Let me make sure the function is called correctly. The elements are ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Jack'], so the function call would be sort_list with those elements and order 'asc'. \n\nI think that's all. No other functions are needed here.

The years should be 5.
