The user wants to log their food intake.

The function requires food_name, portion_amount, portion_unit, meal_type (default is snack), and log_date. The user didn't specify the date and time, so I might need to ask for that, but since the current date is 2023-10-04, maybe assume it's today. However, the user mentioned \"earlier,\" so maybe two different times. But without specific times, perhaps just use the current date with different times for each entry. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the log_date, which is required. Hmm, the problem says if parameters are missing, point it out. But the user might expect me to proceed with the current date.
