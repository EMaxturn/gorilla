The function needs initial_speed, acceleration, time, and optional rounding. The user provided all three required parameters: 20 m/s, 10 m/s\u00b2, and 5 seconds. No rounding specified, so I can omit that. So I should call the calculate_displacement function with those values.

The user specified the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as United States.

The user wants to find out the speed of an object that started from rest, traveled 20 meters in 4 seconds with constant acceleration. Hmm.\n\nFirst, starting from rest means the initial speed is 0. The problem gives distance (20m) and time (4s). They want the final speed. \n\nI remember there are kinematic equations. One of them relates distance, time, initial speed, and acceleration. But since the acceleration isn't given, maybe I need to find acceleration first and then use it to find the final speed.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the speed, which is the final speed. Let me check the available functions. There's 'calculate_acceleration' which needs initial_speed, final_speed, and time, but here we don't have final_speed. Alternatively, maybe 'calculate_speed_from_rest' which takes distance, time, and initial_speed (which is 0 here). Let me check the parameters of that function.\n\nThe 'calculate_speed_from_rest' function requires distance (integer, 20), time (integer, 4), and initial_speed (optional, but here it's 0). Since the object starts from rest, initial_speed is 0. The function's description says it calculates the speed under constant acceleration over the distance. That seems exactly what's needed here. So I can call this function with distance=20, time=4, and initial_speed=0. But wait, the initial_speed parameter is optional, so maybe it's not required. Wait, the function's parameters list initial_speed as required=false. So if the user starts from rest, initial_speed is 0, and maybe the function assumes that if not provided. But the function's parameters say initial_speed is an integer and required=false. So perhaps the function is designed to handle cases where initial speed is given, but if not, maybe it defaults to 0. However, the user specified that the object started from rest, so initial_speed is 0. So I should include it. But the function's parameters for initial_speed are of type integer. The user's input is 0, which is an integer. So the call would be distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. \n\nAlternatively, if the function is designed for objects starting from rest, maybe initial_speed is always 0 and the parameter is redundant. But the function's parameters include it as optional. So to be safe, include initial_speed=0. \n\nTherefore, the correct function to use is 'calculate_speed_from_rest' with distance=20, time=4, initial_speed=0. That should give the final speed."}
