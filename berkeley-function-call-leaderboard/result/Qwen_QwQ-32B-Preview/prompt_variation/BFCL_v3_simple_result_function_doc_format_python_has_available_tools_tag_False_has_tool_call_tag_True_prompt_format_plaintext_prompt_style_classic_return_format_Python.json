{"id": "simple_19", "result": "Alright, I need to calculate the greatest common divisor, or GCD, of two numbers: 40 and 50. I remember that the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, for 40 and 50, I need to find the biggest number that can divide both.\n\nI think there's a function that can help me with this. Looking back at the list of functions provided, there's one called \"math.gcd\". It says it computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Perfect, that's exactly what I need.\n\nSo, to use this function, I need to provide two parameters: num1 and num2. In this case, num1 is 40 and num2 is 50. So, I should call the function like this: math.gcd(num1=40, num2=50).\n\nI should make sure that both numbers are integers since the function expects integers. 40 and 50 are both integers, so that's good.\n\nI don't think there are any other parameters I need to worry about here. The function seems straightforward: just input the two numbers and it should return their GCD.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential errors or edge cases.

{"id": "simple_25", "result": "Alright, I have this problem here: I need to calculate the final velocity of an object that's falling from a 150-meter building, and I'm told to assume that the initial velocity is zero. Okay, let's see. I have a function called `calculate_final_velocity` that seems perfect for this task. It takes three arguments: height, initial_velocity, and gravity. The default value for initial_velocity is zero, which matches what the problem says, and gravity is set to 9.81 m/s\u00b2, which is Earth's gravity, so that should be fine too.\n\nSo, the height is 150 meters, initial velocity is zero, and gravity is 9.81 m/s\u00b2. I think I can just plug these values into the function. Wait, actually, the function has default values for initial_velocity and gravity, so if I call the function with just the height, it should use those defaults.\n\nLet me check the function signature again:\n\n`calculate_final_velocity(height, initial_velocity=0, gravity=9.81)`\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I can call it like this:\n\n`calculate_final_velocity(height=150)`\n\nThat should give me the final velocity I'm looking for. I don't think I need to worry about anything else here, as the problem is straightforward, and the function is designed exactly for this kind of calculation.\n\nI should also make sure that the units are consistent. The height is in meters, initial velocity is in m/s, and gravity is in m/s\u00b2, so everything matches up.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. I'll go ahead and call the function with the height of 150 meters.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the final velocity of an object falling from a height of 150 meters, assuming an initial velocity of zero and accounting for the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe will use the provided function `calculate_final_velocity` which computes the final velocity of a free-falling object based on the height it is dropped from, its initial velocity, and the acceleration due to gravity. The function signature is as follows:\n\n```python\ncalculate_final_velocity(height, initial_velocity=0, gravity=9.81)\n```\n\nGiven that the initial velocity is zero and the default gravity value is appropriate for Earth, we can call the function with only the height parameter.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```python\ncalculate_final_velocity(height=150)\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Function Selection**: We use the `calculate_final_velocity` function, which is designed to calculate the final velocity of a free-falling object under gravity, ignoring air resistance.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - `height`: 150 meters (the height from which the object is dropped).\n   - `initial_velocity`: 0 m/s (as specified in the problem).\n   - `gravity`: 9.81 m/s\u00b2 (Earth's gravity, default value).\n\n3. **Calculation**: By providing the height and relying on the default values for initial velocity and gravity, the function will compute the final velocity of the object just before it hits the ground.\n\nThis approach ensures a straightforward and accurate calculation of the object's final velocity based on the given parameters and physical principles.", "input_token_count": 380, "output_token_count": 685, "latency": 20.833219289779663}
{"id": "simple_58", "result": "To answer this question, I need to understand the role of ATP synthase specifically within the mitochondria. ATP synthase is a crucial enzyme involved in the production of ATP, which is the primary energy currency of the cell. Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nOxidative phosphorylation consists of two main parts: the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. The electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions, and this process creates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP synthase then uses this proton gradient to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.\n\nSo, in the context of mitochondria, ATP synthase plays a central role in energy production by coupling the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain to the synthesis of ATP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{ATP synthase in mitochondria functions to produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, utilizing the proton gradient created by the electron transport chain.}} \\]", "input_token_count": 347, "output_token_count": 233, "latency": 7.8083131313323975}

I think there's a function for this called `update_user_info`. Let me see how it works.\n\nSo, `update_user_info` requires three things: `user_id`, which is an integer, `update_info`, which is a dictionary containing the new information, and `database`, which is a string with a default value of 'CustomerInfo'.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that my user ID is correctly provided. It's 43523, which is an integer, so that should be fine.\n\nNext, the `update_info` parameter needs to be a dictionary with the fields I want to update. In this case, I want to update the 'name' to 'John Doe' and the 'email' to 'johndoe@email.com'. So, the dictionary should look like this: `{'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@email.com'}`.\n\nThe database parameter has a default value of 'CustomerInfo', which is probably where my information is stored, so I don't need to change that unless specified otherwise.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that I'm calling this function correctly. I should pass the `user_id` as 43523 and the `update_info` as the dictionary I just mentioned.\n\nI should also confirm that the database name is correct. Since it's set to 'CustomerInfo' by default, and that's likely the correct database, I can proceed with that.\n\nI need to be careful with the data types. The `user_id` should be an integer, and it is. The `update_info` should be a dictionary, and I've constructed it correctly.\n\nI should also ensure that the fields in the `update_info` dictionary match the field names in the database. Assuming that the database has 'name' and 'email' fields, this should work fine.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there are any restrictions or validations on the email format. But since the function doesn't mention any, I'll proceed with the provided email address.\n\nI should also think about whether this function returns any value or provides any feedback on whether the update was successful. If it's important to know whether the update worked, I might need to check the function's documentation or implementation.\n\nAssuming that calling this function will update the information successfully, I can proceed with the function call.\n\nSo, the function call should look like this:\n\n`update_user_info(user_id=43523, update_info={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@email.com'})`\n\nI don't need to specify the `database` parameter since it's set to 'CustomerInfo' by default.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential errors that could occur during this function call, such as the user ID not existing or issues with the database connection. But for now, I'll assume that the function handles these cases appropriately.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to make this function call to update my customer information.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo update the user information in the database, we can use the `update_user_info` function. This function requires the user's ID and the new information to be updated.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Use the `update_user_info` function to modify the user's data.\n2. **Prepare Parameters**:\n   - `user_id`: The unique identifier for the user.\n   - `update_info`: A dictionary containing the fields to be updated and their new values.\n3. **Call the Function**: Invoke the function with the appropriate parameters to update the user's information.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nupdate_user_info(user_id=43523, update_info={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@email.com'})\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **update_user_info**: This function updates the specified user's information in the database.\n  - `user_id`: Specifies which user's information to update.\n  - `update_info`: A dictionary with keys representing the fields to update and their corresponding new values.\n  - `database`: Optionally specifies the database name, defaulting to 'CustomerInfo'.\n\nBy calling `update_user_info` with the provided `user_id` and `update_info`, the user's name and email in the database will be updated to 'John Doe' and 'johndoe@email.com', respectively.", "input_token_count": 348, "output_token_count": 952, "latency": 26.905231952667236}

Now, for conditions, it's a list of conditions for the query. I need to specify that age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'. I'm not exactly sure how to format these conditions, but I'll have to figure that out.\n\nMaybe the conditions are dictionaries, with keys like 'column', 'operator', and 'value'. For example, one condition could be {'column': 'age', 'operator': '>', 'value': 25}, and another {'column': 'job', 'operator': '=', 'value': 'engineer'}.\n\nSo, the conditions list would look like:\n\nconditions = [\n\n{'column': 'age', 'operator': '>', 'value': 25},\n\n{'column': 'job', 'operator': '=', 'value': 'engineer'}\n\n]\n\nThen, I can pass this list to the database.query function.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the operator should be a string like '>' or if there's an enum or something.

Let me write that down: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. Now, let's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 * 3 is 9.\n\nThen, 9 * 3 is 27.\n\nFinally, 27 * 3 is 81.\n\nSo, 3 to the power of 4 is 81.\n\nBut I think there might be a better way to calculate powers, especially for larger numbers.

So, breaking this down:\n\n- Year: 2020\n\n- Crime type: Theft\n\n- Location: Los Angeles, California\n\nWait a minute, the function expects the location in the format of just the city name. So, for location, I should probably just put \"Los Angeles\", not \"Los Angeles, California\". Although, I should confirm if the function can handle the full name with the state or if it strictly needs just the city.\n\nAssuming it needs just the city name, I'll use \"Los Angeles\".\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the crime type is correctly specified.

The status has a default value of 'ongoing', which is exactly what I need, so I don't have to specify that unless I want to look for something else.\n\nFirst, the `company` parameter should be 'Google'. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, `start_date` needs to be in the format MM-DD-YYYY. The user specified after January 1, 2021, so I'll use '01-01-2021' for the start date.\n\nThen, `location` should be the full state name, which is 'California'.\n\nSince I want ongoing lawsuits, I can let the `status` parameter default to 'ongoing', so I don't need to specify it.\n\nWait a minute, the user said \"filed after January 1, 2021\", but the function expects a start date for when the lawsuit was filed. Does this include lawsuits filed on or after that date? I think it's standard to include the start date, so '01-01-2021' should cover lawsuits filed on or after that date.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the date format is correct. MM is month, DD is day, YYYY is year. So '01-01-2021' is January 1, 2021.\n\nI should also check if there's an end date. The function only takes a start date, so if I need to specify an end date, maybe there's another parameter I'm missing. Let me double-check the function description.\n\nAh, it only has `start_date`, not `end_date`. Maybe it searches from the start date onwards. If I need to set an end date, perhaps there's another parameter or another function for that. But for now, since the user didn't specify an end date, I'll assume they want lawsuits filed after January 1, 2021, up to the present.\n\nAlright, so my function call should look like this:\n\n`lawsuit_search(company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California')`\n\nI think that should do it. I'll go ahead and make that call.\n\n**Function Call:**\n\n`lawsuit_search(company='Google', start_date='01-01-2021', location='California')`", "input_token_count": 377, "output_token_count": 579, "latency": 17.37211298942566}

Let's see what it does.\n\nSo, `get_top_cases` retrieves a list of the most influential or landmark cases in a specific field of law. It takes three arguments: `field_of_law`, `top_number`, and `country`. The `field_of_law` is the area of law we're interested in, like constitutional law or criminal law. `top_number` is how many cases we want to get, and `country` specifies which country's law cases we're looking for. It looks like the default country is the United States, but I can specify China.\n\nIn this case, the user wants top 10 landmark cases in constitutional law in China. So, I'll set `field_of_law` to \"constitutional law\", `top_number` to 10, and `country` to \"China\".\n\nI need to make sure that the function can handle requests for countries other than the US. Since the default is the US, specifying China should work if the function supports multiple countries.\n\nI should also check if the function recognizes \"constitutional law\" as a valid field of law. Constitutional law is a standard area of law, so it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the function has data on Chinese law cases.

I have a function called `map_service.get_directions` that can help with this.

The `start` is the beginning location, which is New York in this case, and `end` is the destination, which is Los Angeles. The `avoid` parameter is a list of route features to avoid, and by default, it avoids highways and ferries.\n\nBut in my request, I want to avoid highways and toll roads. Hmm, the default avoids highways and ferries, but I need to make sure toll roads are also avoided. Maybe I need to specify both highways and toll roads in the `avoid` list.\n\nLet me check the function description again. It says `avoid (list): Route features to avoid. Default is ['highways', 'ferries']`. So, if I don't provide the `avoid` parameter, it will avoid highways and ferries. But since I also want to avoid toll roads, I need to include that in the list.\n\nSo, I should call the function with `start='New York'`, `end='Los Angeles'`, and `avoid=['highways', 'toll roads']`. Wait, does the function recognize 'toll roads' as a valid option? I'm not sure. Maybe I need to check what options are available for the `avoid` parameter.\n\nAssuming that 'toll roads' is a valid option, the function call would look like this: `map_service.get_directions(start='New York', end='Los Angeles', avoid=['highways', 'toll roads'])`.\n\nBut if 'toll roads' isn't a recognized option, I might need to find another way to avoid them. Maybe there's another parameter or a different function that can help with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function has an option to avoid tolls specifically.

I've been provided with a function called `get_instrument_info` that seems perfect for this job. Let's see how I can use it.\n\nSo, the function `get_instrument_info` takes three arguments: name, maker, and year. According to the user's request, the name is 'Violin', the maker is 'Stradivarius', and the year is 1721. I need to make sure that I pass these values correctly to the function.\n\nFirst, I should confirm that 'Stradivarius' is indeed the maker. I know that Antonio Stradivari was a famous luthier who made violins, so that checks out. The year 1721 falls within his active period, as he was making instruments from around 1660 to 1737.\n\nI need to ensure that the arguments are in the correct format. The name is a string, maker is a string, and year is an integer. In the user's query, name='Violin', maker='Stradivarius', and year=1721 seem to match these types.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether there might be multiple instruments that fit this description. Stradivarius made many violins, so it's possible that there are several from 1721. Maybe I should consider if there's a way to specify further, like an unique identifier for the violin, but based on the function provided, it seems to retrieve information based on these three parameters.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the function returns all details about the instrument or just specific information. The description says it retrieves \"details,\" but doesn't specify what that entails. It might include things like the instrument's history, materials used, current owner, etc. I'll have to assume that it provides a comprehensive overview based on the input parameters.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the function can handle variations in the input. For example, if I capitalize \"Violin\" differently or if there are alternative names for Stradivarius. But since the function requires exact matches, I should input the names as precisely as possible.\n\nI should also think about error handling. What if the instrument doesn't exist in the database? Or if the year is incorrect? The function might return an error or some indication that the instrument wasn't found. I need to be prepared to handle such scenarios.\n\nGiven that, I should probably call the `get_instrument_info` function with the provided parameters and see what it returns. If it doesn't find the instrument, I might need to look for alternative ways to retrieve the information, but since I don't have other functions available, I'll have to rely on this one.\n\nWait a minute, the user might have more specific questions in the future, but for now, they just want details about this one violin. So, focusing on this single task should suffice for now.\n\nIn summary, I need to execute the `get_instrument_info` function with name='Violin', maker='Stradivarius', and year=1721 to retrieve the details about this specific instrument.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo retrieve the details about the musical instrument 'Violin' made by 'Stradivarius' in the year 1721, we can use the `get_instrument_info` function. This function requires three parameters: the name of the instrument, the maker, and the manufacturing year.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Required Parameters**: Determine the name, maker, and year from the user's request.\n2. **Call the Function**: Use the `get_instrument_info` function with the identified parameters to fetch the details of the instrument.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n<ToolCall>\nget_instrument_info(name='Violin', maker='Stradivarius', year=1721)\n</ToolCall>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the parameters needed for the function call. In this case, the name is 'Violin', the maker is 'Stradivarius', and the year is 1721.\n- **Step 2**: Invoke the `get_instrument_info` function with these parameters to retrieve the details about the specified musical instrument.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately request the information for the particular instrument of interest, leveraging the provided function to handle the retrieval process.", "input_token_count": 351, "output_token_count": 939, "latency": 25.23025417327881}
{"id": "simple_284", "result": "Alright, I need to find information about pop concerts in New York for next month. I have a function called `concert_info.get` that can help with this. It takes three parameters: location, date, and genre.\n\nSo, for location, it's New York. Date is next month, and genre is pop. I should make sure that the date is specified correctly. Maybe I need to find out what the dates are for next month.\n\nLet's see, if today is October 15th, 2023, then next month would be November 2023. So, the date range would be from November 1st to November 30th, 2023.\n\nI should probably format the date parameter in a way that the function can understand. Maybe it expects a string like \"November 2023\" or \"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30\".\n\nI need to check the function documentation to see the expected format for the date parameter.\n\nAssuming it accepts \"month yyyy\" format, I'll use \"November 2023\". If it needs a date range, I'll have to provide \"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30\".\n\nSimilarly, for the genre, it's pop.\n\nSo, the function call would look like:\n\nconcert_info.get(location=\"New York\", date=\"November 2023\", genre=\"pop\")\n\nOr perhaps:\n\nconcert_info.get(location=\"New York\", date=\"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30\", genre=\"pop\")\n\nI need to make sure I use the correct date format.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any specific venues or additional filters I might want to apply, but based on the user's request, just getting pop concerts in New York for next month should suffice.\n\nI should also think about what information the function returns. Does it give details about each concert, like the artist, time, ticket prices, etc.? I need to know what to expect so I can present the information to the user effectively.\n\nAssuming the function returns a list of concerts with details, I can then format that information in a user-friendly way.\n\nAlternatively, if the function returns raw data, I might need to process it to extract the relevant information.\n\nWait, maybe the function has a specific return format. I should check the documentation for `concert_info.get`.\n\nAssuming it returns a list of dictionaries, each containing concert details like artist name, date, time, venue, and ticket information.\n\nSo, after getting the data, I can iterate through the list and collect the necessary information to present to the user.\n\nI should also handle cases where there are no concerts matching the criteria. For example, if there are no pop concerts in New York next month, I need to inform the user accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider error handling. What if the function fails to retrieve the information due to network issues or other problems? I should have a plan for how to handle such scenarios.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function works correctly and returns the desired data.\n\nSo, the first step is to call `concert_info.get` with the appropriate parameters.\n\nOnce I have the data, I can process it and prepare a response for the user.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fulfill the user's request for information about pop concerts in New York for next month, we will utilize the `concert_info.get` function. This function allows retrieval of concert details based on specified genre, location, and date.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Determine Parameters:**\n   - **Location:** New York\n   - **Date:** Next month (e.g., if today is October 15, 2023, next month is November 2023)\n   - **Genre:** Pop\n\n2. **Format Date:**\n   - Decide on the date format expected by the function (e.g., \"November 2023\" or \"2023-11-01 to 2023-11-30\").\n\n3. **Function Call:**\n   - Invoke `concert_info.get` with the determined parameters.\n\n4. **Handle Results:**\n   - Process the returned data to extract relevant concert information.\n   - Handle cases where no concerts are found or if there are errors in retrieval.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom concert_info import get\n\ndef get_pop_concerts_in_ny():\n    # Determine the date for next month\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    today = datetime.today()\n    next_month = today + timedelta(days=30)\n    next_month_start = next_month.replace(day=1)\n    next_month_end = next_month_start.replace(day=next_month_start.month % 12 + 1, day=1) - timedelta(days=1)\n    date_str = next_month_start.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") + \" to \" + next_month_end.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    \n    # Get concert information\n    concerts = get(location=\"New York\", date=date_str, genre=\"pop\")\n    \n    # Process and return the results\n    if concerts:\n        return \"\\n\".join([f\"{concert['artist']} - {concert['venue']} on {concert['date']}\" for concert in concerts])\n    else:\n        return \"No pop concerts found in New York for next month.\"\n\n# Example usage\nprint(get_pop_concerts_in_ny())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the start and end dates for next month to format the date parameter correctly.\n\n2. **Function Invocation:**\n   - Call `concert_info.get` with the location set to \"New York\", date set to the calculated date range for next month, and genre set to \"pop\".\n\n3. **Result Processing:**\n   - If concerts are found, format and return a string listing each concert's artist, venue, and date.\n   - If no concerts are found, inform the user accordingly.", "input_token_count": 326, "output_token_count": 1275, "latency": 32.66527247428894}

I have a function called `boardgame.get_info` that seems perfect for this task. It allows me to retrieve detailed information about a board game by providing the game's name and specifying the parameters I'm interested in.\n\nSo, first things first, I need to make sure I'm using the function correctly. The function `boardgame.get_info` takes three arguments: `name`, which is the name of the board game; `parameters`, which is a list of specific game characteristics I want to know about; and `language`, which is optional and defaults to English if not specified.\n\nIn this case, the game's name is 'Ticket to Ride', and I'm interested in its rating and player count. So, I should set the `parameters` list to include 'rating' and 'player count'.\n\nI don't have any preference for the language, so I can leave the `language` parameter out, and it will default to English.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this function call. I need to pass the game name as a string, and the parameters as a list of strings. So, it should look something like this:\n\n```python\nboardgame.get_info(name='Ticket to Ride', parameters=['rating', 'player count'])\n```\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential issues. For example, maybe there are multiple games with similar names, or perhaps the game is known by different names in different regions. But since 'Ticket to Ride' is a well-known game, I think the function will be able to retrieve the correct information.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the function might return more information than just the rating and player count, but since I've specified only those parameters, it should focus on providing just that.\n\nI should also ensure that the function call is formatted correctly for the system to understand. The instruction says to use a specific format for the function call, encapsulating it within `<TOOLCALL>` tags.\n\nSo, my response should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\n<TOOLCALL>boardgame.get_info(name='Ticket to Ride', parameters=['rating', 'player count'])</TOOLCALL>\n```\n\nI need to make sure that I don't include any extra text within the `<TOOLCALL>` tags, as per the instructions.\n\nOnce the function is executed, it should return the rating and player count for 'Ticket to Ride', which I can then use to answer the user's question.\n\nI think that's all I need to do for now.

{"id": "simple_335", "result": "Alright, I need to find a card in the deck that's a Queen of Hearts. I've got this function called `find_card_in_deck` that seems perfect for this job. It takes arguments for the rank and suit, and optionally, a deck if I have a specific one in mind. Since no specific deck is mentioned, I'll assume it's a standard 52-card deck.\n\nSo, the rank I'm looking for is 'Queen', and the suit is 'Hearts'. I should call the function with these parameters. Let me make sure I'm using the right format. The function expects the rank and suit as strings, and the deck as a list, but since I'm not providing a custom deck, I can probably just omit that parameter.\n\nI think the call should look like this: `find_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts')`. I'll go ahead and make that call to see if the card is in the deck.\n\n**Function Call:**\n\n```\nfind_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts')\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\nI expect the function to return the card if it finds a Queen of Hearts in the deck. Since it's a standard deck, there should be one Queen of Hearts. If the deck is shuffled, it might be in any position, but the function should locate it regardless.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n- If the deck is not a standard deck and is provided as a parameter, I need to ensure that the deck is correctly formatted.\n\n- If the card isn't found, the function should probably return a message indicating that.\n\n- Make sure that the rank and suit are spelled correctly, as the function might be case-sensitive.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nAfter calling the function, I'll need to check the output to see if the card was found. If it was, great! If not, I might need to look into why it wasn't found, perhaps there's an issue with the deck or the parameters.\n\n**Additional Thoughts:**\n\nI should also consider if there are multiple decks or if the deck has been modified in any way. But since no such information is provided, assuming a standard single deck should be sufficient.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nProceed with calling `find_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts')` to locate the Queen of Hearts in the deck.\n\n**Final Function Call:**\n\n```\nfind_card_in_deck(rank='Queen', suit='Hearts')\n```\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nThe function should return the Queen of Hearts card if it exists in the deck, confirming its presence.\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\nTo find the Queen of Hearts in a deck, use the `find_card_in_deck` function with the parameters `rank='Queen'` and `suit='Hearts'`.
