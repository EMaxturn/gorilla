The user needs an Uber Plus ride from '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA' and is willing to wait up to 10 minutes. Looking at the functions provided, there's 'uber.ride' and 'uber.ride2'. \n\nFirst, check the parameters required for each. The 'uber.ride' function requires 'loc', 'type', and 'time'. The 'uber.ride2' also needs 'loc', 'type', and has a 'time' with a default of 10.\n\nThe user provided the location as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', which fits the 'loc' parameter. The type is 'Plus', which is in the enum. The time is 10 minutes. \n\nWait, the 'uber.ride2' has a default time of 10, but the user specified 10, so maybe either function could work. However, the first function 'uber.ride' requires 'time' as a required parameter, so it's necessary to include it. The second function's 'time' is optional with a default, but since the user provided it, maybe it's better to include it in both.\n\nBut the user's question mentions 'loc' in the format 'Street Address, City, State', which matches the 'loc' parameter for 'uber.ride'. The 'uber.ride2' uses 'City, State' for loc, but the user's address includes the street. However, the 'uber.ride' function's 'loc' example is 'Street Address, City, State', so that's the correct one to use here. \n\nSo the correct function to call is 'uber.ride' with loc as '2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA', type 'plus', and time 10. The 'uber.ride2' might not be necessary here since the user's location includes the street address, which is required by 'uber.ride'. \n\nTherefore, the tool call should be to 'uber.ride' with the given parameters."}

The user is asking for Shishir Patil's birthday and wants a congratulatory message sent to him. First, I need to figure out how to get Shishir Patil's birthday. The available functions include recalling memory, core memory, and archival memory. Since the user hasn't provided any specific information about Shishir Patil's birthday in the conversation history, I should check the recall memory first.\n\nWait, the recall memory search function allows searching through conversation history. But if the user hasn't mentioned Shishir Patil's birthday before, then maybe the birthday isn't in the recall memory. Alternatively, maybe the core memory has some information. But core memory is initialized with the persona and user details. The user mentioned \"human\" sub-block, which stores key details about the user. However, the user here is asking about Shishir Patil, who might be a different person. \n\nWait, the user is asking to send a message to Shishir Patil, so perhaps the user is Shishir Patil himself, or maybe the user is someone else. But the problem is that the system doesn't have access to external data like public information about people's birthdays unless it's stored in the memory. Since the user hasn't provided any prior information about Shishir Patil's birthday, the system can't retrieve it from the existing memory. \n\nSo, the functions available are send_message, pause_heartbeats, message_chatgpt, core_memory_append, core_memory_replace, recall_memory_search, archival_memory_insert, archival_memory_search, http_request. \n\nSince the user is asking for a birthday message, but there's no function to look up public information, the system can't find Shishir Patil's birthday. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without that information. However, maybe the user expects the assistant to generate a message based on the assumption that the birthday is known. But according to the functions provided, there's no way to retrieve external data. \n\nWait, maybe the user is testing if the assistant can use the http_request function to fetch the birthday from an external source. But the user hasn't provided any URL or API for that. The assistant can't make assumptions about external data sources. Therefore, the assistant can't retrieve Shishir Patil's birthday. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should inform the user that the birthday information isn't available. However, the user might expect the assistant to proceed with a generic message. But according to the functions, the assistant can't look up external data. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the required parameters are missing. \n\nWait, the user's question is to send a congratulatory message to Shishir Patil, but the assistant doesn't have the birthday. So, the assistant can't send the message without knowing the birthday. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the birthday isn't available. However, the assistant's functions don't include a way to get that information. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the send_message function to send a message without the birthday, but that's not what the user asked. The user specifically asked for a birthday message, which requires knowing the date. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the required parameters (birthday) are missing, so the function can't be called. The assistant should point out that the birthday information is not available."}

They want an overview of their business checking account at U.S. Bank for the period October 1, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The account number is given, along with the account holder's name, starting and ending balances, total deposits, and withdrawals. They also want a summary of transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. The BankStatementOverView function seems relevant here because it provides an overview of a bank statement, including account info and transaction summary. The parameters required are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. \n\nThe user provided the bank name as U.S. Bank, account number, account type is checking, full name is SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING. The transaction overview needs total deposits, total withdrawals, start and end dates. The user has provided all these: total deposits $7,132.76, withdrawals $5,927.40, start date October 1, 2019, end date October 31, 2019. \n\nWait, the BankStatementOverView function's transaction_overview is a dictionary with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. So I need to structure that. Also, the starting and ending balances are provided, but the function parameters don't include those. However, the user mentioned they want the overview to include the balances, so maybe the function's transaction_overview includes those? Wait, looking back, the transaction_overview in BankStatementOverView has total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The starting and ending balances are part of the parameters for the function? Wait, no. The parameters for BankStatementOverView are bank_name, account_number, account_type, full_name, and transaction_overview. The transaction_overview is a dict with the totals and dates. The starting and ending balances are not part of the parameters for this function. But the user provided those numbers. Hmm, maybe the function is designed to include those in the overview, but the parameters don't have them. Wait, maybe the function's transaction_overview is just the totals and dates, and the starting and ending balances are part of the account info? Or perhaps the user's provided balances are not needed here. Wait, the user's question says they want the overview to include the beginning and ending balances, along with the transaction summary. But according to the function's parameters, the transaction_overview only includes total deposits, withdrawals, start and end dates. So maybe the starting and ending balances are part of the account info, but the function doesn't take them as parameters. However, the user is asking for the overview to include those. Maybe the function is designed to calculate those based on the deposits and withdrawals? Or perhaps the user's provided balances are not needed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the BankStatementOverView function to include the starting and ending balances in the overview, but the parameters don't include them. However, the user has provided those numbers, so perhaps they need to be included in the transaction_overview? Wait, looking at the function's parameters again: the transaction_overview is a dict with total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The starting and ending balances are not part of that. So maybe the function's output includes those, but the parameters don't require them. Therefore, the user's provided starting and ending balances might not be needed for the function call, but the user wants them included in the overview. \n\nBut the user is asking for the overview to include the beginning and ending balances, so perhaps the function is designed to include those. However, the parameters for the function don't include them. Therefore, maybe the function is supposed to calculate the ending balance based on the starting balance, deposits, and withdrawals. Let me check the parameters of the TotalTransactions.calculate function. That function requires starting_date, ending_date, total_deposits, total_withdrawals, starting_balance, ending_balance. But the user has provided starting and ending balances. However, the BankStatementOverView function doesn't take those as parameters. \n\nWait, the user is asking for an overview that includes the beginning and ending balances. So maybe the BankStatementOverView function is not the right one here. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the BankStatementOverView to include those balances in the output, even though the parameters don't include them. But according to the function's parameters, the transaction_overview only includes the deposits, withdrawals, start and end dates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the BankStatementOverView to include the starting and ending balances as part of the overview, but the function's parameters don't have those. Therefore, perhaps the user's provided starting and ending balances are not needed for the function call, but the function's output will include them. However, the user is asking for the overview to include those, so maybe the function is designed to include them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the BankStatementOverView to be called with the transaction_overview including the deposits, withdrawals, start and end dates, and the starting and ending balances are part of the account info. But the function's parameters don't include those. \n\nIn any case, the user has provided all the necessary parameters for the BankStatementOverView function. The transaction_overview needs to have total_deposits, total_withdrawals, start_date, end_date. The user provided those: total_deposits is $7,132.76, total_withdrawals is $5,927.40, start_date is 2019-10-01, end_date is 2019-10-31. \n\nSo the function call would be to BankStatementOverView with the parameters:\n\nbank_name: \"U.S. Bank\"\naccount_number: \"1-523-1713-5704\"\naccount_type: \"checking\"\nfull_name: \"SILVER BUSINESS CHECKING\"\ntransaction_overview: {\n  \"total_deposits\": 7132.76,\n  \"total_withdrawals\": 5927.40,\n  \"start_date\": \"2019-10-01\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2019-10-31\"\n}\n\nBut the user also mentioned the starting balance was $5,532.01 and ending balance $6,737.37. However, the function's parameters don't include those, so maybe they are not needed here. The function's transaction_overview doesn't include those, so perhaps the user's request for the overview to include those is handled by the function's output, even though the parameters don't include them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the BankStatementOverView to be called with the starting and ending balances, but the function's parameters don't have those. Therefore, the function call would not include those, but the user's request is to include them. However, the function's parameters don't have those, so perhaps the user's request is not fully met. But given the available functions, the BankStatementOverView is the best fit. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is to BankStatementOverView with the provided parameters. The user also asked for a summary of transactions, which the transaction_overview in the function includes. So that should cover the request."}

The function's parameters accept the host as a string, so I'll use it as is. The username and password are provided. \n\nSo the parameters should be: host 'http://plgah.ca', username 'pascal', password 'securepassword123', database 'maindb', and port 5432 (default).

The database is optional but the user specified it, so include it.

That sounds exactly like what the user is asking for.\n\nNow, checking the parameters required for get_tech_stack. The required parameter is employee_id. The user provided the employee ID as \"Adriel\", so I should use that. Wait, but the parameter expects a string, so \"Adriel\" is fine as the employee_id. \n\nThe other parameters are include_tools (default False) and as_of_date (default None).

Since the question is about the tech stack Adriel was working on, I think the default parameters are acceptable here. \n\nSo the function call should be get_tech_stack with employee_id set to \"Adriel\". The other parameters can stay at their defaults. I don't see any missing parameters here. The user didn't mention anything about tools specifically, but the function includes them by default. Wait, the include_tools parameter is set to False by default. So the function will return languages and frameworks, not tools. But the user just asked for the tech stack, which typically includes languages, frameworks, and tools. Hmm, maybe the function's default is to not include tools, but the user might expect them. However, since the function's parameters are as specified, I should stick to the given defaults unless the user specifies otherwise. \n\nSince the user didn't mention including tools, I'll proceed with the default.

The user mentioned \"intermediate priced,\" which matches the price_range enum's \"moderate\" option. The location is New York, but the format should be \"City, State\". Wait, the user just said New York. Do I need to specify the state? The function's location parameter says \"City, State\" with state abbreviated.

Wait, the function's required fields are category and location. The user didn't specify a category, so perhaps I need to assume a category? But the user's query doesn't mention any specific type of restaurant. Hmm, maybe the user is okay with any category as long as price is moderate and has outdoor seating. But the function requires a category. Wait, the parameters for FindRestaurants have category as required. So I need to pick a category. But the user didn't specify. Maybe the function allows a default? No, the category is in the enum, and there's no default mentioned. So perhaps the user's query is missing the category.

So both are required. Therefore, the user's query is missing the category. But the user didn't specify. So maybe I need to proceed with a default category? But the function's parameters don't have a default for category. So this is a problem. Wait, the user might have intended to leave the category unspecified, but the function requires it.

Then, for each movie, get the show times. \n\nSo, first call Movies_1_FindMovies with location \"Danville, CA\", theater_name \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", genre (maybe not specified), show_type \"imax\". Then, once the movies are found, use the movie names to call GetTimesForMovie for each. \n\nBut the user's question is to find out what's on, so the assistant needs to first find the movies available, then get their times. \n\nSo, the first function call would be Movies_1_FindMovies with location \"Danville, CA\", theater_name \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type \"imax\". \n\nBut the parameters for Movies_1_FindMovies are location (required), theater_name (default 'dontcare'), genre (default 'dontcare'), show_type (default 'dontcare'). So, the user is asking for Imax, so set show_type to 'imax'. \n\nTherefore, the first function call is Movies_1_FindMovies with location \"Danville, CA\", theater_name \"Century Blackhawk Plaza\", show_type \"imax\". \n\nThen, once the movies are found, for each movie, call GetTimesForMovie with movie_name, location, show_date (which the user hasn't provided, but maybe the current date). However, the user hasn't provided a date, so perhaps the assistant needs to ask for it. But according to the problem statement, if parameters are missing, point it out. \n\nBut the user's question is to find out what's on, which might imply the current day. However, the function requires show_date. Therefore, the assistant might need to call the function with the current date. But since the assistant can't know the current date, it's not possible. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the show_date is required. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date, so the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct answer is to point out that the show_date is missing. However, the user might be expecting the current day's showtimes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can assume the current date. But since the assistant doesn't have access to the current date, it's not possible. Therefore, the assistant should inform the user that the show_date is required. \n\nBut the user's question is to find out what's on, so maybe the assistant should first find the movies and then get the times. However, the GetTimesForMovie requires the show_date. Therefore, the assistant needs to first find the movies, then for each, get the times. But without the date, the times can't be retrieved. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should first call Movies_1_FindMovies to get the list of movies, then ask the user for the date. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should make function calls if possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call Movies_1_GetTimesForMovie with the current date. But since the current date is not known, the assistant can't. Therefore, the assistant should point out that the show_date is required. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the date.

But the user specifically said \"similar to those on the album\", so maybe the album parameter is the key here. The function's description says it finds songs aligning with the user's preferences based on those criteria. So providing the album and year should work.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The year is '2017' as per the enum, which includes '2017' and 'dontcare'. So the function call should include album: 'The New Classic', year: '2017', and the others as default. That should cover the user's request."}

First, I need to figure out which functions to use.\n\nLooking at the available functions, Music_3_LookupMusic can search for songs based on genre and year. The user specified Hillbilly style, which is a genre. The year is 2019. The album name might not be necessary here since the user is looking for songs in that genre and year. But wait, they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\" specifically. Maybe I should check if that album is in the search results. However, the LookupMusic function allows filtering by artist, album, genre, and year. The user didn't mention an artist, so maybe leave that as default. \n\nSo, using Music_3_LookupMusic with genre set to 'Hillbilly' and year '2019'. Wait, but the genre enum in the function includes 'Hillbilly'? Let me check. The enum for genre in Music_3_LookupMusic is ['Reggae', 'Holiday', 'Electropop', 'Pop', 'Asia', 'House', 'Electronica', 'Funk', 'Rock', 'Metal', 'Dubstep', 'Country', 'dontcare']. Hmm, Hillbilly isn't listed here. The closest might be 'Country', but that's not exactly Hillbilly. The user might be referring to a sub-genre or a specific style not listed. Since the function's genre enum doesn't include Hillbilly, maybe I should use 'Country' as the genre. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, but I have to work with the given options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's mention of \"Hillbilly style\" is a typo or alternative term. Since 'Country' is present, perhaps that's the best fit. But the user specifically said Hillbilly. Wait, maybe the function's genre list is incomplete. But according to the given data, Hillbilly isn't an option. So perhaps the user's request can't be fully met with the available genres. However, the user also mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\". Maybe the album is part of the search. So, using the LookupMusic function with album set to 'Gotta Be Me', genre as 'Hillbilly' (even though it's not in the enum), but since the enum doesn't have it, maybe the function will ignore it. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'Country' as the genre. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with a Country-style song from 2019. But the user specifically said Hillbilly. Since the function's genre doesn't include Hillbilly, perhaps the best approach is to use the available options. Maybe the user's mention of Hillbilly is a mistake, or perhaps the function's genre list is missing it. But given the constraints, I have to proceed with the available genres. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific artist or album. Since they mentioned the album \"Gotta Be Me\", maybe using the LookupMusic function with album set to that and genre as 'Hillbilly' (even if it's not in the enum). But the function's parameters for genre have an enum, so if Hillbilly isn't there, it might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with a Country genre. So, using genre 'Country' and year 2019, and album 'Gotta Be Me'. That might be the best approach. \n\nSo, the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with parameters: genre 'Country', year '2019', album 'Gotta Be Me'. But the user said Hillbilly, which isn't in the enum. Maybe the user is mistaken, but the function can't handle that. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different genre. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to play the album \"Gotta Be Me\" which is from 2019, so using Music_3_PlayMedia with track from that album. But the user hasn't specified a track title. So, perhaps first use LookupMusic to find songs in the album \"Gotta Be Me\" from 2019, then play them. \n\nBut the user's main request is to hear a song in Hillbilly style from 2019, and the album Gotta Be Me is good. So, maybe first use LookupMusic to find songs in the album \"Gotta Be Me\" that are from 2019, and then play them. \n\nBut the parameters for LookupMusic include album, so setting album to 'Gotta Be Me', genre to 'Hillbilly' (even though it's not in the enum), and year 2019. However, since the genre is not in the enum, the function might not recognize it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with using 'Country' as the genre. So, the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019', album 'Gotta Be Me'. \n\nBut the user specifically said Hillbilly. Since the function's genre doesn't include that, maybe the assistant should point out that the genre isn't available. However, the user might not know that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed with the available options. So, the function call would be to Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019', album 'Gotta Be Me'. \n\nThen, once the songs are found, the assistant can use Music_3_PlayMedia to play them. But the user hasn't specified a track title, so maybe the assistant needs to first find the songs and then play them. \n\nBut the user's message is to \"hear a song\", so maybe the assistant should first look up the songs and then play them. \n\nSo, first, call Music_3_LookupMusic with genre 'Country', year '2019', album 'Gotta Be Me'. Then, if there are results, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track from that album. \n\nBut the user might not have specified a track, so maybe the assistant needs to find the track first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can directly play the album. But the PlayMedia function requires a track title. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\n1. Use Music_3_LookupMusic to find songs in the album \"Gotta Be Me\" from 2019, genre Hillbilly (but since it's not in the enum, maybe use 'Country'). \n\n2. Once the songs are found, use Music_3_PlayMedia with the track from that album. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided a track title, so the assistant might need to use the album name in the PlayMedia function. However, the PlayMedia function requires a track title. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the album name as part of the parameters, but the function doesn't accept album in PlayMedia. The PlayMedia function has parameters track, artist, device, album. So, the assistant can specify the album as 'Gotta Be Me' and the track as the song found. \n\nBut the user hasn't specified a track, so maybe the assistant needs to first find the track. \n\nSo, the first step is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'Gotta Be Me', year '2019', and genre 'Hillbilly' (even though it's not in the enum). \n\nBut since the genre is not in the enum, the function might not return any results. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant can use the genre 'Country' and see if that's acceptable. \n\nSo, the function call would be Music_3_LookupMusic with parameters: artist 'dontcare', album 'Gotta Be Me', genre 'Country', year '2019'. \n\nThen, if that returns songs, the assistant can play them. \n\nBut the user specifically mentioned Hillbilly, which isn't in the enum. So, maybe the assistant should inform the user that the genre isn't available. However, the user might not know that. \n\nAlternatively, proceed with the available options. \n\nSo, the assistant should make the function call to Music_3_LookupMusic with the given parameters. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is Music_3_LookupMusic with album 'Gotta Be Me', genre 'Country', year '2019'. \n\nBut the user said Hillbilly, which is not in the enum. So, maybe the assistant should use the closest available genre. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might not have the correct genre, but the user's request can't be fully met. However, the assistant should try to use the available functions. \n\nSo, the final answer is to call Music_3_LookupMusic with the parameters as per the user's mention of the album and year, and the genre as 'Country' (closest to Hillbilly)."}

But I have to work with the given info. So I'll proceed with the date_of_journey as May 15, 2023, and the journey_start_time as, say, 10:00 AM. But the user didn't specify the time, so maybe I need to check if the function requires it. The Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function requires journey_start_time as a parameter. The user didn't specify the time, so maybe I need to ask for clarification. However, the user's question is to book the tickets, so perhaps they have a specific time in mind. But since they didn't provide it, maybe the function can be called with a default or a placeholder. Wait, the parameters for Trains_1_GetTrainTickets require journey_start_time.

Therefore, the user's question is missing the journey_start_time parameter. However, the user might have intended to provide it, but perhaps they didn't. In that case, the function call cannot be made because the required parameter is missing.

However, the user might have intended to provide it, but it's not clear. \n\nIn this case, the correct approach is to call the Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function with the available parameters, but since the journey_start_time is required, and the user didn't provide it, the function call cannot be made. However, the user might have intended to provide the time, but it's not clear. Therefore, the answer would be to point out that the journey_start_time is missing.

Therefore, this is a problem. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's question is missing the journey_start_time parameter, which is required by the Trains_1_GetTrainTickets function. Therefore, the function call cannot be made. However, the user might have intended to provide the time, but it's not clear. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the journey_start_time is required but not provided."}

Therefore, the assistant should call both functions with the user_id and include_expired=True. However, the user's user ID is \"user123\", which is a string. So the parameters are correct. Therefore, the correct function calls are to call both functions with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=True. But the user might not have shareable tokens. But the question is to remind them of all API tokens, so it's better to call both functions. However, the user might not have shareable tokens. But the functions are separate. So the assistant should call both functions. Therefore, the answer would be to call get_api_tokens and get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id \"user123\" and include_expired=True."}

The user wants to set up a new global application alert configuration. The name is 'UrgentAlert77f7', alert type is error rate, threshold is 5%, and recipients are the two emails provided.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are create_global_application_alert_config, enable_global_application_alert_config, and create_mobile_app_alert_config. Since the user is asking for a global application alert, the create_global_application_alert_config is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for that function: name, alert_type, threshold, recipients. The user provided all these except maybe the enabled flag, which has a default of True. So I can include the required parameters. The alert_type should be 'error_rate' as per the enum. Threshold is 5%, which is a float, so 0.05. Recipients are an array of the two emails.\n\nWait, the threshold in the global function is a float, so 5% would be 0.05. The user said 5%, so that's correct. The recipients are listed as two emails, so the array should have both. The name is given as 'UrgentAlert77f7'. \n\nSo the function call should be create_global_application_alert_config with those parameters. The other functions aren't needed here because the user isn't enabling an existing config or creating a mobile app one. So just one tool call needed here."}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens function. It requires a user_id and an include_revoked boolean. The user didn't mention anything about revoked tokens, so maybe default to False. But the user wants all tokens, which might include revoked ones. Wait, but the function's description says it retrieves shareable tokens. Maybe that's a specific type. However, the user just says \"all API tokens,\" so maybe the other function is better.\n\nLooking at api_token_api.APITokenApi.get_api_tokens. It has parameters like include_expired, page, page_size. The user wants all tokens, so maybe set include_expired to True? But the default for include_expired is False. However, the user might not know about expired vs revoked. The problem is, the functions might be different. The first function is for shareable tokens, the second for all tokens. The user says \"all API tokens,\" so maybe the second function is the right one. But the parameters for that function include include_expired, which is about expired tokens, not revoked. The first function's include_revoked is about revoked tokens. \n\nThe user's request is to get all API tokens. The second function's get_api_tokens might not include revoked tokens by default. But the user might need all, including revoked. However, the first function's get_shareable_api_tokens might not be the same as all tokens. Wait, the first function is called get_shareable_api_tokens, which might be a subset. The second function is get_api_tokens, which might be the main list. \n\nBut the user's user ID is 12345. The first function requires user_id, which is provided. The second function's get_api_tokens doesn't require any parameters, but has optional ones. However, the user might need to use the first function to get the shareable tokens, but the user says \"all API tokens,\" which might be the second function. But the second function's parameters don't include user_id. Wait, the second function's get_api_tokens is part of APITokenApi, which might be for the user's own tokens. But how is the user authenticated? The parameters for the second function don't include user_id, but the first function does. \n\nWait, the first function is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens, which requires user_id. The second function is APITokenApi.get_api_tokens, which doesn't require any parameters. But how does it know which user's tokens to retrieve? Maybe the API is designed such that the user is already authenticated, so the function doesn't need the user_id. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the first function is the correct one to use here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for all tokens, including those that are expired or revoked. The first function's include_revoked parameter is a boolean. The user didn't specify, but the default is False. However, the user says \"all API tokens,\" which might mean including revoked ones. But the first function is for shareable tokens, which might not be the same as all tokens. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's main request is to get all API tokens. The first function is for shareable tokens, which might be a subset. The second function is for getting all tokens, but how is the user authenticated? Since the user provided their user ID, maybe the first function is the right one. But the second function's get_api_tokens doesn't take user_id as a parameter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function is for the current user's tokens, and the user ID is not needed because the API is already authenticated. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the first function is the correct one. \n\nIn this case, the user's user ID is 12345, so the first function is the one to call. The parameters are user_id: 12345 and include_revoked: False (default). But the user wants all tokens, which might include revoked ones. However, the function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not be the same as all tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second function is the correct one. But the second function's parameters don't include user_id. So perhaps the user is authenticated, and the function doesn't need the user_id. But the user provided their user ID, so maybe the first function is the right one. \n\nSo, the correct function to call is CustomDashboardsApi.get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked set to False. But the user might need all tokens, which could include revoked ones. However, the function's description says \"shareable API tokens,\" which might not be the same as all tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the second function, but without user_id, it's unclear. But the user provided their user ID, so the first function is the one to use. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be to get_shareable_api_tokens with user_id 12345 and include_revoked as default False. But the user might need all tokens, which could be different. However, based on the given functions, that's the only one that takes user_id. So I'll proceed with that."}

The first one seems to retrieve detailed info about specific experiences or education, while the second gives a list of experiences and education. The user is asking for specific education details, so maybe 'detail_experience_and_education' is the right choice. \n\nThe parameters for 'detail_experience_and_education' require the type of experience or education. The enum includes 'Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)', which matches the user's query. So I should set the experience_or_education_type to that value. The parameter 'experience_or_education_name' is optional and defaults to 'Not specified', but the user didn't mention a specific name, so maybe leave it as default. \n\nWait, the function's description says it retrieves detailed information about a specific category.

They asked to set a reminder for 7:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to check which functions are available. There's set_alarm and set_countdown. The set_alarm function is for setting an alarm with a specific time, which fits the user's request. The parameters required are alarm_time and purpose. The user specified the time as 7:00 AM, which can be in 12-hour format with AM/PM. The date is December 1, 2023, so the alarm_time should include that. The purpose is to wake up for a meeting.\n\nSo, the alarm_time should be '2023-12-01 07:00:00' in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. The purpose is 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The function allows the purpose to be optional, but since the user mentioned a meeting, it's better to specify it. \n\nWait, the user said \"set a reminder for 7:00 AM\". But the set_alarm function is for alarms, not reminders. However, the purpose parameter in set_alarm can be used to indicate the reason. The user might be using the term 'reminder' interchangeably with alarm here. But according to the function description, set_alarm is for setting an alarm, and set_countdown is for a timer. Since the user wants an alarm to wake up, set_alarm is the right choice.\n\nSo, the correct function call is set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up for meeting'. But the user didn't mention the date in the query, but they said \"tomorro 2023-12-1\" which is a typo for tomorrow. Wait, the user wrote \"tomorro 2023-12-1\". That's a typo, probably meant \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\". But December 1, 2023 is a specific date. However, if today's date is December 1, 2023, then tomorrow would be December 2. But the user might have made a mistake. However, the user explicitly mentioned the date as 2023-12-1, so we should use that. So the alarm is set for 2023-12-01 at 7:00 AM. Wait, but if the user says \"tomorrow 2023-12-1\", that's conflicting. Maybe they meant that the meeting is on December 1, 2023, which is tomorrow. But regardless, the user provided the date as 2023-12-1, so we should use that. So the alarm_time is '2023-12-01 07:00:00'.\n\nTherefore, the function call is set_alarm with alarm_time as '2023-12-01 07:00:00' and purpose as 'wake up for meeting'. Alternatively, the purpose could be 'meeting' or 'wake up'. The default is 'reminder', but since the user specified the purpose, it's better to set it to 'wake up' or 'meeting'. The user's question says \"set a reminder for 7:00 AM\", but the function is for alarms. However, the user might be using the term 'reminder' to mean an alarm. So the correct function is set_alarm with the given time and purpose."}
