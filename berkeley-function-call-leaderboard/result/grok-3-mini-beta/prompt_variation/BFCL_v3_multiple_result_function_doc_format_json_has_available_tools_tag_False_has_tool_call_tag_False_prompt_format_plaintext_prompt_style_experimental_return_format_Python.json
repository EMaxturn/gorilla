The art_form parameter is described as \"The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture.\" It doesn't specify subgenres, so I'll assume \"sculpture\" is sufficient.\n\nAfter this call, I think that's all that's needed for this query. The system will handle the response.\n\nMy response should only be the function call, in the specified format.\n\nFormat: [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nSo, for this: [find_exhibition(location=\"New York, NY\", art_form=\"sculpture\", user_ratings=\"high\")]\n\nYes."}

Looking at the available functions, there's one called 'book_hotel' that matches this.\n\nLet me check the description: \"Book a room in a specific hotel with particular preferences.\"\n\nThe parameters for 'book_hotel' are:\n\n- hotel_name: string, required\n\n- location: string, required\n\n- room_type: string, required\n\n- start_date: string, in format MM-DD-YYYY, required\n\n- stay_duration: integer, required\n\n- view: string, optional, with a default of 'No preference'\n\nFrom the user's query:\n\n- Hotel name: Hotel Paradise\n\n- Location: Las Vegas\n\n- Room type: luxury room (I need to interpret this as the room_type)\n\n- Start date: May 12, 2022, which should be formatted as 05-12-2022 (MM-DD-YYYY)\n\n- Stay duration: 3 days\n\n- View: city view\n\nAll required parameters are present in the query.\n\nSo, I can map:\n\n- hotel_name: \"Hotel Paradise\"\n\n- location: \"Las Vegas\"\n\n- room_type: \"luxury room\" (I'll use that directly)\n\n- start_date: \"05-12-2022\" (converting May 12 to MM-DD-YYYY)\n\n- stay_duration: 3\n\n- view: \"city view\"\n\nThe function call should be in the format: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]\n\nI need to return only the function call, nothing else.\n\nSince this seems to fully address the user's request, I don't need to generate more calls.\n\nFinally, output: [book_hotel(hotel_name=\"Hotel Paradise\", location=\"Las Vegas\", room_type=\"luxury room\", start_date=\"05-12-2022\", stay_duration=3, view=\"city view\")]\n\nMake sure the date is correctly formatted: May is 05, day 12, year 2022, so yes, \"05-12-2022\"."}
