We must represent the array as a string? But the type for conditions is array. How to represent an array in XML?\n\n But the instruction says: the type fields of the parameters must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\n\n We are going to represent the conditions as an array. But how to encode an array in XML? We can use JSON string representation for complex types? \n Actually, the system that processes the function call might expect a JSON string for complex types? But the type is specified as array.\n\n Alternatively, the tool might be designed to parse the XML and then parse the content of the array. However, the problem does not specify the exact serialization.\n\n Since the problem says the function is in Python 3 syntax, and we are to output in the given XML format, we have to represent the array as a string that can be parsed.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You should only return the function calls in your response\" and in the specified XML format.\n\n How about we represent the array as a JSON string? But the type is array, not string. So we cannot.\n\n Alternatively, the system might allow nested XML? But the function definition does not specify a nested structure.\n\n Let me re-read the function parameters:\n\n   \"conditions\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"dict\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"field\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"operation\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": ...},\n          \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [...]\n      }\n   }\n\n How can we represent an array of dicts in XML? We can use nested XML elements? But the problem does not specify that.\n\n Since the problem says to use the type as one of the basic types (including array, dict, tuple) and we are to put the value in the XML, I think we have to represent the array as a string in a format that the backend can parse (like JSON). But note: the type is array, so the backend expects an array. However, in the XML, we can only put a string. Therefore, we might have to use a JSON string.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might expect the array to be represented as a string in JSON format? But the function definition does not specify that.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the system expects the value of the conditions parameter to be a JSON string representing the array. But note: the type is array, not string. So this might be inconsistent.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have a different way. Let me think: the function call format is fixed. We are to put the value as the content of the <param> tag. For an array, we can represent it as a JSON array.\n\n So I will do:\n\n   <param name=\"conditions\" type=\"array\">[{\"field\": \"age\", \"operation\": \">\", \"value\": \"25\"}, {\"field\": \"job\", \"operation\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}]</param>\n\n But note: the type is array, so we are setting the type=\"array\", and then the content is a string that represents the array in JSON.\n\n However, the problem says the type of the parameter must be one of the listed, and we are using type=\"array\", which is allowed.\n\n But wait: the function definition says the conditions is an array of dicts. So we are representing it as a string that is a JSON array. The backend will parse it.\n\n Alternatively, if the backend expects an actual array and not a string, then we cannot represent it as a string. This is a problem.\n\n Given the constraints of the XML format, we have to represent the array as a string. Therefore, we use a JSON string.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might allow a nested representation? But the example format does not show nested parameters.\n\n Since the instruction does not specify how to represent complex types, and we are to use the types (array, dict, tuple) in the type field, I will represent the array as a JSON string and set the type to array. The backend will have to parse it.\n\n However, note: the problem says the function is in Python 3 syntax. In Python, we would pass a list. But in the XML, we have to pass a string. So we are effectively serializing the array.\n\n Alternatively, the system might have a way to represent nested structures? But the example format does not show any.\n\n Considering the above, I will represent the conditions as a JSON string and set the type to array? Or should I set the type to string? That would be incorrect because the function expects an array.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple\". So we set the type to \"array\", but the content of the XML tag is a string that represents the array? How?\n\n Alternatively, we might break the conditions into nested XML? But the function call format does not allow that.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I think the intended way is to use a JSON string for the array and set the type to \"array\", and the backend will parse it.\n\n However, note: the problem says the function is in Python 3 syntax. So the backend might be able to parse a Python literal? But to be safe, we use JSON.\n\n But the problem does not specify the serialization. Therefore, I will follow the common practice and use JSON.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have a different function call mechanism? But we are constrained by the XML format.\n\n I will output:\n\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"database.query\">\n         <param name=\"table\" type=\"string\">user</param>\n         <param name=\"conditions\" type=\"array\">[{\"field\": \"age\", \"operation\": \">\", \"value\": \"25\"}, {\"field\": \"job\", \"operation\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}]</param>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n\n However, note: the value for age condition is a number in the condition, but the function expects the value to be a string? The function definition says the value in the condition is of type string. So we are passing \"25\" as string, which is correct.\n\n But in the JSON, we have to represent the string with quotes. So we have to escape the quotes? Actually, we are writing XML, so we can use CDATA? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can write without escaping? But the double quotes inside the string might break the XML.\n\n We can use single quotes for the JSON string? But the JSON standard requires double quotes.\n\n Therefore, we must escape the inner double quotes? But the XML attribute value is not being used for the content? The content of the <param> tag is text. We can use:\n\n   <param name=\"conditions\" type=\"array\">[{&quot;field&quot;: &quot;age&quot;, &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;25&quot;}, {&quot;field&quot;: &quot;job&quot;, &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;=&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;engineer&quot;}]</param>\n\n Alternatively, we can use a CDATA section to avoid escaping:\n\n   <param name=\"conditions\" type=\"array\"><![CDATA[[{\"field\": \"age\", \"operation\": \">\", \"value\": \"25\"}, {\"field\": \"job\", \"operation\": \"=\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}]]]></param>\n\n But the problem does not specify whether CDATA is allowed.\n\n Since the problem says \"You should only return the function calls in your response\", and does not specify the inner details, I will use the escaped version to be safe in XML.\n\n However, note: the problem says the function call format must be exactly as shown. The example did not have any nested structures, so we don't have an example.\n\n But I think using JSON without escaping might break the XML. So we escape.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON? But that is invalid JSON.\n\n Therefore, I will use the escaped double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the array as a string without quotes? But that would not be valid.\n\n Considering the above, I decide to use:\n\n   [{\\\"field\\\": \\\"age\\\", \\\"operation\\\": \\\">\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"25\\\"}, {\\\"field\\\": \\\"job\\\", \\\"operation\\\": \\\"=\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"engineer\\\"}]\n\n But note: the entire conditions array is represented as a string? Then the backend must parse it as JSON.\n\n Alternatively, the system might have a built-in way to represent arrays? But we are not instructed on that.\n\n I think this is acceptable.\n\n However, note that the function expects the value to be a string. For the age, we are passing a string \"25\", which is correct per the function definition.\n\n But in the database, the age might be an integer. The function does not do type conversion. However, that is beyond our control.\n\n Let's write the function call accordingly."}

Let me check the function definition: \n   enum: ['tolls', 'highways', 'ferries'] -> so it is 'highways'\n\n So we use:\n   avoid: ['highways', 'tolls']\n\n However, note that the function's default avoid is ['highways', 'ferries'] but we are overriding it with the user's request.\n\n Since the function has the avoid parameter as optional, we can include it to override the default.\n\n Therefore, we can make the function call as:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"map_service.get_directions\">\n     <param name=\"start\" type=\"string\">New York</param>\n     <param name=\"end\" type=\"string\">Los Angeles</param>\n     <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">\n        We need to represent the array. Since the type is array of strings, we can write each element as a string.\n        But note: the format requires each parameter to have a type. However, the array itself is a parameter and we must represent the array.\n\n How to represent an array in the XML? We can do:\n\n     <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">\n        <item type=\"string\">highways</item>\n        <item type=\"string\">tolls</item>\n     </param>\n\n But wait, the function definition says the array items are of type string and the enum, so we use the exact strings.\n\n Alternatively, the specification does not explicitly say how to represent array items, but the example format does not show arrays. \n However, the instruction says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\n And for an array, we must represent it. Since the format is XML, we can represent an array by having multiple <item> tags inside the parameter.\n\n But note: the example format in the instruction does not show an example for array. However, the instruction says to use the format:\n\n   <functions>\n     <function name=\"func_name1\">\n        <param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n        ... \n     </function>\n   </functions>\n\n For an array, we can represent it as:\n\n   <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">\n      <value type=\"string\">highways</value>\n      <value type=\"string\">tolls</value>\n   </param>\n\n However, the instruction does not specify the exact inner structure. But since the type is array, and we are to represent the value, we can use:\n\n   Alternatively, we might represent the array as a string? But that would be incorrect.\n\n Let me look at the instruction: it says the type must be one of the types. So we set type=\"array\", and then we need to represent the array.\n\n How about we use a JSON-like representation? But the instruction says to use XML.\n\n Since the instruction does not specify the exact way to represent arrays, and to be safe, we can represent the array as a string in JSON format? \n But the instruction says the type must be array, so we should not use a string.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will follow a common practice in XML for arrays: using multiple elements.\n\n But note: the system that parses this might expect a specific format. The instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of ...\".\n\n Since the example does not show an array, and the instruction does not specify, we must assume that the system can parse an array represented as:\n\n   <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">\n      <item type=\"string\">highways</item>\n      <item type=\"string\">tolls</item>\n   </param>\n\n Alternatively, we might use:\n\n   <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">[\"highways\", \"tolls\"]</param>\n\n But that would be a string representation and the type would be array? The content is a string.\n\n This is ambiguous. However, the function expects an array. We must represent it as an array.\n\n Since the instruction does not specify, I will use the following representation:\n\n   <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">\n      <item type=\"string\">highways</item>\n      <item type=\"string\">tolls</item>\n   </param>\n\n But note: the function definition says the array items are of type string and from the enum. We are using the correct strings.\n\n Alternatively, the instruction might expect a string representation? Let me think.\n\n However, the function parameters in the definition are given with type 'array'. So we must set the type to array and then represent the array.\n\n I will use the above representation with <item> tags.\n\n Alternatively, if the system expects a different representation, it might fail. But the instruction says to use the type \"array\", so we do.\n\n Now, let's write the function call:\n\n <functions>\n   <function name=\"map_service.get_directions\">\n     <param name=\"start\" type=\"string\">New York</param>\n     <param name=\"end\" type=\"string\">Los Angeles</param>\n     <param name=\"avoid\" type=\"array\">\n        <item type=\"string\">highways</item>\n        <item type=\"string\">tolls</item>\n     </param>\n   </function>\n </functions>\n\n However, note: the function's avoid parameter is optional. We are including it because the user specifically requested avoiding highways and tolls.\n\n Also note: the function does not require the avoid parameter, so we are allowed to omit it? But we are including it because of the user request.\n\n We are including it to override the default.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n\n But wait: the function definition says the default avoid is ['highways', 'ferries']? Actually, the function definition says: \"Default is ['highways', 'ferries']\". \n However, the user does not want highways and tolls. They didn't say anything about ferries. But they did say \"avoiding highways and toll roads\", so we should avoid only those two? \n And let the default for ferries be? Actually, we are setting avoid to ['highways','tolls'], so we are overriding the default. That means ferries are not avoided? \n\n But the user did not mention ferries. So we are following the user's request exactly: avoid highways and tolls. \n\n So the above call is correct.\n\n Let me double-check the function parameters:\n   Required: start, end.\n   Optional: avoid.\n\n We are providing all required and the optional that the user specified.\n\n Therefore, we return the function call as above."}

However, the user's question directly asks for the law, so we can try with the common title of the law or the book.\n   - location (optional, string): not provided, so we can omit or set to default.\n\n Since the function requires the work_title, we must provide a string for that. The exact title of the work is \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", but the law is contained in that work. However, the function might expect the book title. Alternatively, the work_title could be the common name of the law? But note the function's description: it says \"Title of the scientific work\". The work is the book.\n\n But note: the user asks for the law. However, the law was first published in the book. So we can use the book title.\n\n However, the user might not know the exact book title? But we are instructed to use the function with the parameters we have.\n\n We have:\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: We can try \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" or the common abbreviation \"Principia\". But note the function might require the full title? We don't have that information. Alternatively, we can also try the common name: \"law of universal gravitation\" might not be the title of a book.\n\n Since the function is designed to find the publication year of a scientific work, and the work is a book, we should use the book title.\n\n But what if the function doesn't recognize the book by its full title? We don't know the underlying data. We must use the most common and recognizable title.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the law was published in 1687. However, we are not to use prior knowledge, but the function.\n\n So, we will call the function with:\n   author: \"Isaac Newton\"\n   work_title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n\n But note: the function has an optional parameter 'location'. We don't have that information, so we can skip it (the function will default to 'all').\n\n However, the user's question does not specify the location. So we can omit it.\n\n Therefore, we make the function call:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <param name=\"author\" type=\"string\">Isaac Newton</param>\n    <param name=\"work_title\" type=\"string\">Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the function might not have data for the full Latin title? We can also try the common abbreviation.\n\n Alternatively, we might try both? However, we are only allowed to make one call per function at a time? The instructions don't say we can make multiple calls for the same function in one response, but the format allows multiple function calls. However, we are only trying to get one answer.\n\n We have to make a decision: use the most common and full title.\n\n However, the user said \"law of universal gravitation\", which is not a book title. We are making an inference that the work in question is the Principia. This is common knowledge.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the common name of the law? But note the function expects a work title. The law itself is not a separate publication but part of the book.\n\n So we stick with the book title.\n\n But note: the function might not have an entry for the full Latin title? We can try the English translation? But the original was in Latin.\n\n We are not sure. We must try.\n\n However, the function might be designed to handle common titles. We can try with the abbreviation:\n\n   work_title: \"Principia\"\n\n But let's stick to the full title as it is the official title.\n\n Alternatively, we can make two calls? The problem says we can output multiple function calls. We can try both?\n\n The format allows multiple function elements inside the <functions> tag.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\" So if we are uncertain about the exact title, we can try multiple.\n\n But note: the function might return multiple results? We don't know. The function specification doesn't say. But it says it returns the year, so we assume one result per call.\n\n We can try:\n\n   Call 1: work_title = \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n   Call 2: work_title = \"Principia\"\n\n However, the problem does not specify that we can make multiple calls for the same function. But the format allows it.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose the most common one. Since the user mentioned \"law of universal gravitation\", we can also try to use that as the work_title? But that would be against the function's requirement (which expects the title of the scientific work). The law is not the work, the book is.\n\n So we decide to try with two different book titles:\n\n   Option 1: Full title: \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n   Option 2: Abbreviated: \"Principia\"\n\n We make two function calls:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <param name=\"author\" type=\"string\">Isaac Newton</param>\n    <param name=\"work_title\" type=\"string\">Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <param name=\"author\" type=\"string\">Isaac Newton</param>\n    <param name=\"work_title\" type=\"string\">Principia</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the function might not be case-sensitive? We don't know. We use the standard capitalization.\n\n However, the function might be designed to be flexible. We try with the standard.\n\n Alternatively, we can try one call and if it fails, then we try the other? But we are required to output all function calls in one response.\n\n We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one response.\n\n So we output both.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" We have the required parameters.\n\n Therefore, we make two function calls.\n\n But note: the user might have meant a different work? We are doing our best.\n\n Alternatively, we can also try the English translation? The book is sometimes referred to as \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\". But we don't know the function's data.\n\n We are limited by the information we have. We try the two most common: the full Latin and the abbreviation.\n\n However, to avoid too many calls, we can also note that the common way to refer to the book is \"Principia\". So maybe we only need one call? But we are not sure.\n\n Since we are allowed to make multiple, we do two.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the number of calls we can make. We are to do our best.\n\n Alternatively, we can also try with the common English title? That would be a third call. But we don't want to overdo it.\n\n Given the time, we stick to two.\n\n We choose:\n\n   Call 1: work_title = \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\n   Call 2: work_title = \"Principia\"\n\n We output both.\n\n But note: the function might return the same result for both? That's okay.\n\n However, the function might not have the full title. We hope one of them works.\n\n So we write:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <param name=\"author\" type=\"string\">Isaac Newton</param>\n    <param name=\"work_title\" type=\"string\">Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica</param>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"publication_year.find\">\n    <param name=\"author\" type=\"string\">Isaac Newton</param>\n    <param name=\"work_title\" type=\"string\">Principia</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\n But note: the function also has an optional parameter 'location'.

The user has provided:\n   music.theory.chordProgression(progression=['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'])\n\nBut note that the function in the provided list is named 'music.theory.chordProgression'. Also, the function requires the parameter 'progression' which is provided.\n\nAdditionally, there are two optional parameters: \n   returnAllPossibleKeys (boolean, default false)\n   assumeMajor (boolean, default true)\n\nSince the user did not specify these, we can use the defaults.\n\nHowever, the required output format is XML-like with the function call wrapped in <functions> and each function call in <function> tags with parameters as <param> tags.\n\nWe must convert the function call accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n1. The function name is \"music.theory.chordProgression\".\n2. The progression parameter is an array of strings: ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'].\n3. We are not specifying the optional parameters, so they will take their default values.\n\nBut note: the function specification says the progression is in Roman numerals. The given progression matches.\n\nWe'll create the XML structure accordingly.\n\nNote: The type of the progression parameter is array (of strings). We must represent each element as a string in the array.\n\nHowever, in the XML representation, we have to represent the array by repeating the items. The function specification in the problem does not specify exactly how to represent arrays in the XML, but the example in the function description uses an array. We are to use the type \"array\" for the parameter.\n\nBut looking at the example function call in the problem statement, it uses an array of strings. How do we represent an array in the XML?\n\nThe problem says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nAnd for the array, we have to represent it appropriately. However, the problem does not specify the exact XML representation for arrays. But note that the example function call in the problem (the one that is given as a list) uses a JSON-like array.\n\nBut in the XML format we are required to use, we have to represent each element as a child of the parameter? Or as a single string? \n\nLooking at the example in the problem: \n   <param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">['I','V','vi','IV']</param>\n\nBut that would be a string representation of an array, not a true array. Alternatively, we might represent it as:\n\n   <param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">\n      <item type=\"string\">I</item>\n      <item type=\"string\">V</item>\n      <item type=\"string\">vi</item>\n      <item type=\"string\">IV</item>\n   </param>\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify a nested structure. The example function call in the problem (the one with the user's input) is written as a Python list. But we are to use the XML format as per the instructions.\n\nBut note: the instructions say \"You MUST put it in the format of ...\". And the example in the instructions does not show an array. Therefore, we must follow the pattern of the example.\n\nThe example in the instructions uses:\n   <param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>\n\nSo for an array, we have to represent the entire array as the text content of the param tag? But then how do we represent the type of the items? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect a JSON-like string for the array? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the function expects an array, we can represent the array as a JSON string? But the type is \"array\", so the system might parse it accordingly.\n\nBut note: the function description says the parameter is of type array. So we can represent the array in the XML as a string that is a JSON array? Or as a Python-like array? \n\nLooking back at the user's input: they used a Python-like list: ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'].\n\nBut the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" - but here we have the progression.\n\nGiven the instructions, and to be safe, we can represent the array as a string that is a JSON array. But note the type is \"array\", so the system might expect a native array representation. However, the XML is text.\n\nAlternatively, the system that processes the function calls might be able to parse a string representation of an array. But the problem does not specify.\n\nBut note: the example function call in the problem's function list uses a Python 3 syntax. However, the output format is XML.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will represent the array as a string in the XML, but with the type \"array\". But that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow a nested representation? The instructions do not specify. \n\nBut looking at the example in the problem: \n   The function parameters are given in a JSON format. The progression is an array of strings.\n\nWe must follow the XML format as per the instructions. The instructions do not show an example for an array. So I will use the following:\n\n   <param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">['I','V','vi','IV']</param>\n\nBut note: the array elements are strings, so we must enclose them in quotes. However, the entire value is a string that represents the array.\n\nBut this is ambiguous. Alternatively, we can represent each element separately? But the instructions do not show how.\n\nAfter re-examining the problem statement: it says \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\"\n\nIt does not specify how to represent complex types. Therefore, we must represent the array as a string that can be evaluated? Or as a JSON string?\n\nBut the function is in Python, so we can use a Python-like string representation.\n\nGiven that the user's input is in Python syntax, we can use:\n\n   progression: \"['I','V','vi','IV']\"\n\nBut note: the type is array, so we set type=\"array\", and the content is the string representation.\n\nAlternatively, the system might expect the array to be represented by multiple <item> tags? But the instructions do not specify.\n\nSince the instructions are ambiguous, and to match the user's input format, I will use the string representation of the array.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"music.theory.chordProgression\">\n    <param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">['I','V','vi','IV']</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nBut note: the function also has optional parameters. We are not required to set them because they have defaults. However, the problem does not say we must omit optional parameters. We could include them with the default values? But the user did not specify.\n\nGiven that the user's call did not include them, we can omit them. The function will use the defaults.\n\nAlternatively, we can include them with the default values? The problem does not require either. But to be explicit, we can set them. But the user did not ask for all possible keys and assumed major, so we can leave them out.\n\nSo the final function call is:\n\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"music.theory.chordProgression\">\n    <param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">['I','V','vi','IV']</param>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n\nBut wait: the array in the user's call is exactly: ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'] - note the spaces. But in the string representation we are writing, we have removed the spaces. It doesn't matter? The function should parse it the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without spaces to be consistent with the example in the function description? The function description example: ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'].\n\nBut in XML, the exact string representation should not matter as long as it is valid.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid any parsing issues, we can write it as a JSON array? But the function is in Python.\n\nGiven that the function is in Python, and the input is a string, it will have to be evaluated. But that might be unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, the system might have a way to parse the array without evaluation? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will follow the pattern of the example in the function description: no spaces after the commas.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify. So I'll use: \"['I','V','vi','IV']\"\n\nBut note that the chord 'vi' is in lowercase? That's acceptable as per the example.\n\nTherefore, the final function call in XML format is:"}
