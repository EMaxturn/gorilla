Since they asked for today's movies, I should set the movie_date to today's date in India. The default for movie_date is the current date, but I need to make sure it's set correctly. The function's default is None, but the note says to default to current date. So maybe I don't need to specify movie_date unless I want to override it. Wait, the user didn't mention a specific date, so using the default (today's date) is correct. So the parameters would be city: Mumbai, and movie_date set to today's date. Wait, but the function's default for movie_date is None, but the note says to calculate it as today's date in India. So maybe the function will handle that, but perhaps I should explicitly set it to today's date. However, the user didn't specify a date, so maybe just providing the city is enough, and the function will use the current date. But the function's parameters have a default of None for movie_date, but the description says the default is the current date. Maybe the function's default is already set to current date, so I don't need to include movie_date. But to be safe, maybe include it. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says \"Default is the current date.\" That might be a discrepancy. Hmm. The user is asking for today's movies, so regardless, I should set movie_date to today's date. Let me check the current date in India. Let's assume today is 2023-10-25. So the parameters would be city: Mumbai, movie_date: '2023-10-25'. But since the user didn't specify the date, maybe the function's default is already handling that. However, the note says to consider the movie date as today's date in India. So perhaps the function's default is not set, and I need to explicitly set it. Wait, the parameters for movie_date have a default of None, but the description says the default is the current date. That's conflicting. Maybe the function's default is the current date, so I can omit it. But to ensure it's correct, maybe include it. Alternatively, the function might require the date to be specified. Since the user is asking for today's movies, I should set movie_date to today's date. But how to get today's date? Since the user is in India, I need to use the Indian time zone. Let's assume the current date is 2023-10-25. So the parameters would be city: Mumbai, movie_date: '2023-10-25'. But the user didn't specify the date, so maybe the function's default is already handling that. However, the note says to calculate it as today's date in India. So perhaps the function's default is not set, and I need to include it. But since the user is asking for today's movies, it's better to include the movie_date parameter with today's date. So the function call would be get_movies with city: Mumbai and movie_date: today's date. But since the user didn't specify the date, maybe the function's default is sufficient. However, the note says to consider the movie date as today's date in India, so perhaps the function's default is not set, and I need to include it. This is a bit confusing. To be safe, I'll include the movie_date parameter with today's date. But how to get today's date? Since the user is in India, I need to use the Indian time zone. Let's assume the current date is 2023-10-25. So the parameters would be city: Mumbai, movie_date: '2023-10-25'.

However, the function's parameters have a default of None for movie_date, but the description says the default is the current date. This is conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps the function's default is the current date, so I can omit the movie_date parameter. Therefore, the function call would be get_movies with city: Mumbai.

The function getDataForProfessional can retrieve professionals based on service type, location, availability, and rating. The parameters required are service_id, province_id, and optionally district_name, sub_district_name, rating, etc.\n\nThe service_id for ironing is 2, as per the enum in the function's parameters. The province_id for Chiang Mai is 2. The district_name is Sankampang, and the sub_district_name is Ton Pao. The rating required is 4.5. \n\nWait, the function's parameters have default values for district and sub-district, but the user specified both, so I should include them. The rating is a float, so 4.5 is valid. The other parameters like dates and has_late_check_in aren't mentioned, so they can be left as defaults. \n\nSo the function call should include service_id=2, province_id=2, district_name=\"Sankampang\", sub_district_name=\"Ton Pao\", and rating=4.5.
