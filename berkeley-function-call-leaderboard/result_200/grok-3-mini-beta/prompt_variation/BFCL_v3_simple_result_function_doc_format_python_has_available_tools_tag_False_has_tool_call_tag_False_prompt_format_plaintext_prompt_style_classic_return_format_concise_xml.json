Since it's the default, I can omit it, but to be precise, I'll include it.\n\nThe function description says: status (str): The status of the lawsuit. Default is 'ongoing'. So, if I don't provide it, it will be 'ongoing', which is what we want.\n\nIn the function call format, I should only include the parameters I need. But to make it clear, I can include it.\n\nThe user's request: \"Search for ongoing lawsuits related to the company 'Google' filed after January 1, 2021 in California.\"\n\nSo, mapping:\n\n- company: 'Google'\n\n- start_date: '01-01-2021' (since it's after this date, and the function uses start_date as the beginning of the range)\n\nThe function says: \"Start of the date range for when the lawsuit was filed\". So, for \"filed after January 1, 2021\", start_date should be '01-01-2021', and it will return lawsuits from that date onwards.\n\n- location: 'California'\n\n- status: 'ongoing' (default, but I'll include it for clarity)\n\nI need to format the response as specified: <functions><function name=\"func_name\">...</function></functions>\n\nSo, for this, it would be:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"lawsuit_search\">\n\n<param name=\"company\" type=\"string\">Google</param>\n\n<param name=\"start_date\" type=\"string\">01-01-2021</param>\n\n<param name=\"location\" type=\"string\">California</param>\n\n<param name=\"status\" type=\"string\">ongoing</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nThe types: company is string, start_date is string, location is string, status is string.

This looks like they're trying to call the function directly, but in this system, I need to respond by making function calls in the specified XML-like format.\n\nThe available function is: music.theory.chordProgression\n\nIt takes these parameters:\n\n- progression: a list, e.g., ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV']\n\n- returnAllPossibleKeys: a boolean, default is false\n\n- assumeMajor: a boolean, default is true\n\nIn the user's message, they've specified the progression as ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'], but they haven't specified the other parameters.

The instructions say: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\" So, for a list, I can use \"array\".\n\n- Value: ['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV'] \u2013 I need to represent this as a string or in a way that fits. In the format, it's just <param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV']</param>, but I think I need to serialize it properly. Looking at the example, it's just the value as is.\n\nIn the instructions, it's like <param name=\"param1\" type=\"type1\">value1</param>, so for an array, I can put the list as a string representation.\n\nThe other parameters aren't specified by the user, so I'll use the defaults: returnAllPossibleKeys=false, assumeMajor=true.\n\nThe function description says: \"Default is false\" for returnAllPossibleKeys and \"Default is true\" for assumeMajor. So, I don't have to include them if I'm using the defaults, but to be precise, I should include them to make the call explicit.\n\nThe function call format doesn't specify that I have to include all parameters; I can just include the ones I'm setting.\n\nIn the user's message, they only provided progression, so I'll only set that and let the others default.\n\nTo make a complete call, I should include what's necessary.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" But in this case, the function has defaults, so it's not required.\n\nProgression is required, as it's the first arg, but others have defaults.\n\nSo, I can proceed with just progression.\n\nNow, format it:\n\n<functions>\n\n<function name=\"music.theory.chordProgression\">\n\n<param name=\"progression\" type=\"array\">['I', 'V', 'vi', 'IV']</param>\n\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nIs \"array\" the right type?
