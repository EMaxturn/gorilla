So, foodItem could be \"Caesar salad\", and removeIngredients could be \"anchovies\".\n\nThat fits perfectly.\n\nNext, for the drink: \"update my order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk\".\n\nLooking at the tools:\n\n- ChaDri.change_drink: This is for modifying a drink order. It takes:\n\n  - drink_id (str): The unique identifier of the drink.\n\n  - new_preferences (dict): Updated preferences for the drink.\n\nThe user mentioned \"order 123\", which I assume is the drink_id. So, drink_id = \"123\".\n\nNew preferences: \"a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk\". I need to format this as a dictionary.\n\nPossible keys for the dictionary might include size, type, sweetness level, milk type, etc. Based on common sense:\n\n- Size: large\n\n- Type: hot coffee\n\n- Sweetness: regular\n\n- Milk: almond milk\n\nSo, new_preferences could be something like: {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}\n\nI need to make sure it's a valid dict.\n\nNow, I have to make function calls for both.\n\nThe tool call format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can call multiple functions in one response if needed.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should call both ChaFod and ChaDri.change_drink.\n\nFirst, ChaFod:\n\n- foodItem: \"Caesar salad\"\n\n- removeIngredients: \"anchovies\"\n\n- newIngredients and specialInstructions are not specified, so default to empty.\n\nSecond, ChaDri.change_drink:\n\n- drink_id: \"123\"\n\n- new_preferences: {\"size\": \"large\", \"type\": \"hot coffee\", \"sweetness\": \"regular\", \"milk\": \"almond milk\"}\n\nThe function is named \"ChaDri.change_drink\", which might be a module or class method.

To check the status, the input must include the keyword '\ud655\uc778'.\"\n\nIt specifies 'power on' or 'start' for turning on, but the example given is: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' which means 'Living room, Air conditioner, Execute'.\n\nIn the args: \"Examples: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' for turning on the air conditioner...\"\n\nSo, '\uc2e4\ud589' seems to be used for turning on, even though it says 'power on' or 'start'. Maybe '\uc2e4\ud589' is equivalent.\n\nFor stopping: '\ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\uc2e4, \ud1b5\ub3cc\uc774, \uc911\uc9c0' for stopping the washing machine.\n\nSo, it accepts '\uc911\uc9c0' for stop.\n\nThe function requires the command as a string in the format: room, appliance, command.\n\nThe user has two separate commands in one message. I need to make separate function calls for each.\n\nThe tool call format allows multiple functions in one <TOOLCALL> section, like: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nSo, I can call ControlAppliance.execute twice, once for each command.\n\nFirst command: '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nSecond command: '\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nI need to pass this as the 'command' parameter for each call.\n\nThe function is: ControlAppliance.execute(command=str)\n\nSo, for the first one: command='\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589'\n\nFor the second: command='\uce68\uc2e4, \uacf5\uae30\uccad\uc815\uae30, \uc911\uc9c0'\n\nThat matches the examples.\n\nIs there anything missing?

The human said \"in Celsius\", so I'll use 'celsius' to match common conventions.\n\nIn the function doc, it's not specified exactly, but I'll go with 'celsius'.\n\nNow, structure the response:\n\nOnly include the <TOOLCALL> section with the function calls.\n\nSo, it should be: <TOOLCALL>[get_news_report(location='Paris, France'), get_current_weather(location='Letterkenny, Ireland', unit='celsius')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAfter this, the system will execute these calls, and if needed, I might have more turns, but for now, this fulfills the request.\n\nThe task says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nI've covered both parts, so this should be it for this turn."}

That matches the parameters for both functions.\n\nThe user said \"all clouds,\" but I only have tools for AWS and GCP. I don't have one for Azure or any other cloud.

Add all changed files to Git changes.\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo.\n\nI have the available tools: clone_repo, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, analyse_repo_contents, and push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nLet me map these to the steps:\n\n- Step 1: Clone the repo. I can use the clone_repo function. It requires repo_url, and optionally destination, recursive, and depth.\n\n  - repo_url: 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'\n\n  - I can use default for others.\n\n- Step 2: Analyze the contents. Use analyse_repo_contents. It requires directory_name, which should be the path where the repo is cloned. If I clone to default '.', it might be the current directory, but I need to specify it properly.\n\n- Step 2.1: Create/update Dockerfile. Use create_a_docker_file, which requires directory_name.\n\n- Step 2.2: Create Kubernetes YAML. Use create_kubernetes_yaml_file, which requires directory_name, and other optional params.\n\n- Step 3: Add all changed files. The push_git_changes_to_github function says it will automatically git add all changes, so I can use that for committing and pushing.\n\n- Step 4: Commit and push. Again, push_git_changes_to_github handles committing and pushing.\n\nThe function push_git_changes_to_github will git add all changes, commit, and push. So for steps 3 and 4, I can use that.\n\nI need to sequence these calls properly because some depend on others.\n\nIn a multi-turn conversation, I should make calls one at a time, but the instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to output all necessary function calls in this response if possible.\n\nThe format is to put them in <TOOLCALL> section, like <TOOLCALL>[func1(params), func2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can call multiple functions in one response.\n\nOrder matters:\n\n1. First, clone the repo.\n\n2. Then, analyze the repo.\n\n3. Based on analysis, create Dockerfile.\n\n4. Based on analysis, create Kubernetes YAML.\n\n5. Finally, push changes.\n\nThe functions for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML don't directly take analysis as input; they just need directory_name. I assume that once I call analyse_repo_contents, the system will handle the analysis, and then I can proceed to create the files.\n\nIn the available tools, analyse_repo_contents just analyzes and determines the language, but the other functions don't explicitly use that output. However, the user says \"based on the analysis\", so I'll assume that calling analyse_repo_contents first is necessary.\n\nIn a real system, the analysis might be used implicitly, but for this, I just need to call the functions in sequence.\n\nSo, probable sequence:\n\n- Call clone_repo first.\n\n- Then call analyse_repo_contents.\n\n- Then call create_a_docker_file.\n\n- Then call create_kubernetes_yaml_file.\n\n- Finally, call push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it has parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The user didn't specify, so I can use defaults.\n\nFor push_git_changes_to_github, it needs directory_name, and I can use defaults for commit_message and branch_name.\n\nWhat should be the directory_name? For clone_repo, if I don't specify destination, it's '.'. So, perhaps all subsequent functions can use '.' as directory_name.\n\nTo be precise, let's assume it's cloned to the current directory.\n\nThe user said: \"clone the repo git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\" and then \"analyse the contents of the repo\", so directory_name would be the name of the repo or '.'.\n\nIn clone_repo, the destination defaults to '.', which might not be ideal if there are multiple repos, but for this, I'll use '.'.\n\nIn analyse_repo_contents, it says: \"The name of the directory where the repository is located. This should be a path relative to the root of the repository.\" That might be confusing. Probably, for a cloned repo in '.', it would be '.'.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll use the repo name or '.'.\n\nThe repo URL is 'git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git', so the directory might be 'nodejs-welcome' if cloned to '.'.\n\nIn Git, when you clone, it creates a directory with the repo name unless specified.\n\nIn the function: \"If omitted, the repository is cloned into the current working directory.\" Actually, Git clone usually creates a subdirectory.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume we can use 'nodejs-welcome' as directory_name for subsequent calls.\n\nThe function descriptions don't specify, so I'll use '.' for now.\n\nFor create_a_docker_file, it says: \"The name of the repository directory where the Dockerfile will be created. The directory name should be a valid path relative to the root of the repository.\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Probably, for the cloned repo, if it's in a subdirectory, say 'nodejs-welcome', then directory_name should be 'nodejs-welcome'.\n\nTo be safe, I'll use 'nodejs-welcome' as inferred from the repo URL.\n\nOkay, so in my response, I need to output the TOOLCALL with all these functions in sequence.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // assuming\n\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')  // with defaults\n\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nFor create_kubernetes_yaml_file, it requires directory_name, and others are optional, so okay.\n\nI think that's it."}

It can execute a search query and has an option to filter results from after 2022. The user specified to include only information after 2022, so I can set include_after_year=True. The prompt should be the search query.\n\n- **generate_image**: This seems suitable for the second part. It's for generating a digital image based on a text prompt. The description matches what the user wants.\n\nNow, checking if the functions match exactly:\n\n- For search: The user said \"since October 2021\" but also \"include only information published after the year 2022\". There's a conflict, but they explicitly say \"Include only information published after the year 2022\", so I'll use that. The function has include_after_year which defaults to False, but I can set it to True for after 2022.\n\n- For image: The user described a digital painting, which fits generate_image. There's also generate_human_image, which is specifically for human subjects. The description includes \"a masked woman\", so it could fit either, but generate_human_image is tailored for humans, so that might be more appropriate.\n\nComparing:\n\n- generate_image: General purpose, can generate any image.\n\n- generate_human_image: Specifically for human subjects, and the prompt is about a woman, so this is better.\n\nThe user's description: \"a digital painting of a masked woman...\" \u2013 This is a human subject, so generate_human_image is more precise.\n\nI need to format the tool calls correctly.

Please check for this verbatim.\"\n\nIt seems like they want to search for that exact phrase, but also filter to after 2022.\n\nSo, prompt could be: \"significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021\"\n\nAnd set include_after_year=True, which means after 2022.\n\nFor generate_human_image:\n\n- prompt: The full description provided.\n\n- Other params: Default might be fine, but I can specify if needed.\n\nThe user didn't specify quality or format, so use defaults.\n\nFinally, structure the response: Only the <TOOLCALL> section with the functions.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[search_engine.query(prompt=\"significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021\", include_after_year=True), generate_human_image(prompt=\"a digital painting of a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nOne note: The function generate_human_image's prompt example is 'a smiling girl with blue eyes', so this fits.\n\nAlso, ensure no other text in the response."}

The user says \"regardless\", so I should send the message even if I don't find the birthday.\n\nThe task is to make function calls. I need to chain them if necessary.\n\nIn one turn, I should try to complete as much as possible. So, first, search for the memory, then send the message.\n\nHowever, the system might process one function call at a time. The instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request.\"\n\nBut in the format, I can call multiple functions in one response, like <TOOLCALL>[func1(), func2()]</TOOLCALL>.\n\nI need to call recall_memory_search first to get the info, but then use that info to send a message. The problem is, function calls are sequential, and I can't use the output of one in the same response.\n\nThe user said \"find out... and then congratulate\", but I have to send the message regardless. So, perhaps I can just call the search function and then the send_message function.\n\nFor send_message, I need parameters: message, recipient, urgent.\n\nThe user didn't specify the recipient. In the function description, it's default='default@example.com', but for Shishir, I need to know who that is.\n\nThe question assumes I know or can find out. But in the tools, I don't have a way to directly know recipients.\n\nThis is a problem. The function requires a recipient, and the user didn't specify it. In the human's message, it's \"Shishir's birthday\", so probably Shishir is the recipient.\n\nI need to point out if parameters are missing. The task says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\"\n\nFor send_message, recipient is required, though it has a default. But is 'default@example.com' appropriate? Probably not for Shishir.\n\nIn the function description: \"recipient (str, default='default@example.com')\", so I can omit it and it will use the default, but that might not be correct.\n\nThe user implies Shishir is a known entity, so perhaps I should use 'Shishir' as the recipient.\n\nTo be precise, I should check if I can proceed.\n\nFirst, call recall_memory_search for \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nThen, call send_message with the message 'Happy Birthday!' and recipient as 'Shishir'.\n\nIs 'Shishir' a valid recipient string? It might be, depending on the system.\n\nIf I call recall_memory_search, I might get the birthday, but I can't use that in the same call; I'd have to wait for the response.\n\nThe user wants me to send the message regardless, so I can just send it after searching, or even without.\n\nTo fulfill: Search first, then send.\n\nIn one response, I can list multiple functions.\n\nSo, perhaps: First, recall_memory_search, then send_message.\n\nThe send_message doesn't depend on the search result, per the user's \"regardless\".\n\nThe exact wording: \"find out when Shishir's birthday is from our previous conversations and then congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless?\"\n\nSo, \"regardless\" probably means send the message no matter if I find the birthday or not.\n\nI should still perform the search.\n\nPlan: Call recall_memory_search with query about Shishir's birthday, and then call send_message.\n\nFor recall_memory_search:\n\n- query: Something like \"Shishir's birthday\"\n\n- page: Default 0\n\n- request_heartbeat: Default False, but maybe set to True if I want follow-up, but not necessary.\n\nFor send_message:\n\n- message: \"Happy Birthday!\"\n\n- recipient: \"Shishir\" (assuming that's how it's identified)\n\n- urgent: Default False\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nResponse format: Only <TOOLCALL> with the functions.\n\nSo, I'll output: <TOOLCALL>[recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"Shishir\")]</TOOLCALL>\n\nIs that the exact format? Yes, as per the instructions.\n\nOne potential issue: If the search is needed before sending, but since I can't wait, I'll just call both.\n\nPerhaps the system will execute them in order.\n\nI think that's the best I can do."}

The function description says \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\", so I should pass the larger one as `a`. 48 is larger than 36, so a=48, b=36.\n\n2. \"and then tell me how steep the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 is at x = 5\" \u2013 This is asking for the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at x=5. The steepness of the curve is essentially the slope, which is given by the derivative. I have a function called `estimate_derivative` that can estimate the derivative of a function at a point.\n\nFor the second part, I need to provide the function as a callable object. In this setup, I can't actually define a function here; I just need to call the tool with the appropriate parameters. The function signature expects `function` to be a callable object, but in my response, I have to specify it in the tool call. This might be tricky because I'm not executing code; I'm just invoking the function. I assume that the system will handle providing the actual function.\n\nThe available tools are in Python format, so for `estimate_derivative`, I need to pass `function` as something like a lambda or a defined function, but in the tool call, I might need to represent it as a string or something. Looking back at the tool call format, it says: \"You MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...)]</TOOLCALL>\". I need to figure out how to pass a callable.\n\nIn the function description, it says \"function (any): The mathematical function...\", so perhaps I can pass a string representation, but that's not ideal. For this exercise, I should assume that I can pass it as a lambda function string or something, but the tool call is in a string format anyway.\n\nIn practice, for this simulation, I might need to indicate it as is. But let's check the exact requirement: I have to call the function with the params.\n\nFor `estimate_derivative`, params are:\n\n- function: I need to provide f(x) = x^2. Perhaps as a string 'lambda x: x**2' or something similar.\n\n- x: 5\n\n- dx: default 0.0001, so I can omit if default is fine\n\n- method: default 'central', so omit if fine\n\nThe user asked to do both things in sequence: first find GCD, then find the derivative.\n\nThe instructions say: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSo, I need to make function calls for both parts.\n\nI should call both functions in this response since they are part of the same query.\n\nFinally, once I have no more functions to call, the system will handle it.\n\nIn my response, I need to only include the <TOOLCALL> section with the function calls.\n\nSo, for this, I need to call:\n\n1. math_gcd(a=48, b=36)  // since 48 > 36\n\n2. estimate_derivative(function= something for x**2, x=5)\n\nHow to represent the function? In the tool call, I have to put it as a parameter. Perhaps as a string: function=lambda x: x**2\n\nI think that's acceptable for this context.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[math_gcd(a=48, b=36), estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems right.\n\nOne more thing: the function description for math_gcd says \"a (int): The first and larger non-negative integer\", so yes, a=48, b=36.\n\nFor estimate_derivative, I'm using defaults for dx and method, which is fine."}

The user wants to flip it horizontally, so this matches.\n\n2. **rotateImageAction**: This rotates the image clockwise by a specified degree. The user wants to turn it by 20 degrees, which I assume means rotate by 20 degrees. It accepts an integer for degrees, and 20 is between 0 and 360.\n\nThe user wants to do two things: rotate and flip. So, I might need to call both functions.\n\nThe task says: \"you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.\" And in the multi-turn behavior, I should try to complete the tasks in the current turn.\n\nThese functions seem to operate independently. There's no single function that does both rotation and flipping. So, I should call both.\n\nFor **rotateImageAction**, the required args are:\n\n- degrees (int): 20\n\n- image_format (str, default='JPEG'): I can use the default.\n\n- keep_original (bool, default=True): I can use the default.\n\nThe function description doesn't specify an input image. It just says \"Rotates the image\". But in the context, it might assume there's a current image. However, looking back, none of these functions explicitly take an image path or data as input except for removeBackgroundAction and getRecommendationsAction.\n\nFor rotateImageAction, it doesn't have an image input parameter listed. That might be a problem. Let me double-check:\n\n- flipImageAction: No image input.\n\n- rotateImageAction: No image input.\n\n- removeBackgroundAction: Has image_path.\n\n- getRecommendationsAction: Has image_data.\n\n- resizeImageAction: No image input.\n\nThis is inconsistent. How do these functions know which image to operate on? Perhaps it's assumed from context, but in the tool call format, I just need to provide the params as specified.\n\nThe user didn't provide any image details. For functions like rotate and flip, they don't require an image path in their args, so maybe I can just call them.\n\nBut that seems odd. For example, removeBackgroundAction requires image_path, which the user hasn't provided.\n\nIn the user's request, they say \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally\", implying there's an existing image, but no details are given.\n\nFor rotateImageAction and flipImageAction, since they don't list an image parameter, I might proceed.\n\nTo be precise, I need to check if the functions can be called with the given information.\n\nFor flipImageAction:\n\n- flip_direction: 'horizontal'\n\nFor rotateImageAction:\n\n- degrees: 20\n\n- Other params have defaults.\n\nSo, I can call both.\n\nI need to output in the exact format: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSince there are two actions, I'll include both in one TOOLCALL section.\n\nThe format allows multiple functions: [func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]\n\nOrder might matter; probably rotate first then flip, or as per user request. User said \"turn it by 20 degree and flip it horizontally\", so perhaps rotate first.\n\nIn image processing, the order can affect the result, but I'll just follow the sequence.\n\nFinally, my response should only be the TOOLCALL section, nothing else.\n\nSo, I'll write:\n\n<TOOLCALL>[rotateImageAction(degrees=20), flipImageAction(flip_direction='horizontal')]</TOOLCALL>\n\nThat seems straightforward."}

Its arguments are:\n\n- location (str): The location in the format 'City, State (abbr)', like 'San Francisco, CA'.\n\n- unit (str, default='fahrenheit'): So, it defaults to Fahrenheit, which matches the user's request.\n\nI need to call this function for each location. The tool call format allows me to make one or more function calls in a single response.\n\nThe user mentioned two locations: Boston, MA and San Francisco, CA. I should make separate calls for each to get the weather individually.\n\nIn the multi-turn behavior, I should try to complete the task in the current turn. So, I can call the function twice in one response.\n\nThe tool call format is: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params), func_name2(params)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nI can include multiple function calls in one <TOOLCALL> section.\n\nFor Boston, MA:\n\n- location: 'Boston, MA'\n\n- unit: 'fahrenheit' (which is the default, but I can specify it for clarity)\n\nFor San Francisco, CA:\n\n- location: 'San Francisco, CA'\n\n- unit: 'fahrenheit'\n\nThe function description says to use the short form for the state, which I am doing.\n\nThe user said \"Boston, MA and also in San Francisco in fahr\".

So, I need to fetch mandates for these specific users.\n\nAvailable functions:\n\n1. **user.mandates**: This function fetches mandates for a specific user based on their name and status. Args: name (str), status (str, default='active').\n\n2. **partner.mandates**: This function fetches mandates for a partner based on status. It doesn't take a user name; it's for partners. Args: status (str, default='all').\n\nThe user's request is about specific users, not partners. So, **user.mandates** seems more appropriate because it allows specifying a user's name.\n\nThe user wants mandates for two users: \"parath\" and \"bhanu\", and for statuses: pending and active.\n\n**user.mandates** takes one name at a time, so I might need to call it multiple times, once for each user.\n\nFor statuses, the function allows specifying a status, like 'active' or 'pending'. But it defaults to 'active'. The user wants both 'pending' and 'active' for each user.\n\nThe function description: \"status (str, default='active')\". So, for each call, I can specify one status.\n\nTo get both, I might need to make multiple calls for each user: one for 'active' and one for 'pending'.\n\nThe function is designed to fetch for one status per call.\n\nFor **user.mandates**, I need to call it separately for each combination: for user \"parath\" with status 'active', for \"parath\" with status 'pending', and same for \"bhanu\".\n\nThe tool call format allows multiple functions in one response: <TOOLCALL>[func1(), func2(), ...]</TOOLCALL>\n\nSo, I can list multiple calls in one go.\n\nPossible calls:\n\n1. user.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"active\")\n\n2. user.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"pending\")\n\n3. user.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"active\")\n\n4. user.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"pending\")\n\nThat covers all.\n\nIs \"pending\" a valid status? The function description doesn't specify what statuses are available, but based on the user's query, I'll assume it's valid.\n\nThe user said \"all pending and active mandates\", so I'll proceed.\n\nThe task says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" So, I should make all necessary calls now.\n\nFinally, output only in the <TOOLCALL> format.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n\n[\n\nuser.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"active\"),\n\nuser.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"pending\"),\n\nuser.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"active\"),\n\nuser.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"pending\")\n\n]\n\n</TOOLCALL>\n\nThe exact format specified: <TOOLCALL>[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), func_name2(...)]</TOOLCALL>\n\nYes, like that."}
