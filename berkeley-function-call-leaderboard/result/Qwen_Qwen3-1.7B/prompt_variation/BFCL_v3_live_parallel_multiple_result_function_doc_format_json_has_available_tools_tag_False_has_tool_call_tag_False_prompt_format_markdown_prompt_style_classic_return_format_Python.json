They also want to update their drink order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's ChaFod for changing food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the food part, the ChaFod function requires foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user wants to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". The foodItem is \"Caesar salad\", so that's the parameter. The newIngredients are not specified, so leave that as default. The specialInstructions would be \"without anchovies\".\n\nThen, for the drink, the ChaDri.change_drink function needs drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences should include size, temperature, sweetness_level, milk_type. The user wants large size, hot temperature, regular sweetness, and almond milk. So size is 'large', temperature 'hot', sweetness_level 'regular', milk_type 'almond'. The default for size is medium, but the user specified large, so that's set. Similarly, other parameters are set as per the user's request.\n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, and removeIngredients is optional but needed here. For ChaDri.change_drink, drink_id is required, and new_preferences includes all the necessary fields. So the function calls should be made with these parameters."}

The function needs a 'location' parameter, which should be in the format 'City, State (abbr)' or 'City, Country'. For Guangzhou, it's 'Guangzhou, CN' and for Beijing, 'Beijing, CN'. The unit is set to metric by default, so I don't need to specify it unless the user wants imperial, but they asked for metric, so that's covered.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"\u4e2d\u56fd\u5e7f\u5dde\u5e02\" and \"\u4e2d\u56fd\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\", so the locations are Guangzhou and Beijing. The function's location parameter accepts 'City, Country' format. So I can call the function twice, once for each city. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted. For each call, the location is the city name followed by 'CN' for China. The unit is already defaulting to metric, so no need to include it. \n\nSo the function calls would be: get_current_weather(location='Guangzhou, CN') and get_current_weather(location='Beijing, CN').

For the second request, location is Letterkenny, Ireland, category is Technology, and language is en. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"focusing on technology news again in English\" for Letterkenny. So the category should be Technology. The default for category is General, but the user wants Technology. So I need to set category to Technology for the second call. \n\nI need to make two function calls. The first one for Paris, France, with default category and language.

The user has provided a series of steps to perform on a repository. Let me break down each step and see which functions I can use.\n\nFirst, step 1 is to clone the repo from git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The available functions include 'clone_repo', which requires the repo_url and optionally destination. Since the user provided the URL, I'll need to call clone_repo with repo_url set to that URL. The destination is defaulting to the current directory, which is fine.\n\nNext, step 2.1 is to create or update a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The 'create_a_docker_file' function requires a directory_name. But the user hasn't specified a directory name yet. Wait, the clone step might have created a directory, but the user hasn't mentioned it. Hmm, maybe the directory is the same as the cloned repo. So I'll need to call create_a_docker_file with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path. But the clone function's destination is defaulting to '.', so maybe the directory is '.'.\n\nThen step 2.2 is to create Kubernetes YAMLs. The 'create_kubernetes_yaml_file' function needs a directory_name. Again, if the cloned repo is in the current directory, then directory_name would be '.'.\n\nStep 3 is to add all changed files to git. The 'push_git_changes_to_github' function requires a directory_name and other parameters. But the user hasn't mentioned a commit message or branch name. The default commit message is 'Update changes', and branch is 'main', force_push is False. So I can call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory_name as the cloned repo's path.\n\nWait, but the steps are in order. Let me check again. The user's steps are:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Analyse contents and create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n3. Add all changes to git.\n4. Commit and push.\n\nSo after cloning, the next step is to analyse the repo contents. The 'analyse_repo_contents' function requires a directory_name. If the cloned repo is in the current directory (default), then directory_name is '.'.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='.')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='.')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='.')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='.', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False)\n\nBut wait, the user's steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is handled by push_git_changes_to_github. Then commit and push.\n\nBut the user's step 3 is to add all changed files, which is what the push function does. Then step 4 is commit and push.\n\nSo the function calls would be in order. Let me make sure all parameters are correctly set. For the push function, the directory_name is the cloned repo's path. The commit message is default, but the user might want to specify it. However, the user didn't mention a specific message, so the default is okay.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\nclone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='.'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='.'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='.'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='.', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main', force_push=False).\n\nBut wait, the user's step 3 is to add all changed files, which is done by the push function. Then step 4 is commit and push. So the push function is called once after adding the changes.\n\nSo the final function calls are as above. I need to make sure that each function is called in the correct order and with the right parameters."}

The user is working on a Java project and has a compilation error related to the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They need help finding relevant classes and the method signatures.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides several methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult'. So, the first task is to find classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The available tool is 'get_relevant_classes', which takes a search string, case sensitivity, and include_subdirectories. The search string here would be 'CellResult', and include_subdirectories is set to True. The case sensitivity is default False, but maybe the user wants to check both cases, but the default is False, so maybe leave it as is.\n\nNext, the user wants the signatures of 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. The parameters needed are class_name and method_name. For 'setCellValue', class_name is 'AbstractCellHandler' and method_name is 'setCellValue'. Similarly for 'getCellValue'. The include_private parameter is False by default, but the user might want to ensure they're not including private methods, so it's safe to leave it as default.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the signatures of the methods in 'AbstractCellHandler', so the function call would be get_signature with class_name='AbstractCellHandler' and method_name='setCellValue' and 'getCellValue'. The include_private is False by default, but maybe the user wants to make sure. But the function's default is False, so it's okay.\n\nSo, the two function calls would be get_relevant_classes with search_string='CellResult' and include_subdirectories=True, and get_signature for both methods. The user might need to check if the classes found are relevant, but the function will return them. The answer should include both function calls."}

The units here are in centimeters, but the function just needs the numerical value, so that's straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The other tool is get_current_weather, which needs a 'location' parameter. The location here is \"Queenstown Singapore\". The function also has a 'unit' parameter, but the user didn't specify, so default to 'fahrenheit' as per the tool's default. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls.
