The height is required, initial_velocity is optional with a default of zero, and gravity is optional with a default of 9.81.

The user wants to find records in the user table where age is greater than 25 and job is 'engineer'. I need to use the database.query function provided. The function requires the table name and conditions. The table is 'user'. The conditions are age > 25 and job = 'engineer'. So I'll structure the conditions array with those parameters. Make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as a JSON object. Let me check the function's parameters again. The conditions are an array of objects with key-value pairs. So each condition should be an object. Wait, the example might need an array of objects. So maybe each condition is an object in the array. Like [{\"age\": 25}, {\"job\": \"engineer\"}]? Or maybe it's a single object with both conditions. Wait, the function's parameters for conditions is an array, but each element is a condition. Hmm, maybe the conditions are an array of key-value pairs. Wait, the description says \"conditions for the query\" which is an array. So perhaps each condition is an object in the array. For example, [{\"age\": \">\", 25}, {\"job\": \"=\", \"engineer\"}]? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of key-value pairs. Wait, the function's parameters for conditions is an array, but each element is a condition. So maybe each condition is an object with key and value. But in SQL, it's AND between the conditions. So perhaps the conditions array should have two objects: one for age > 25 and one for job = 'engineer'. But how to represent that in the parameters. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of key-value pairs where the key is the column name and the value is the condition. But I need to check the function's parameters. The function's parameters for conditions is an array, and each element is a condition. But the exact structure isn't specified. However, looking at the example, maybe each condition is an object with \"column\" and \"value\" keys. But since the user's question is to find age > 25 and job = 'engineer', perhaps the conditions array should have two entries: one for age with value 25 and operator '>', and another for job with value 'engineer' and operator '='. But the function's parameters don't specify operators. Wait, the function's parameters for conditions is an array of objects. Each object has \"column\" and \"value\" as keys. But the user's query is age > 25 and job is 'engineer'. So maybe the conditions are an array of two objects: {\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25} and {\"column\": \"job\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}, but then how to specify the operator. Alternatively, maybe the function expects the conditions to be in a format that can be translated into SQL WHERE clauses. For example, the conditions array could be a list of key-value pairs where the key is the column name and the value is the value to compare. But since the user is using \"greater than\" and \"equals\", perhaps the function expects the conditions to be in a format that includes the operator. However, the function's parameters don't mention operators. This is a bit ambiguous. But given the function's parameters, maybe the conditions are an array of objects where each object has \"column\" and \"value\", and the operator is inferred. For example, if the user wants age > 25, maybe the condition is {\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25} and the operator is '>'. But since the function's parameters don't specify operators, perhaps the function is designed to handle this by using a specific format. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of key-value pairs where the key is the column name and the value is the value to match, and the operator is part of the function's internal logic. But this is unclear. However, given the function's parameters, the user's question requires that the conditions are age > 25 and job = 'engineer'. So I'll structure the conditions as an array of two objects: one for age and one for job. So the parameters would be table: \"user\", conditions: [{\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25}, {\"column\": \"job\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}]. But I'm not sure if the function expects the operator to be included. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of key-value pairs where the operator is part of the value. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of strings like \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But the function's parameters for conditions is an array of objects. Hmm. Maybe the function is designed to take an array of objects where each object has \"column\" and \"value\", and the operator is determined by the context. For example, if the value is a number and the column is age, it might be a greater than condition. But this is speculative. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the conditions are an array of objects with \"column\" and \"value\", and the function will handle the operator based on the context. Therefore, the correct function call would be database.query with table \"user\" and conditions [{\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25}, {\"column\": \"job\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}]. But wait, the user's condition is age > 25, so maybe the value is 25 and the operator is '>'. However, the function's parameters don't include an operator. Therefore, perhaps the function is designed to accept the conditions as a list of key-value pairs where the operator is inferred. For example, if the value is a number and the column is age, it's a greater than condition. But this is not clear. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are a list of key-value pairs where the operator is part of the value. For example, \"age > 25\" and \"job = 'engineer'\". But the function's parameters for conditions is an array of objects. So perhaps each condition is an object with \"column\" and \"value\", and the operator is part of the value. But that's not clear.

Therefore, the correct function call is to use database.query with table \"user\" and conditions [{\"column\": \"age\", \"value\": 25}, {\"column\": \"job\", \"value\": \"engineer\"}].

But the function's parameters for conditions is an array of objects. So perhaps each condition is an object with \"column\" and \"value\", and the value is a string like \"age > 25\". But that's not clear. Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the initial approach."}

The status is specified as ongoing, which is the default, so maybe I don't need to include it unless the default is different. Wait, the function says the status parameter is optional with a default of 'ongoing', so since the user mentioned ongoing, I can include it explicitly or rely on the default. But since the user specified \"ongoing\", maybe it's better to include it to be safe. Wait, the default is already ongoing, so maybe it's redundant, but including it won't hurt.

The parameters needed are all present in the query: location is New York, genre is pop, and date is next month. I need to make sure the date parameter is formatted correctly. The user said \"next month,\" so maybe the function expects a specific date range. But since the function's date parameter is a string, I can input \"next month\" as is. Alternatively, maybe it's better to convert \"next month\" into a specific date, but the function's description says it's a time frame, so \"next month\" should be acceptable. Let me structure the function call with the given parameters."}
