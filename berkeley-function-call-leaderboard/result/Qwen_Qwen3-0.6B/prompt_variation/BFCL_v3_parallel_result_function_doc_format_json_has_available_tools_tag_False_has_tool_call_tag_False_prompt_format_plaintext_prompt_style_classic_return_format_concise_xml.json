The function's parameters are purchase_price (integer), sale_price (integer), and dividend (integer). The required parameters are purchase_price and sale_price, but the dividend is optional with a default of 0. Wait, the user provided dividends of $20, $30, $40. So for each stock, I need to plug those values into the function.\n\nSo for the first stock: purchase_price $150, sale_price $180, dividend $20. The function should calculate (sale_price - purchase_price) / purchase_price * 100, which would be (180-150)/150 * 100 = 20%. Similarly for the others. The user mentioned three stocks, so three function calls. Each with their respective parameters. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as integers. The required parameters are present, so all three can be called. The function doesn't require any other parameters, so no issues there. The answer should list three function calls with each stock's details."}

Let me check the functions available. There's the algebra.quadratic_roots function which takes parameters a, b, c. The user provided the first equation as 3x\u00b2 +7x +2=0, so a=3, b=7, c=2. The second equation is 5x\u00b2 -4x +1=0, so a=5, b=-4, c=1. Both equations have the same parameters as the function requires. I need to call the function twice, once for each equation. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as integers. Yes, all values are integers. So the function calls should be two separate invocations with the respective a, b, c values."}

The facilities array includes options like Wi-Fi, Reading Room, Fiction, Children Section, and Cafe. \n\nFor New York: location is \"New York, NY\", facilities should be [\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]. \n\nFor Los Angeles: location is \"Los Angeles, CA\", facilities [\"Wi-Fi\", \"Children Section\"]. \n\nFor Chicago: location is \"Chicago, IL\", facilities [\"Cafe\", \"Reading Room\"]. \n\nEach of these parameters are required and the function expects an array of strings. So I need to call the function three times with each city and the respective facilities. I should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as per the function's requirements."}
