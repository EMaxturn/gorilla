We can call the function once for each movie and time, but note that the function can take an array of movies and an array of times. \n\n But the problem: the function might be designed to look for any of the movies at any of the times? However, the user's request is for two specific movies at two specific times. We want to find theaters that have:\n   - Tenet at 5 pm AND\n   - No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\n\n However, note that the function might not be designed to handle such a complex query (i.e., two movies at two specific times). The description says: \"Find local movie theatres and their schedule for a specific movie\". It might be intended for one movie (or a list of movies) and a list of times, but then it would return showings for any of the movies at any of the times.\n\n But the user wants a theater that has both showings. We have two options:\n\n Option 1: Call the function for each movie individually and then in the next step (if we had more functions) we could intersect the theaters. However, we don't have a function to do that.\n\n Option 2: Since the function allows an array of movies and an array of times, we can try to pass both movies and both times and then in the result we would have to check for each theater if it has both the specific movie at the specific time. But note: the function might return any showing that matches either movie at either time.\n\n Given that we have only this function and the system will run the function and return the data, we must design the call appropriately.\n\n However, note the requirement: we are to return two movie theaters that meet both conditions? Actually, the user says \"Find two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\" This implies that each theater must have both showings? Or two theaters each having one of the showings? The phrasing is ambiguous, but the use of \"and\" suggests that each theater should have both.\n\n But note: the user says \"two movie theatres\", meaning two different theaters? And each must have both? Or two theaters that together cover both? The request is: \"with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\". The \"and\" likely means both conditions must be met for a single theater? Because if it were two separate theaters, it might say \"one with ... and another with ...\".\n\n However, the problem says \"Find two movie theatres\", so we need two theaters that each have both showings? That seems odd because one theater having both showings is already one, and then we need another one that also has both? \n\n Alternatively, the user might mean: find two theaters that together can show both movies at the specified times? But that would be one theater for Tenet and another for No Time To Die.\n\n Let me re-read: \"Find two movie theatres near San Diego with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\"\n\n The most natural interpretation is: find two theaters (each) that have both showings? Because if they are separate, then the theater for Tenet doesn't need to have No Time To Die and vice versa. But the request says \"with availability for ... and ...\", meaning the theater must have both.\n\n However, that would be very restrictive and the user wants two such theaters.\n\n But note: the user might be going to two movies in one night? That is, they want to watch Tenet at 5 pm and then No Time To Die at 7:30 pm in the same theater? Or in two different theaters? The request does not specify same theater.\n\n However, the way it's phrased: \"with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\" for each theater? Or for the two theaters collectively? The problem says \"two movie theatres\", so it's two theaters that each have both? That doesn't make sense because one theater can show both movies.\n\n Alternatively, it might be that the user wants two theaters that have the two showings (each theater having one of the showings) so that they can choose one theater for Tenet and another for No Time To Die? But then the request would be for two theaters: one for Tenet and one for No Time To Die.\n\n But the request says each theater must have both? Actually, the phrasing is ambiguous.\n\n Since we are limited by the function, and the function can take an array of movies and an array of times, we can do:\n\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n Then the function will return theaters that have at least one of the movies at at least one of the times. But that doesn't guarantee that a theater has both.\n\n However, we don't have a way to ask for both in one call. Therefore, we might have to break it into two calls:\n\n Call 1: For Tenet at 5 pm\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"Tenet\"]\n   time: [\"5 pm\"]\n\n Call 2: For No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\n   location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n   movie: [\"No Time To Die\"]\n   time: [\"7:30 pm\"]\n\n Then we can get two sets of theaters. We are to find two theaters that are in both sets? But note: the user might want two theaters that each have both showings? Then we would need to take the intersection of the two sets (theaters that appear in both results) and then pick two of them.\n\n Alternatively, if the user wants two theaters that together cover both showings (so one for each movie), then we don't need the same theater to have both. We just need two theaters: one from the first call (for Tenet) and one from the second call (for No Time To Die).\n\n The problem says: \"Find two movie theatres ... with availability for Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\" This could be interpreted as:\n\n   Theater 1: has Tenet at 5 pm\n   Theater 2: has No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\n\n OR\n\n   Theater 1: has both\n   Theater 2: has both\n\n But note: the user says \"two movie theatres\", so if we interpret as two theaters each having both, then we are returning two theaters that each have both. But that might be overkill and the user might only need one theater to watch both movies? \n\n Alternatively, the user might be planning two separate outings? We don't know.\n\n Since the request is ambiguous, and we have only the function `find_movie_showing`, we must make a decision.\n\n Given that we are to return two theaters, and the function doesn't support a complex condition, we can do:\n\n   Option: Two separate calls.\n\n   First call: for Tenet at 5 pm -> returns list of theaters showing Tenet at 5 pm.\n   Second call: for No Time To Die at 7:30 pm -> returns list of theaters showing No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\n\n   Then we can pick one theater from the first list and one from the second list? But the user says \"two movie theatres\", so that would be two theaters: one for each.\n\n   However, the problem says \"with availability for ... and ...\", meaning the two theaters together have both? Then that would satisfy.\n\n   But note: the user might want the two theaters to be near each other? The problem says \"near San Diego\", which we have as the location.\n\n   Alternatively, if we interpret that each theater must have both, then we would need to do:\n\n      First call: for Tenet at 5 pm -> get set A\n      Second call: for No Time To Die at 7:30 pm -> get set B\n      Then the theaters that are in both set A and set B are the ones that have both.\n\n      Then we pick two of those.\n\n   How can we achieve that? We don't have a function to intersect. We can only call the function and then we (the assistant) would have to process? But note: the instructions say we are to output function calls and then the system will run them and return the results. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to make more function calls? But the problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\". However, we don't have a function to process the results (like set intersection). We only have `find_movie_showing`.\n\n   Therefore, we must break the problem into two steps:\n\n   Step 1: Get the theaters for Tenet at 5 pm.\n   Step 2: Get the theaters for No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\n\n   Then, if we are to return two theaters that each have both, we would need to compare the results? But we cannot do that in one turn because we are only allowed to output function calls and then the system will run and return the results in the next turn? Actually, the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks ... Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n   We are at the first turn. We can output two function calls? The format allows multiple <function> tags within one <TOOLCALL>. \n\n   But note: the function `find_movie_showing` returns theaters and their schedule. We don't know the structure of the return. However, the function description doesn't specify that it returns only one theater. It returns multiple.\n\n   How about we make two separate calls? One for each condition.\n\n   We can do:\n\n      <TOOLCALL>\n        <functions>\n          <function name=\"find_movie_showing\">\n            <params>\n              <param name=\"location\" value=\"San Diego, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n              <param name=\"movie\" value=\"['Tenet']\" type=\"array\"/>\n              <param name=\"time\" value=\"['5 pm']\" type=\"array\"/>\n            </params>\n          </function>\n          <function name=\"find_movie_showing\">\n            <params>\n              <param name=\"location\" value=\"San Diego, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n              <param name=\"movie\" value=\"['No Time To Die']\" type=\"array\"/>\n              <param name=\"time\" value=\"['7:30 pm']\" type=\"array\"/>\n            </params>\n          </function>\n        </functions>\n      </TOOLCALL>\n\n   Then, in the next turn, we will receive the results for both calls. We can then:\n\n      - For the first condition (Tenet at 5 pm): we have a list of theaters.\n      - For the second condition (No Time To Die at 7:30 pm): we have a list of theaters.\n\n   Then, if the user wants two theaters that each have both, we would need to find the theaters that are in both lists. But we don't have a function to do that. We would have to do it in our reasoning? But we are only allowed to output function calls.\n\n   Alternatively, if the user wants two theaters (one for each), then we can just pick one from the first list and one from the second list.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"with availability for ... and ...\", which might be interpreted as each theater having both. But that is very strict and we cannot get that with the current function without further processing.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I think we should go with the interpretation that the user wants two theaters that together provide both showings. That is, one theater for Tenet and one for No Time To Die.\n\n   Why? Because if the user wanted a single theater that has both, they might have said: \"Find a movie theatre that has Tenet at 5 pm and No Time To Die at 7:30 pm, and then also find another one (if exists)\". But the request says \"two movie theatres\" and then the condition.\n\n   Alternatively, the user might be looking for two options (each option being a theater that has both). But then we would need two theaters that each have both.\n\n   Without more context, and since the function does not support a complex query, we will break it into two calls and then in the next turn we can process the results.\n\n   However, note: we are only allowed to output the function calls in the current turn. We cannot process until the next turn.\n\n   Therefore, we output two function calls.\n\n   But note: the function parameters are arrays. We are passing an array of one movie and an array of one time for each call.\n\n   Alternatively, we could make one call with both movies and both times? Then we get all theaters that have either movie at either time. Then we can, in the next turn, check for each theater if it has both showings? But we don't have a function to process that. We are only allowed to call functions.\n\n   However, in the next turn, we might not need to call any function? We can just use the data we got to answer the user? But the instructions say: we are to output function calls until we have fulfilled the request. Then the system will consider the turn complete and then we get the next turn? Actually, the system will run the functions and then give us the results and then we can output again? So we can do:\n\n      Turn 1: call the function with both movies and both times? Then we get a list of theaters and their showings for these two movies and these two times.\n\n      Then in Turn 2: we can look at the results and for each theater, check if they have:\n          - Tenet at 5 pm\n          - No Time To Die at 7:30 pm\n\n      Then we can pick two theaters that satisfy both.\n\n   But we are not allowed to do that because we are only allowed to output function calls? And we don't have a function to do that check.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output multiple function calls in one turn? The format allows multiple <function> tags. But we are limited to the given function.\n\n   Given the constraints, I think we should do two separate calls for the two conditions. Then in the next turn, we can use the results to:\n\n        Option 1 (if the user wants two theaters each having one): we can just return one from the first result and one from the second.\n\n        Option 2 (if the user wants theaters that have both): we can take the intersection of the theater names from the two results and then pick two.\n\n   But we don't have a function to do the intersection? However, we are the assistant and in the next turn we will have the data. We can do the intersection in our own code? But the instructions say we must output function calls until we have fulfilled the request. Then the system will run the function calls and then we get the results and then we can output a natural language response? Actually, the problem does not specify. But note: the example format only shows function calls. Then the system will run them and return the results and then we can use the results to form the answer? But the instructions say: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.\"\n\n   So in the next turn, we are allowed to output the answer? Or we are allowed to output more function calls? The problem says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n   Since we don't have a function to do the intersection, we have to do it ourselves in the next turn? But we are only allowed to output function calls? This is a dilemma.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"If none of the functions can be used, point it out.\" But we are using the function. And we are using two calls.\n\n   The system might run both calls and then give us the results. Then we can use the results to form the answer without calling any more functions? That is, we have fulfilled the request by making the two calls and then we can use the results to compute the answer.\n\n   But the instructions say: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\" and \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format ...\". It does not say we cannot output anything else in the next turn? Actually, the problem says: \"Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete\".\n\n   So we are in the first turn. We output two function calls. Then the system runs them and returns the results. Then in the second turn, we don't call any function? We just output the answer? That is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we output two function calls in the first turn.\n\n   But note: the function `find_movie_showing` might return a list of theaters. We are going to get two lists:\n\n        List1: theaters showing Tenet at 5 pm.\n        List2: theaters showing No Time To Die at 7:30 pm.\n\n   Then in the next turn, we can do:\n\n        If the user wants two theaters that together cover both (one from list1 and one from list2), then we can choose two theaters: one from list1 and one from list2.\n\n        If the user wants two theaters that each have both, then we need to find theaters that are in both lists? But wait: a theater in list1 only tells us that it has Tenet at 5 pm, but not necessarily that it has No Time To Die at 7:30 pm. Similarly, a theater in list2 only tells us that it has No Time To Die at 7:30 pm. We don't know about the other movie.\n\n   Therefore, the two separate calls do not give us the information to find a theater that has both. We would need to know for a theater that is in list1, does it also have No Time To Die at 7:30 pm? We don't have that.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do:\n\n        Step 1: Call for Tenet at 5 pm -> get list A.\n        Step 2: For each theater in list A, we call the function again to check if that theater has No Time To Die at 7:30 pm? But that would be too many calls and we don't know the list A until we get the result.\n\n   Given the ambiguity of the user's request, and the limitations of the function, I think the best we can do is:\n\n        Option: Make one call that includes both movies and both times? Then we get all theaters that have either movie at either time. Then we can, in the next turn, look at the detailed schedule of each theater to see if any theater has both showings? But the function returns the schedule? We don't know the exact structure, but the description says: \"their schedule\". So we might get for each theater the movies and showtimes.\n\n   How about we make one call:\n\n        location: \"San Diego, CA\"\n        movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n        time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n   Then we get a list of theaters and for each theater, we get the showtimes for the two movies? We hope that the function returns the showtimes for each movie separately.\n\n   Then in the next turn, we can check for each theater:\n\n        - Does it have Tenet at 5 pm?\n        - Does it have No Time To Die at 7:30 pm?\n\n   Then we can collect the theaters that have both and pick two.\n\n   This seems more efficient and gives us the ability to find theaters that have both.\n\n   Therefore, I will make one call with both movies and both times.\n\n   But note: the function parameters are arrays. We can pass:\n\n        movie: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n        time: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n   We are not sure if the function will return only the exact matches or also other showtimes? The description says: \"schedule for a specific movie\". But it doesn't say only the given times. However, the `time` parameter is required and we are passing an array of times. So it might filter to only these times? Or it might return showings around these times? We don't know.\n\n   Given the information, we have to assume that the function will return showings that match the given movies and the given times.\n\n   But note: the function might return any showing that matches any of the movies and any of the times. So we might get:\n\n        Theater1: \n            Tenet: [5 pm, 8 pm]\n            No Time To Die: [7:30 pm, 10 pm]\n\n        Theater2:\n            Tenet: [5 pm]\n\n        Theater3:\n            No Time To Die: [7:30 pm]\n\n   Then we can see that Theater1 has both.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>\n          <functions>\n            <function name=\"find_movie_showing\">\n              <params>\n                <param name=\"location\" value=\"San Diego, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n                <param name=\"movie\" value=\"['Tenet','No Time To Die']\" type=\"array\"/>\n                <param name=\"time\" value=\"['5 pm','7:30 pm']\" type=\"array\"/>\n              </params>\n            </function>\n          </functions>\n        </TOOLCALL>\n\n   Then in the next turn, we will get the result and we can filter the theaters that have both showings and then pick two.\n\n   But note: the user might be okay with this. And we don't need to call any more functions.\n\n   Therefore, I choose this approach.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"find two movie theatres\". We are making one call that returns multiple theaters. Then we can pick two that have both.\n\n   But what if we don't get two? Then we might have to try something else? We'll deal with that in the next turn.\n\n   So, in this turn, we output one function call.\n\n   Let's format the call:\n\n        location: \"San Diego, CA\" (string)\n        movie: array of two strings: [\"Tenet\", \"No Time To Die\"]\n        time: array of two strings: [\"5 pm\", \"7:30 pm\"]\n\n   Note: the time strings: we are using \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\" as given.\n\n   We output:\n\n        <TOOLCALL>\n          <functions>\n            <function name=\"find_movie_showing\">\n              <params>\n                <param name=\"location\" value=\"San Diego, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n                <param name=\"movie\" value=\"['Tenet','No Time To Die']\" type=\"array\"/>\n                <param name=\"time\" value=\"['5 pm','7:30 pm']\" type=\"array\"/>\n              </params>\n            </function>\n          </functions>\n        </TOOLCALL>\n\n   But note: the type of the array elements? The function expects the array to contain strings? The parameter type for `movie` and `time` is array, but it doesn't specify the element type. But in the example, we are using strings.\n\n   This should be acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, if the function expects the times in a specific format (e.g., 24-hour), but the user said \"5 pm\" and \"7:30 pm\", we use that.\n\n   We'll go with that."}

But the instruction also says to only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\n We are required to output in the <TOOLCALL> format and nothing else.\n\n Therefore, we must call the function for each request, but we cannot include quantities because the function doesn't take or return them.\n\n However, the function does not require quantity as a parameter, so we can call it without quantities.\n\n But note: the function does not have a parameter for quantity, so we are not lacking any required parameters for the function call.\n\n The function requires:\n   - paint_type: we have \"watercolor\" for magenta and \"acrylic\" for navy.\n   - color: we have \"magenta\" and \"navy\".\n\n So we can make two function calls.\n\n However, the function does not return quantities? We don't know. The description says: \"Gives a combination of primary colors to mix\". \n It might return the list of colors and their ratios? But we are not told.\n\n But the instruction says: we are to use the given functions. We don't have another function for quantities.\n\n Therefore, we can only call the function and hope that the returned information includes quantities? \n But the problem does not specify the return value.\n\n Since we are only allowed to call the function and we have the required parameters, we will call it.\n\n We are to make one or more function calls.\n\n We'll make two calls:\n  1. For watercolor and color magenta.\n  2. For acrylic and color navy.\n\n But note: the function does not have a parameter for quantities, so we cannot specify quantities in the call.\n\n Therefore, we output two function calls.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n In this case, we have the required parameters (paint_type and color) for both calls.\n\n But the user asked for quantities, which the function does not require as input. We are not lacking any required parameters.\n\n So we proceed.\n\n But note: the function might not return quantities? We don't know. We can only call and see what the function returns.\n\n We are to return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\n\n We'll do:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"paint_color_mixture\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"paint_type\" value=\"watercolor\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"color\" value=\"magenta\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"paint_color_mixture\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"paint_type\" value=\"acrylic\" type=\"string\"/>\n      <param name=\"color\" value=\"navy\" type=\"string\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note that the function name is the same for both. That is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the function description does not say it returns quantities. We are not fulfilling the user's request for quantities. \n However, we are only allowed to use the provided function. We don't have a function that returns quantities.\n\n We are to do our best with the functions we have.\n\n Therefore, we make the two calls and hope that the function returns the mixture including quantities? \n But if the function does not, then we have to note that in a subsequent turn? But we are only allowed to output the function calls.\n\n We follow the instruction: output the function calls.\n\n Alternatively, we might have to note that we cannot get quantities? But the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section.\"\n\n So we output the two function calls.\n\n But note: the user asked for two things in one question. We are making two calls, which is acceptable.\n\n Let's write the XML accordingly."}

We have two cities: Berlin and Paris.\n Therefore, we need to make two separate function calls: one for Berlin and one for Paris.\n\n Also, we need to determine the date for next Friday. The user says \"next Friday\". Since we don't have a function to compute dates, \n we must assume that we can compute it in our mind or we are allowed to output the actual date string for next Friday.\n But note: the problem says \"if the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n However, we are expected to compute the date as an AI. Since the current date is not provided, we must rely on the system to provide the current date? \n But in the context of this problem, we are to output the function calls.

We note that the user said \"next Friday\", so we can compute the date of next Friday and then use that.\n\n However, without knowing the current date, we cannot compute it.

But the user did provide a relative date. \n\n However, we are to output function calls. We cannot compute the absolute date without knowing today. \n\n Since the problem does not give the current date, we must use the relative string. We hope the backend function can interpret relative dates.\n\n Alternatively, we might have to use an absolute date. But without the current date, we cannot.\n\n How to resolve?\n We must use the string \"next Friday\" as the date and hope the function can handle it. If the function cannot, then we might get an error, but that's beyond our control.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function might not accept relative dates and then we would have to point out that we lack the absolute date. \n But the problem says: \"If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\" \n The user did provide a relative date, but the function might require an absolute one. \n\n Since the function description does not specify the format, we will assume it can take relative dates or we are in a context where the backend will resolve it.\n\n Therefore, we will use:\n   date: \"next Friday\"\n\n For amenities, we want parking.

But that might be ambiguous.\n\n Alternatively, the system might expect a JSON-like representation? \n\n Since the instruction does not specify, and we are in XML, we must use a string representation that the backend can parse. \n We'll use a JSON-like representation without the quotes for the entire string? \n\n But note: the example in the instruction does not show an array. \n\n We are told to output the type as \"array\". So for the value, we write a string that represents an array? \n\n However, the system that processes the function call will parse the value as an array? \n\n How about: \n   value=\"['parking']\"\n\n But note: the value attribute in XML must be a string. So we write it as a string that can be parsed as an array.\n\n Alternatively, we might have to use a comma-separated string? But the function expects an array of strings. \n\n Since the function expects an array, we'll use the JSON representation. \n\n But note: the function description says \"amenities\" is an array. We'll use the JSON array representation as a string.\n\n However, the instruction does not specify how to represent non-string types. But the example uses value=\"value1\" which is a string. \n We must represent the array as a string. \n\n We'll use: \n   value='[\"parking\"]'\n\n But note: we are inside an XML attribute, so we must escape quotes. We can use single quotes for the outer and double inside? \n   value=\"['parking']\"   -> this is not JSON but Python-like.\n\n Alternatively, we can use double quotes inside and escape? But the XML attribute is already using double quotes. \n\n We can do: \n   value=\"[&quot;parking&quot;]\"\n\n But that is messy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the entire attribute? \n   <param name=\"amenities\" value='[\"parking\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n\n That is acceptable.\n\n However, the instruction does not specify the exact serialization. Since we are in a simulated environment, we'll use the representation that the backend expects.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will use: \n   value='[\"parking\"]'\n\n But note: the problem says the type is array, so the backend will know to parse it as an array.\n\n Alternatively, the system might expect a simple comma-separated string? But the function description says it's an array of amenities. \n\n Since the function expects an array, we will pass it as a JSON string. \n\n However, the function might also accept a simple string? But the type is array. \n\n We'll go with the JSON representation.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the function might be implemented to split a string? But the type is array, so we assume it expects a structured value.\n\n Given the above, we output:\n\n   <TOOLCALL>\n     <functions>\n        <function name=\"concert.find_nearby\">\n          <params>\n             <param name=\"location\" value=\"Berlin\" type=\"string\"/>\n             <param name=\"date\" value=\"next Friday\" type=\"string\"/>\n             <param name=\"genre\" value=\"classical\" type=\"string\"/>\n             <param name=\"amenities\" value='[\"parking\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n          </params>\n        </function>\n        <function name=\"concert.find_nearby\">\n          <params>\n             <param name=\"location\" value=\"Paris\" type=\"string\"/>\n             <param name=\"date\" value=\"next Friday\" type=\"string\"/>\n             <param name=\"genre\" value=\"classical\" type=\"string\"/>\n             <param name=\"amenities\" value='[\"parking\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n          </params>\n        </function>\n     </functions>\n   </TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note that the function has the parameter \"amenities\" as required=\"false\", so we can omit it?

Then use that result to find the HCF with (90, 120). \n Second, we need to calculate the HCF of (36, 48). Then use that result to find the HCF with (72, 96).\n\n However, note that the function `math.hcf` only takes two integers at a time.

We cannot pass three numbers at once.\n\n      Alternatively, the user might mean: \n        Step i: HCF1 = hcf(45,60)\n        Step ii: Then compute HCF2 = hcf(90,120)\n        Step iii: Then compute HCF_final = hcf(HCF1, HCF2)\n\n      But note the problem says: \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". \n      This is ambiguous. However, the common practice is to compute the HCF of the two pairs separately and then the HCF of the two results.\n\n      Alternatively, the problem might be asking to compute the HCF of the first result (which is 15) and then the HCF of 15 and the next pair? \n      But that doesn't make sense because the next pair is two numbers. We can compute the HCF of 15 and 90, then take that result and compute with 120? \n      However, note that the HCF of 15 and 90 is 15, then HCF of 15 and 120 is 15.\n\n      But the HCF of (90,120) is 30. Then the HCF of 15 and 30 is 15.\n\n      So both methods yield 15.\n\n      However, the problem says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90, 120)\". \n      It does not specify whether to take the HCF of the result and the pair together (as a set of three) or to take the HCF of the result and the HCF of the pair.\n\n      Since the function only takes two numbers, we must do:\n\n        Option 2 (more straightforward and common): \n          Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60) \n          Step 2: h2 = hcf(90,120)\n          Step 3: h_final1 = hcf(h1, h2)\n\n      But note: the problem says \"use that result (i.e., the result from step 1) to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90,120)\". \n      This phrasing suggests that they want the HCF of the first result and the pair (90,120). However, the pair is two numbers. We cannot pass three.\n\n      Therefore, we interpret it as: \n          Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60) \n          Step 2: h2 = hcf(90,120)   # this gives the HCF for the pair (90,120)\n          Step 3: Then we find the HCF of h1 and h2? But the problem says \"with another pair\", meaning the entire pair? \n\n      Alternatively, we could do:\n          Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60) \n          Step 2: h_temp = hcf(h1, 90)   # now h_temp is the HCF of the first result and 90\n          Step 3: h_final1 = hcf(h_temp, 120)\n\n      This is equivalent to the HCF of the three numbers: 45,60,90,120? But note the problem doesn't say that. It says two pairs.\n\n      Given the ambiguity, I think the intended meaning is to compute the HCF of the two pairs and then the HCF of the two results.\n\n      Why? Because the problem says \"another pair of numbers\", so we treat that pair as a unit and compute its HCF first.\n\n      So we'll do:\n        Part A:\n          h1 = hcf(45,60)\n          h2 = hcf(90,120)\n          resultA = hcf(h1, h2)\n\n      Part B:\n          h3 = hcf(36,48)\n          h4 = hcf(72,96)\n          resultB = hcf(h3, h4)\n\n      Then we are done.\n\n But note: the problem says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90,120)\". \n It does not say to compute the HCF of the two pairs and then the HCF of the two results. It says \"with another pair\", meaning the pair (90,120). \n\n How about we break it down as:\n\n   Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60)   -> 15\n   Step 2: Now we have to find the HCF of the set {15, 90, 120}. But the function only takes two. So we do:\n        Step 2a: h_temp = hcf(15,90)   -> 15\n        Step 2b: resultA = hcf(15,120)  -> 15\n\n   Similarly, for the second part:\n        Step 1: h3 = hcf(36,48) -> 12\n        Step 2: h_temp2 = hcf(12,72) -> 12\n        Step 3: resultB = hcf(12,96) -> 12\n\n   But note: the HCF of (90,120) is 30, and the HCF of 15 and 30 is 15. So the two methods are consistent? \n   Actually, the HCF of the set {45,60,90,120} is 15? \n        Factors of 45: 1,3,5,9,15,45\n        Factors of 60: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60\n        Factors of 90: 1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90\n        Factors of 120: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120\n        Common factor: 15.\n\n   So both methods yield 15.\n\n   Similarly for the second set: \n        {36,48,72,96} -> HCF is 12? \n        Factors of 36: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36\n        Factors of 48: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24,48\n        Factors of 72: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72\n        Factors of 96: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24,32,48,96\n        Common factor: 12.\n\n   However, note that the problem states two separate pairs: (45,60) and (90,120) for the first set, and (36,48) and (72,96) for the second set.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I will choose the method that uses the function as it is designed (only two numbers at a time) and that is consistent with the problem.\n\n   The problem says: \"use that result (from the first pair) to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers (90,120)\".\n\n   This suggests that we should take the result from the first pair (which is 15) and then compute the HCF of 15 and the pair (90,120). \n\n   How to compute the HCF of 15 and the pair (90,120)? We can note that the HCF of three numbers a,b,c can be computed as:\n        hcf(a, b, c) = hcf( hcf(a,b), c )\n\n   So we can do:\n        Step 1: h1 = hcf(45,60) -> 15\n        Step 2: h_temp = hcf(15, 90) -> 15\n        Step 3: resultA = hcf(15, 120) -> 15\n\n   But note that the pair (90,120) is two numbers. We are effectively computing the HCF of 15, 90, and 120.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the HCF of the pair (90,120) to get 30, then compute the HCF of 15 and 30 to get 15.\n\n   Both are valid and give the same result.\n\n   Since the function only takes two numbers, we can break it down either way.\n\n   Let's do the second way (using the HCF of the second pair first) because it is more efficient (only 3 function calls for the entire problem) and the problem mentions \"another pair\".\n\n   Therefore, for the first set:\n        step1: h1 = hcf(45,60)   -> 15\n        step2: h2 = hcf(90,120)   -> 30\n        step3: resultA = hcf(15,30) -> 15\n\n   For the second set:\n        step1: h3 = hcf(36,48)   -> 12\n        step2: h4 = hcf(72,96)   -> 24\n        step3: resultB = hcf(12,24) -> 12\n\n   However, note: the problem asks for the HCF of the result from the first pair (36,48) with the pair (72,96). \n   We are interpreting that as: first compute the HCF of (36,48) -> h3, then compute the HCF of (72,96) -> h4, then compute the HCF of h3 and h4.\n\n   Alternatively, we could compute the HCF of h3 and the pair (72,96) by:\n        step1: h3 = 12\n        step2: temp = hcf(12,72) -> 12\n        step3: resultB = hcf(12,96) -> 12\n\n   So both ways yield 12.\n\n   Given that the problem says \"use that result to find the highest common factor with another pair of numbers\", I think the intended meaning is to compute the HCF of the first result and the entire second pair. But since we cannot pass three numbers, we have two options:\n\n   Option A: \n        Compute the HCF of the second pair first, then the HCF of the first result and that HCF.\n\n   Option B:\n        Compute the HCF of the first result and the first number of the pair, then with the second number.\n\n   Both are mathematically equivalent and yield the same result.\n\n   We'll choose Option A because it is more straightforward and the problem mentions \"another pair\", so we treat the pair as a unit.\n\n   Therefore, we will make the following function calls:\n\n   For the first set:\n        Call1: h1 = math.hcf(45,60)\n        Call2: h2 = math.hcf(90,120)\n        Call3: resultA = math.hcf(h1, h2)\n\n   For the second set:\n        Call4: h3 = math.hcf(36,48)\n        Call5: h4 = math.hcf(72,96)\n        Call6: resultB = math.hcf(h3, h4)\n\n   We must note that the function `math.hcf` only takes two integers. We have to break it down.\n\n   However, we cannot make multiple function calls in one go? The system expects a single <TOOLCALL> block that may contain multiple function calls.\n\n   We are allowed to output multiple function calls in the same <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n   But note: the function calls are independent and we can do them in one block.\n\n   However, the results of the first two calls are needed for the third, and similarly for the next two for the sixth.\n\n   We cannot chain the results in one block because we don't have the results yet. We are only allowed to output the function calls we want to make.\n\n   The system will run the functions and return the results. Then we can use the results in the next turn? \n\n   But the problem says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" and \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request\".\n\n   We have to break it into multiple turns? \n\n   However, note the instruction: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of <TOOLCALL> ... </TOOLCALL>\".\n\n   And we can put multiple function calls in the same <TOOLCALL> block? \n\n   But the system will run all the functions in the block and then return the results. However, the results of the first two are required for the third. So we cannot run the third function until we have the results of the first two.\n\n   Therefore, we must break the process into multiple steps:\n\n   Step 1: Call the first two functions (for the first set: h1 and h2) and the next two (for the second set: h3 and h4) in parallel? \n        But note: the system can run multiple independent functions in one go. However, the third function (resultA) depends on h1 and h2, and the sixth (resultB) depends on h3 and h4.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Turn 1: \n            Call1: math.hcf(45,60)\n            Call2: math.hcf(90,120)\n            Call3: math.hcf(36,48)\n            Call4: math.hcf(72,96)\n\n        Then in the next turn, we get the results: \n            h1, h2, h3, h4.\n\n        Then we can do:\n            Turn 2:\n                Call5: math.hcf(h1, h2)   -> resultA\n                Call6: math.hcf(h3, h4)   -> resultB\n\n        But note: the problem asks for both parts. We are allowed to do multiple turns.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do the first set in one turn and the second set in the next? But the problem doesn't specify order.\n\n   However, the system expects us to complete the task in as many turns as needed.\n\n   But note: the instruction says \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn.\" meaning we should do as much as we can in one turn? \n\n   In the first turn, we can only do the independent computations: the four HCFs for the pairs.\n\n   Then in the second turn, we do the two final HCFs.\n\n   However, the instruction also says: \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\n   So we will break it into two turns.\n\n   Turn 1: \n        We output:\n            <TOOLCALL>\n                <functions>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n                        <params>\n                            <param name=\"number1\" value=\"45\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                            <param name=\"number2\" value=\"60\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                        </params>\n                    </function>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n                        <params>\n                            <param name=\"number1\" value=\"90\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                            <param name=\"number2\" value=\"120\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                        </params>\n                    </function>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n                        <params>\n                            <param name=\"number1\" value=\"36\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                            <param name=\"number2\" value=\"48\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                        </params>\n                    </function>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n                        <params>\n                            <param name=\"number1\" value=\"72\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                            <param name=\"number2\" value=\"96\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                        </params>\n                    </function>\n                </functions>\n            </TOOLCALL>\n\n   Then the system will run these and return the results: h1, h2, h3, h4.\n\n   Turn 2:\n        We then use the results to compute:\n            resultA = hcf(h1, h2)\n            resultB = hcf(h3, h4)\n\n        So we output:\n            <TOOLCALL>\n                <functions>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n                        <params>\n                            <param name=\"number1\" value=\"h1\" type=\"integer\"/>   <!-- but we must use the actual value returned for h1 -->\n                            <param name=\"number2\" value=\"h2\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                        </params>\n                    </function>\n                    <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n                        <params>\n                            <param name=\"number1\" value=\"h3\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                            <param name=\"number2\" value=\"h4\" type=\"integer\"/>\n                        </params>\n                    </function>\n                </functions>\n            </TOOLCALL>\n\n   However, in the second turn we don't have the actual numbers until the first turn is executed. But in the function call, we must put the actual values? \n\n   But note: we are in a multi-turn setting. In the first turn, we output the first set of function calls. The system will run them and then in the next turn, we (the assistant) will see the results and then generate the next function calls.\n\n   Therefore, in the first turn we only output the first four function calls.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format ...\". And we are allowed to do multiple turns.\n\n   So for the first turn, we do the independent computations.\n\n   However, the instruction says: \"At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks\". We are not completing the entire task in one turn, but we are doing as much as we can.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do the first set (45,60) and (90,120) and then immediately the combination for the first set in the same turn? \n        But we cannot because we don't have the result of (45,60) and (90,120) until the system runs them.\n\n   Therefore, we break it.\n\n   But note: the system does not allow us to chain in one turn because we cannot use the result of a function call in the same turn without the system running it first.\n\n   So we do:\n\n   Turn 1: \n        We only have the initial request. We break it into two steps.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify that we have to do it in one turn. So we do:\n\n        Turn 1: \n            We output the four function calls for the pairs.\n\n        Turn 2: \n            We receive the results and then output the two function calls for the final combinations.\n\n        Then we are done.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Please also find ...\", meaning we are to do both parts. We are doing both in two turns.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do the first set in two turns and the second set in two turns? That would be four turns? Not efficient.\n\n   We can do the independent computations for both sets in the first turn, then the dependent ones in the second.\n\n   So we choose that.\n\n   Therefore, for the first turn, we output the four function calls for the pairs.\n\n   Let's write the first turn function calls:\n\n   Note: The parameters must be in the correct type (integer) and we are passing the numbers as given.\n\n   We are calling:\n        math.hcf(45,60)\n        math.hcf(90,120)\n        math.hcf(36,48)\n        math.hcf(72,96)\n\n   We output these in the <TOOLCALL> block.\n\n   Then in the next turn, we will get the results and then compute the two final HCFs.\n\n   But note: the user might want the answers for both parts. We are not done until we compute the final results.\n\n   We will do the second turn when we get the results.\n\n   However, for the first turn, we only output the first set of calls.\n\n   So the first turn response is:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"number1\" value=\"45\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"number2\" value=\"60\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"number1\" value=\"90\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"number2\" value=\"120\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"number1\" value=\"36\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"number2\" value=\"48\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"number1\" value=\"72\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"number2\" value=\"96\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n   Then in the next turn, we will use the results to compute the final two.\n\n   However, note: the system will return the results for the four calls. We will then have:\n\n        result1 = hcf(45,60)   -> let's call this r1\n        result2 = hcf(90,120)   -> r2\n        result3 = hcf(36,48)    -> r3\n        result4 = hcf(72,96)    -> r4\n\n   Then we need to compute:\n        r5 = hcf(r1, r2)\n        r6 = hcf(r3, r4)\n\n   So in the next turn, we output:\n\n<TOOLCALL>\n<functions>\n  <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"number1\" value=\"r1\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"number2\" value=\"r2\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n  <function name=\"math.hcf\">\n    <params>\n      <param name=\"number1\" value=\"r3\" type=\"integer\"/>\n      <param name=\"number2\" value=\"r4\" type=\"integer\"/>\n    </params>\n  </function>\n</functions>\n</TOOLCALL>\n\n   But note: we don't know r1, r2, r3, r4 until the system returns them. So in the next turn, we will have to use the actual values that the system returns.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot write the second turn until we see the results.\n\n   But the assistant in the second turn will have the results from the first turn. So we will generate the second turn accordingly.\n\n   However, for the first turn, we only do the first step.\n\n   So we output the first set of four function calls.\n\n   Let's code accordingly."}

We are allowed to output multiple function calls in one TOOLCALL block.\n\n Let's structure the calls:\n\n For New York:\n   location: \"New York, NY\"\n   facilities: [\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]\n\n For Los Angeles:\n   location: \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n   facilities: [\"Wi-Fi\", \"Children Section\"]\n\n For Chicago:\n   location: \"Chicago, IL\"\n   facilities: [\"Cafe\", \"Reading Room\"]\n\n We will create three <function> elements within the <functions> tag.\n\n Important: The type for the facilities parameter is array. In the XML representation, we represent the array as a comma-separated list of values? \n But note: the specification says the type must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple. However, in the XML representation of the parameters, we must represent the array in a way that the system can parse.\n\n How to represent an array in the XML? We can use a string representation? But the type is array. The system expects an array.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The type fields of the parameters in your function calls must be one of: string, integer, float, boolean, array, dict, or tuple.\" \n And in the function definition, the facilities parameter is of type array.\n\n However, in the XML we are writing, we are only allowed to put a string value? But note: the specification does not specify the exact serialization for array, but we must use a format that the system can parse.\n\n Since the example does not show an array, we have to decide. We can represent an array of strings as a comma-separated string? But that might break if a string contains a comma.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent it as a JSON string? But the type is array, so the system might expect a JSON array string.\n\n However, the problem does not specify. Let's assume that the system expects the value to be a string that can be parsed as a JSON array.\n\n So for the facilities array in New York, we would write:\n   value='[\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]'\n\n But note: the function definition says the facilities parameter is an array. So we must represent it as an array.\n\n However, the toolcall format we are using is XML, and we are writing the value as a string attribute. Therefore, we have to serialize the array to a string.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the serialization, but we know that the function expects an array, we can use JSON serialization.\n\n Alternatively, the system might support a different representation? But to be safe, we'll use JSON.\n\n But note: the example in the function description does not show how to pass an array. We must follow the specification.\n\n Since the instruction says: \"You should only return the function calls in the <TOOLCALL> section\", and the format is fixed, we must use a string representation that the system can parse as an array.\n\n We'll use JSON because it is standard.\n\n Therefore, for the facilities parameter, we will set the value to a JSON array string, and the type remains \"array\".\n\n However, note that the XML attribute value is a string. So we must escape any quotes? Actually, in XML we can use CDATA? But the format we are using does not allow that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the JSON string? But the JSON standard uses double quotes.\n\n How about: \n   <param name=\"facilities\" value='[\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n\n But note: the value attribute is in double quotes in the XML. So we have to use single quotes for the entire value? Actually, we can use double quotes inside if we escape? \n\n But the problem says: \"You MUST put it in the format of ...\", and the example uses double quotes for the value. So we cannot change that.\n\n Therefore, we must escape the double quotes inside the JSON string? Actually, we can use single quotes for the JSON string? But JSON requires double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following representation without quotes? But that would not be valid JSON.\n\n We have a problem. Let me reexamine the function definition: the facilities parameter is an array. How is the array represented? The function expects an array of strings.\n\n The system that processes the toolcall might accept a string that is a JSON array. So we write the value as a string that is a JSON array, but then we must escape the double quotes in the XML.\n\n We can write: \n   value=\"[&quot;Reading Room&quot;, &quot;Fiction&quot;]\"\n\n But that is not standard. Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the entire attribute and then use double quotes inside? \n\n The example format: \n   <param name=\"param1\" value=\"value1\" type=\"type1\"/>\n\n So the value is in double quotes. Therefore, we must escape any double quotes inside the value. But the standard way in XML is to use &quot; for a double quote.\n\n So for the array, we can represent it as:\n   value=\"[&quot;Reading Room&quot;, &quot;Fiction&quot;]\"\n\n However, this is cumbersome. Alternatively, we might not need to use quotes in the JSON array? But that is not valid JSON.\n\n The function expects an array of strings. The array must be passed as a string that can be parsed. We choose JSON.\n\n Therefore, we escape the double quotes in the JSON string by replacing \" with &quot;.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the entire attribute? The example uses double quotes for the entire attribute, so we must use double quotes.\n\n So we escape the inner double quotes.\n\n Example for New York facilities: \n   value=\"[&quot;Reading Room&quot;, &quot;Fiction&quot;]\"\n\n But note: the system that receives this will unescape the XML and then parse the string as JSON? \n\n Alternatively, the system might not require escaping because the XML parser will unescape the entities. But to be safe, we do it.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact method. Since we are to output the function calls in the specified XML format, we must output well-formed XML.\n\n Therefore, we will escape the double quotes inside the value.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid escaping by using single quotes for the entire attribute? But the example uses double quotes for the attribute. And the specification says \"in the format\", so we stick to double quotes.\n\n But note: the example format uses double quotes for the entire attribute. So we must escape.\n\n However, there is another way: we can use single quotes for the entire attribute value? The XML specification allows both.\n\n We can write:\n   value='[\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]'\n\n This is valid and does not require escaping.\n\n Since the example does not specify which quote to use, and to avoid escaping, we can use single quotes for the entire attribute value.\n\n So let's use single quotes for the entire value string when it contains double quotes.\n\n For example:\n   <param name=\"facilities\" value='[\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n\n This is valid XML.\n\n We'll do that.\n\n Now, let's write the three function calls.\n\n Note: The function name is \"public_library.find_nearby\".\n\n We'll create:\n\n <TOOLCALL>\n   <functions>\n      <function name=\"public_library.find_nearby\">\n         <params>\n            <param name=\"location\" value=\"New York, NY\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"facilities\" value='[\"Reading Room\", \"Fiction\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n         </params>\n      </function>\n      <function name=\"public_library.find_nearby\">\n         <params>\n            <param name=\"location\" value=\"Los Angeles, CA\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"facilities\" value='[\"Wi-Fi\", \"Children Section\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n         </params>\n      </function>\n      <function name=\"public_library.find_nearby\">\n         <params>\n            <param name=\"location\" value=\"Chicago, IL\" type=\"string\"/>\n            <param name=\"facilities\" value='[\"Cafe\", \"Reading Room\"]' type=\"array\"/>\n         </params>\n      </function>\n   </functions>\n </TOOLCALL>\n\n However, note that the function description says: \"facilities\" is an array. We are representing it as a JSON string, but the type is still \"array\". The system should parse it.\n\n Alternatively, if the system expects a different representation, we might have to adjust. But without more information, this is the best we can do.\n\n Let's output accordingly."}
