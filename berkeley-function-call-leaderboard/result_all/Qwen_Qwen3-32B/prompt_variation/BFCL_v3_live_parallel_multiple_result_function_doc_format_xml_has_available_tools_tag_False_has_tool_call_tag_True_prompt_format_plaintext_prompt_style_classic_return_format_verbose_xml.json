There's ChaFod for modifying food items and ChaDri.change_drink for drinks. \n\nFor the Caesar salad, ChaFod is the right choice. The required parameter is foodItem, which is \"Caesar salad\". The user wants to remove anchovies, so I'll use the removeIngredients parameter. The value should be \"anchovies\". No new ingredients or special instructions mentioned, so those can be omitted.\n\nNext, the drink order. The function is ChaDri.change_drink. The drink_id is \"123\". The new preferences need to be a dictionary. The user specified \"large hot coffee\", so size is \"large\", type is \"hot coffee\", sweetness is \"regular\", and milk is \"almond\". So the new_preferences dict should include these key-value pairs. All parameters are required, so that's covered.\n\nNeed to make sure the types are correct.

The user wants me to clone a repo, analyze it, create/update Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, then commit and push the changes.\n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository using the provided URL. The function clone_repo is perfect here. The URL is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. I'll use that as the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so I'll omit it, which means it'll clone to the current directory. No need for recursive or depth parameters here unless specified, which they aren't. So the first function call is clone_repo with repo_url set.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents to determine the programming language. The function analyse_repo_contents takes the directory name. Since the repo is cloned into the current directory, the directory_name is probably \"nodejs-welcome\". I'll use that.\n\nOnce I know the language (assuming it's Node.js from the repo name), I need to create a Dockerfile. The function create_a_docker_file requires the directory_name. Again, \"nodejs-welcome\" should be the directory. Then, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs the directory_name, and maybe other parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. But the user didn't specify those, so I'll use defaults. The image name could be based on the directory, maybe \"nodejs-welcome:latest\". Deployment name could be the same. Replicas might default to 1, port 80, service type ClusterIP. But since the user didn't specify, the function will use defaults where possible.\n\nAfter creating the files, I need to add the changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function will handle that. The directory_name is \"nodejs-welcome\", commit_message should be something like \"Add Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs\", and branch_name is probably \"main\" unless specified otherwise. Force_push is false unless needed.\n\nWait, the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\", which implies git add, commit, and push. The push function's description says it will automatically git add all changes, so I just need to call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory, commit message, and branch.\n\nSo the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. Each step requires a function call. The parameters for Kubernetes might need defaults, but the function allows some parameters to be optional. I'll fill in the required ones and let the function handle the rest."}

Also, the urgent flag is optional, so I can leave it out.\n\nWait, if the search doesn't find anything, maybe I should still send the message? The user said \"regardless\", so maybe just send it even if not found. But the first step is to search. So first call recall_memory_search, then send the message. But how to chain these? Since each function call is a turn, maybe the system will handle the next step after getting the search results. For now, just do the search first."}

First, they're encountering a compilation error in their Java project related to the 'StringNumberHandler' class extending 'AbstractCellHandler'. The specific issue is that the method 'getNumericValue()' can't be found in 'CellResult'. \n\nThe user has two main requests. First, they want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. Second, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class to ensure correct overriding.\n\nStarting with the first request: finding relevant classes for 'CellResult'. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters required are 'search_string', 'case_sensitive', and 'include_subdirectories'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I'll set 'include_subdirectories' to true. The search string is 'CellResult', and since they didn't mention case sensitivity, I'll default that to false.\n\nNext, for the second request: getting the method signatures. The 'get_signature' function is the right choice. I'll need to call this function twice, once for each method ('setCellValue' and 'getCellValue') in the 'AbstractCellHandler' class. The parameters required are 'class_name', 'method_name', and optionally 'include_private'. Since the user didn't mention private methods, I'll omit that parameter or set it to false. \n\nWait, the user is working in Java, and the functions don't specify a language parameter. But the functions seem to be designed for a general-purpose use, so maybe the module or class names are sufficient. The 'get_signature' function requires the class name and method name. I should make sure that the 'AbstractCellHandler' is the correct class name in their code. \n\nI should check if the 'get_relevant_classes' function might return other classes that could help identify the correct 'CellResult' class, which might be in a different package. Once the relevant classes are found, the user might need to adjust their imports or check the hierarchy. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned a compilation error about 'getNumericValue()' not being found. This suggests that 'CellResult' might not have that method, or perhaps they need to cast it to a different type. But without knowing the actual structure, the first step is to find the relevant classes to understand what methods are available.\n\nSo, the plan is to first call 'get_relevant_classes' with 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then, call 'get_signature' for both methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'. This should provide the necessary information to check the method overrides and possibly resolve the 'CellResult' issue by examining the relevant classes."}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method found for get_weather(String). They want to know the available methods in the 'Weather' class and the signature of get_weather if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to check what functions I have available. The get_class_info function can retrieve info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. So I should call that with the class name 'Weather'. The parameters required are class_name, and optionally include_private and module_name. Since the user didn't mention a module, I'll omit module_name. Also, the error is about a method that takes a String, so maybe private methods are involved? But by default, include_private is false, so maybe the method is public. Let's first check the public methods.\n\nSo first function call: get_class_info with class_name='Weather'.\n\nNext, if the get_weather method exists, I need its signature. The get_signature function requires class_name, method_name, and include_private. So after getting the class info, if get_weather is present, I need to call get_signature with class_name='Weather', method_name='get_weather'. Again, include_private might be needed if the method is private, but the error suggests it's not found at all, so maybe it's not present or has a different name.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'get_weather(String)', which implies the method takes a String parameter. The signature would show the parameters. So after retrieving the class info, if the method exists, the signature will show the parameters. But first, I need to check if the method exists in the class.\n\nSo the first step is to get the class info for 'Weather' to see all available methods. Then, check if 'get_weather' is among them. If it is, then get its signature. If not, maybe the method has a different name or is in a different class.\n\nBut the user's question is to identify the available methods for 'Weather' and provide the signature if it exists. So the first function call is get_class_info for 'Weather', then if needed, get_signature for 'get_weather'.\n\nSo the first tool call is get_class_info with class_name='Weather'.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember there's a function called math_gcd available. The parameters required are two non-negative integers. Since 36 and 48 are both non-negative, I can directly use this function. So I'll need to call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Oh right, 48 is larger than 36, so a should be 48 and b 36.\n\nNow for the second part, the user is asking about the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. Steepness here refers to the derivative of the function at that point. The available function for this is estimate_derivative. The parameters needed are the function, the point x, and optionally dx and method. The function f(x) is x squared, so I need to pass that as a callable. However, in the parameters, the type for 'function' is listed as 'any', which might be a bit tricky. But assuming that the system can handle passing a lambda or a reference to the function. The point x is 5. The dx and method are optional, but to get an accurate estimate, using a central difference method with a small dx (like 0.0001) would be ideal. However, if the default method and dx are sufficient, maybe those parameters can be omitted. But since the user didn't specify, I should probably include the method as 'central' and a small dx. Wait, the function's parameters have 'method' as a string, so I can set it to 'central' for better accuracy. \n\nPutting it all together, first call math_gcd with 48 and 36. Then call estimate_derivative with function=x\u00b2, x=5, dx=0.0001, method='central'. But wait, how do I represent the function f(x) = x\u00b2 in the parameters? The function expects a callable object. If the system allows, maybe it's possible to pass a lambda function like lambda x: x**2. But the parameter type is 'any', so I'll have to assume that's acceptable. \n\nSo the two function calls would be:\n\n1. math_gcd(a=48, b=36)\n2. estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5, dx=0.0001, method='central')\n\nI need to make sure that all required parameters are included. For estimate_derivative, 'function' and 'x' are required. The user didn't specify dx or method, but providing them would make the derivative estimation more precise. The default values might not be specified, so including them is better. \n\nTherefore, the correct tool calls are the two functions mentioned above."}

The user wants two things: first, calculate the GCD of 36 and 48, and then estimate the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5.\n\nStarting with the GCD. The math_gcd function requires two positive integers. The user provided 36 and 48, which are both positive integers. So I can directly use the math_gcd function here. The parameters a and b should be 36 and 48. Wait, the description says a is the first and larger integer. Wait, 48 is larger than 36. Oh, does the order matter for GCD? No, because GCD(a, b) is the same as GCD(b, a). So even if a is supposed to be the larger one, the function might handle it regardless. But the parameters are required, so I'll assign a=48 and b=36? Or maybe the function expects a and b in any order. The description says \"the first and larger positive integer\", so maybe a should be the larger one. So a=48, b=36. But the user input is 36 and 48. Wait, the user says \"the numbers 36 and 48\". The function's parameters are a and b, both required. So regardless of order, since GCD is commutative, the result will be the same. So I can call math_gcd with a=36 and b=48, or a=48 and b=36. Either way, the GCD is 12. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext, estimating the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The estimate_derivative function is available. The parameters needed are the function, x, dx, and method. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2, which can be represented as a lambda function. The x value is 5. The dx is optional, but for better accuracy, a small value like 0.0001 is typically used. The method is also optional; if not specified, it might default to a central difference or forward difference. The user didn't specify the method, so maybe we can omit it or use a default. The function requires the 'function' parameter, which is the callable. So in the tool call, I need to represent the function as a lambda. However, in the XML parameters, how do I represent a lambda function? The type is \"any\", so perhaps the user expects a string representation. Wait, the function's parameter for 'function' is type \"any\", which might be a bit tricky. The description says \"A callable function for which the derivative will be estimated, like the lambda x\". So maybe the user is supposed to input a lambda expression as a string. For example, in Python, it would be lambda x: x**2. But in the tool call, how to represent that? The parameter expects a value, so perhaps the value is written as a string that represents the lambda. So the value would be \"lambda x: x**2\". Then, the x is 5.0 (float), and dx could be 0.0001 if not provided. Since dx is optional, if not given, maybe the function uses a default. But the user might want to specify it. However, the user didn't mention dx or method, so perhaps we can omit them. So the estimate_derivative call would have function as \"lambda x: x**2\", x=5.0. The method can be omitted. The dx could also be omitted, but maybe including a small dx like 0.0001 would be better. Wait, the user didn't specify dx, so maybe we should just use the default. But the function's parameters for dx are required=false. So the tool call can include the function and x, and optionally dx and method. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps we can proceed without them. However, in practice, the derivative estimation might need a dx. So maybe the user expects a default value. But since the tool call requires explicit parameters, perhaps we need to include dx. But the user hasn't provided it. Hmm. The problem says \"estimate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point x = 5\". The user didn't specify dx or method, so perhaps we can assume default values. For example, dx=0.0001 and method='central' or something. But since the function's parameters for dx and method are optional, we can omit them. However, the function might require dx to be provided. Wait, looking back at the function definition for estimate_derivative: dx is required=false. So it's optional. So the tool call can include just the function and x. But how does the function handle that? Well, the function's implementation would have a default dx. So in the tool call, we can proceed with just the function and x. So the parameters would be function=\"lambda x: x**2\", x=5.0. \n\nPutting it all together, the first function call is math_gcd with a=36 and b=48. Then, the second function call is estimate_derivative with function as the lambda and x=5.0. The order matters here because the user asked to first calculate the GCD and then estimate the derivative. So the tool calls should be in that sequence."}

Let me make sure there are no typos in the city names. Boston, MA is correct. San Francisco's state abbreviation is CA. Yes. \n\nSo two separate function calls are needed here. Each with their own parameters. The user didn't mention anything else, so no other functions are necessary. I think that's all."}

The user is asking for all pending and active mandates for users named Parath and Bhanu. Hmm. The available functions are user.mandates and partner.mandates. \n\nFirst, the user.mandates function requires a user's name and an optional status. Since the user wants both pending and active, maybe I need to call this function twice for each user, once for each status. Wait, but the status parameter is a single string. So if I want both pending and active, I can't specify both in one call. So for each user, I need two separate calls: one with status \"pending\" and another with \"active\".\n\nAlternatively, does the API allow multiple statuses? The function's parameters don't mention that. The status is a single string. So probably, each call can only fetch one status. Therefore, for each user, two function calls are needed.\n\nSo for Parath and Bhanu, that's two users, each needing two calls. So total four function calls. Let me check the parameters again. The user.mandates function requires the name and optional status. So each call would be user.mandates with name=Parath and status=pending, then name=Parath and status=active, then same for Bhanu.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the partner.mandates function could be used if these users are partners. But the partner.mandates function doesn't take a user name. It only takes status. So if Parath and Bhanu are partners, then partner.mandates with status=pending and active. But the problem is that the partner.mandates function retrieves mandates for the partner, not for their clients. The user.mandates function is for partners to get their clients' mandates. So if Parath and Bhanu are clients of the partner, then user.mandates is the correct one.\n\nSo the correct approach is to call user.mandates for each user and each status. Therefore, four function calls in total. Let me structure that."}
